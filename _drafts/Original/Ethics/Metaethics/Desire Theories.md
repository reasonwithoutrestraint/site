## Desire Theories

!!! danger "Deprecate"
	Delete this section. Consider the pros and cons of desire theories when discussing the merits of various forms of internalism.

This examines theories for normative correctness that reduce in some way to an agents desires, whether first-order or higher-order, actual or hypothetical, etc.

### Humean Model

The Humean theory of rationality states the following

A has a reason to X if and only if (1) X promotes A's desire d and (2) d is not based on any false beliefs. This can be simplified to: A has a reason to X if and only if X promotes a foundational (rather than derivative) desire in A. Desires are then the upshot of the following 

- Full information
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).

Desires can be given three components:

* A certain positive or negative sensation
* A disposition to promote some state of affairs
* An unreflective normative judgment that one has reason to promote a state of affairs

Not clear if an "urge" can be reduced to a sensation/disposition pair.

**Problems**

These are problems insofar as desires are divorced from normative judgments (e.g. plans, goals, etc.).

* Normativity of desires: Why would a desire, in terms of just sensations and dispositions, provide someone with reasons for action? Imagine someone had a disposition where they just felt the urge to turn on radios whenever they saw one but they didn't think they had any reason to do so. Imagine A is injected with a drug that makes him crave the drug much more, and this is his strongest desire by far. Does he have most reason to take the drug?
* Disconnects: Assume the normativity of desires are accounted for. How to account for disconnects between an agent's reasons and their desires? These disconnects can happen under physical addiction, emotional disturbances, psychological compulsions, etc.
	- We sometimes have reasons without corresponding desires - e.g. weakness of will
	- We sometimes have desires without corresponding reasons - e.g. addictions 
	- These cannot be accounted for with full information. There can be degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on one's hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would be against coming into contact with germs because of an intrinsic disgust reaction, and they would think, all things else considered, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires. The fact that full information would produce certain responses in people doesn't make those responses rational.
* Priority: Assume the disconnect between reasons and desires is accounted for (perhaps by looking at a mode of desires). On this model, the authority of desires are simply based on their "strength". 
	- How does this account for the authority we want to give to categorically superior desires? E.g. the priority of higher-order desires or desires under full experience, reflection, sound state of mind, etc. which may have low strength? 
	- How can we ground criticisms of fully informed desires that are based on inexperience, lack of reflection, unsound, etc.?
* Prudence: Why agents have reason to satisfy the desires of their future self?

### Dispositionalism / Sophisticated Humean Model

The idealization for discovering reasons requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end-deliberation. Some other possibilities include. We can supplement the Humean model by incorportating other requirements:

- Fully Informed
- Correct means-end deliberation.
- Reflection - desires endorsed under reflection have priority over others
	- Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
	- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Soundness - free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Fully Experienced - not merely knowledge of a proposition p, but exposure to a stimuli (i.e. a perception, an argument, etc.) that provokes the attitude.
- Systematically unified desires.

Reasons = Full Experience + Full Information + Full Reflection + Sound mental state + ... 

At bottom, the concern is that we are starting with an agent's given motivational set and find a sound deliberative route or procedure with the aforemention properties to discover reasons.

Some theories allow the creation/destruction of underived desires. Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one's interests at the expense of others) are irrational. This is because some theories are "fully rational", not merely fully informed, where "fully rational" extends beyond correct ends-means deliberation. This is necessary to handle irrational desires.

**Problems**

Hasn't solved the following problems from above:

- Normativity of desires: why do mere sensations/dispositions even under idealized circumstances, in the absence of a normative judgment, provide a reason for action? It doesn't seem that they do. Instead, we should focus on the normative judgments an agent would make (e.g. their plans, goals), under these idealized conditions.
- Unification: what do these conditions all have in common? It cannot just be that we all desire to satisfy the desires that we would have under these conditions because not everyone has this desire.
- Priority: assume everyone does actually desire the desires they would have under idealized conditions. What gives these desires the priority that they have? On desire-based theories, priority must be determined purely by "strength" and very often we can have desires that are stronger than our desire to satisfy the desires we would have under idealized conditions. 

??? example "Ideal Observer"

	See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith

	Ideal agent vs Ideal Observer: *Ideal agent*: an agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of themselves, A+, would desire to X in C. *Ideal Observer*: an ideal agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. 

	*Observer-based not agent-based.* The reasons that X has reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X, not whether A+ would desire X. This is because doing otherwise cannot account for reasons under uncertainty. Consider the case when one has reason to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though they have reason to do so.

	It's not clear why this means we should focus on observers rather than agents. For example, imagine the case where someone drinks a glass of soda that they believe to be water and they desire to drink water. We can easily say that they have reason to not drink from the glass, even though they do have reason to drink from the glass given the information that they have. In this case, there is no problem with saying someone has most reason to do something which they have no rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs. Likewise, it seems we can say that people don't actually have reason to seek information, but rather they have reason to seek information given their currently held beliefs. There is no problem with saying, for example, that someone lost in the woods has most reason to take route X, even though this is not something which they have a rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs.

	**Problems** 

	- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do? What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis... This, combined with the earlier notes on ideal observer, might be enough to ignore the observer aspect and focus on the agent. We can distinguish what to do under uncertainty versus full information by distinguishing rationality and reasons.
	- ~~~They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.~~~ Actually, this can account for rationality in general. The full information requirement is not to account for *rationality*, but to account for *reasons*. It is full information + rationality that provides reasons. The account of rationality is independent from full information, and this account can be extended to other domains.

### General Problems

General problems with desire accounts and counterfactual attitude accounts.

1. The elements posited as providing reasons (desires, informed desires, motivations, ideal desires, ideal observer's desires, etc.) don't necessarily provide reasons, i.e. when they disconnect with an agent's normative judgments. Consider a case where dispositionalism (but not constructivism) would say someone has reason. On what grounds can the person be said to have that reason if they are not in some way committed to the action?
2. Insofar as they do provide reasons, constructivism explains why they provide reasons, why they matter and a unifying theme explaining the authority of the elements that do matter. E.g. if certain features are constituitive of agency, caring about desires under experience, future desires, etc.
3. Constructivism can give a clean general account of all reasons.
	- How to give a metaphysical account of reasons for belief? One response is that one has reason to believe P only if they would believe P in circumstance P. How to account for a reason to believe *that* counterfactual? The response is that one has reason to believe that they would believe P in circumstances C iff they would believe that "they would believe P in circumstances C" in circumstances C. This is circular... This may not actually be an issue on the metaphysical/epistemic level. It may still be an issue on the linguistic/psychological level, however.
