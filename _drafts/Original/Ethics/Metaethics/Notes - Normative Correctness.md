The Moral Problem

1. Moral judgments are truth-apt.
2. Truth-apt judgments must be beliefs (i.e. descriptive).
3. Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.
4. Beliefs are not sufficient for intrinsic motivation.

## The Deliberative Perspective

Intentional action can be explained from two perspectives, the *intentional* and the *deliberative*. From the intentional perspective, intentional action can be explained by citiing *motivating reasons*, i.e. by citing a belief-desire pair that fits into a pattern of teleological explanation. From the deliberative perspective, intentional action can be explained by citing *normative reasons*, i.e. by citing a pattern of rational deliberation that either did, or could have, produced it. This involves citing the considerations that one reflects over in deciding what to do. 

The deliberative perspective must be explanatory because when we decide what to do after deliberation, that often makes a difference in what we do. This would be impossible if the deliberative perspective were not explanatory, since the connection between deliberation and our action would be purely causally contingent. Thus, our attitudes towards the propositions that figure in our deliberations must be capable of figuring an explanation of our action. 

However, there must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action and the agent's motivating reasons for action.

To judge that one has normative reason to X is to *endorse* X under deliberation. Normative judgments then can be vaguely characterized as *deliberative endorsement* of some propositional content. Contrast this with undeliberative or unreflective endorsement, which are the sources of one's *motivating reasons*, the explanation of their intentional behavior. Voluntary actions can be explained by a belief and desire; these actions are done on the basis of normative reasnoing insofar as deliberation and reflection play a role in how the belief and desire manifest into action, e.g. if deliberation influences what one desires, which desires are actualized, etc. The question is to determine what it is to form deliberative endorsement of an action. Is it a desire, belief of some sort, etc?

Maybe there is a third perspective, in between the deliberative and the intentional, the notion of a non-deliberative decision that does not manifest itself into an intention. For example, consider someone lying in their bed who decides to grab a piece of cake to eat, but this doesn't manifest itself in the form of an intention because the person is too lazy. This would be a consciously endorsed desire, but not the active desire (i.e. intention). Further, we can imagine that this is not a deliberatively endorsed desire, if e.g. the person also believed that he shouldn't eat the cake.

## Competing Analyses

### Dispositions

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to accept a system of norms that prescribe X-ing, i.e. be disposed to avow X in normative discussion.

### World-to-mind-fit

Note that world-to-mind fits are also dispositions. But they are different from general dispositions in that they consist of dispositions to realize or actualize a state of affairs, as opposed to, say, a disposition to avow or express a norm.

Desires are states with a functional, dispositional role. To desire to D is to be disposed to X in conditions where they believe they can D by X-ing.

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X.
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X in the proper psychological state (i.e. tests of reflection and experience, free of various psychological disturbances, etc).
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire to desire X.

Scanlon criticized this characterization of desires as purely functional, disposition states. A key aspect of desiring X is an evaluative component, i.e. that there seems to be *reason* to promote X. A functional, dispositional state (even with a certain sensation) that doesn't include this evaluative component doesn't seem like a desire. E.g. a man who was disposed to turn on every radio he saw even though he saw no reason to do so wouldn't seem like he's acting on a desire.

### Mind-to-world fit 

Currently, these include just counterfactual beliefs about one's desires:

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed.
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed and fully rational. 

#### Fully Rational

To serve as a useful analysis, fully rational must be given a reductive account, i.e. in explaining what it is to judge that one has a normative reason, we should not have to refer back to an unexplained normative judgment. Some components of rationality include the following: (1) full information, (2) correct means-end deliberation, (3) sound state of mind, (4) full reflection/deliberation, (5) full experience, etc.

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms. Otherwise, it doesn't really illuminate what normative reasons consist in. Michael Smith's characterization does make use of normative terms (he thinks the concept of "unity" and "truth" is normative), but this is because his account of rationality is irreductive.

## My Position

Some general requirements:

- Judgment Internalism: if A judges that they have normative reason to X, then this usually explains and produces a motivating reason to X.
- Normative Universalization: the account of normative reasons must apply to reasons for actions, beliefs, and attitudes. Conceivably, these are all attitudes for beliefs are attitudes and reasons for actions are usually characterized in terms of reasons for desires/intentions which are also attitudes. The reason the analysis should be universal is because when we endorse one class of attitudes (e.g. desires or intentions) under deliberation, this seems similar to when we endorse another (e.g. beliefs) under deliberation.

I endorse a kind of special world-to-mind-fit attitude that is distinct from desires. It may be that the state cannot be reduced to any other kind of psychological state.

### Problems with desire theories

- If one just has urge or sensation, this doesn't seem like a normative judgment.
- Insofar as one values X they have to value the means to achieve X. The same doesn't apply by swapping "value" for "desire".
- This may lead to using desires as the standard of correctness for normative judgments. This is critiqued in Rational Correctness.md

### World-to-mind

Normative judgments, or deliberative endorsement, is a world-to-mind state of mind. This best explains why people who judge that they have normative reason to X are disposed to X. If it was a mere mind-to-world state of mind, then there would have to be some additional world-to-mind state of mind that explained why one's deliberation influences their motivation, and *this* state of mind would be the core feature of normative judgments.

However, it doesn't seem that they are best characterized as desires. Might there be other forms of world-to-mind fit not adequately characterized as a desire? Goals and preferences seem to be a distinctive form of world-to-mind fit. And we can clearly understand how one might not have a desire to achieve one of their goals. It seems like the distinction between desires and goals is similar to the distinction between desires and normative judgments (values).

It seems like we can distinguish different world-to-mind fits based on their relationship to consciousness (thoughts) and deliberation (thoughts about thoughts). Types of world-to-mind attitudes with respect to propositional content X

- Dipsosition to involunarily X (involuntary action)
- Disposition to voluntarily X (voluntary reaction, habit)
- Disposition to voluntarily M where one believes M-> X (desire to X)
- Desire to X + awareness of the desire (preference to X)
- Conscious endorsement to X, regardless of desire (goal to X)

Might a goal to X adequately capture a judgment of normative reason? Does conscious endorsement of X amount to a deliberative endoresment of X? Deliberative endorsement can be explained as conscious endorsement after deliberation. The question the is, what constitutes conscious endorsement? What is this attitude? Perhaps it cannot be reduced any further.

### Candidates for a mind-to-world

A descriptivist analysis of normative judgments is possible only if it has the following components (attitude-dispositionalist).

- Attitudinal: They must related to properties tied to normative attitudes. E.g. "X is good" means "X has attitude-independent property Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y" could work.
- Internal Criticism: They must allow for coherent questioning of one's present attitudes. E.g. "X produces attitude Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y under particular (i.e. normal, preferred, ideal, etc.) circumstances" could work.

This leads to some sort of ideal response theory of normative judgments.

This may be able to satisfy the judgment internalism thesis. As a person would be motived to desire what they believed they would desire if they were fully rational/informed, insofar as they themselves are rational.

### Problems

- A successful position would have to be non-reductive. The ideal conditions must not be purely non-normative. E.g. "X produces attitude Y under typical circumstances" will not work. But "X produces Y under ideal, rational circumstances" could work. The reason is that if a person doesn't *endorse* the typical or naturalistically defined circumstances, then them saying that they would have a certain attitude in those circumstances would not constitute a normative judgment [Even if certain endorsements are constituive of rational agency (i.e. caring about one's ends, caring about judgments in certain circumstances, etc.), it is possible that someone could not know that (it might not be at their consciousness). Thus, they could coherently say that they would believe X under certain circumstances without endorsing those circumstances as relevant]. The problem is once you make it non-reductive, you still require an irreductive world-to-mind-fit to characterize this endorsement.
- It doesn't seem that this is what we're doing when we deliberate. It seems we're figuring out what to do, we're searching for an answer to a practical problem, not trying to discover what we would do in some far off circumstances. 
- Problem for Ideal Observer views: They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do. What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational. Smith thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent. But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis. This might be enough to ignore the observer aspect and focus on the agent. We can distinguish what to do under uncertainty versus full information by distinguishing rationality and reasons.
- ~~~They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A judges that he has normative reason to believe X in C iff he believes that an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A judges that he has normative reason to believe X iff he believes that an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.~~~ Actually, this can account for rationality in general. The full information requirement is not to account for *rationality*, but to account for *reasons*. It is full information + rationality that provides reasons. The account of rationality is independent from full information, and this account can be extended to other domains.
