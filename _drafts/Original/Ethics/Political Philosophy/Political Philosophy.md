## Formulation

Key aspects of Libertarianism
- Group vs Individual
	- Individuals are the only unit of analysis
	- Groups are sometimes a unit of analysis
- Aggregative vs Non-aggregative
	- Non-aggregative: an act is wrong if and only if it worsens a particular unit (in the right way).
	- Aggregative: an act is wrong if and only if it sufficiently worsens a sufficient number of individuals (even if no particular unit was sufficiently wronged). Further, an act is right if it sufficiently improves a sufficient number of units (even if particular units are sufficiently wronged).
- Effects vs Constraining Opportunity
	- Opportunity: an act is wrong if it constrains the opportunity for one to achieve a certain valued end (liberty, well-being, etc.).
	- Effects: an act is wrong if it diminishes some valued end for someone else, or fails to promote a valued end for someone else (liberty, well-being, etc.). 
- Well-being vs liberty
	- Liberty: the valued end is something like freedom of movement, autonomy, etc.
	- Well-being: the valued end is something like valuable experiences.

										Formulation
			==================================================================

### Why leftists should accept property rights (over one's body)
- we should be allowed to perform abortions, regardless of the benefits it would produce
- we should not be forced to donate organs to others, regardless of the minor costs it imposes on us
- we should not be forced work for others (e.g. slavery), regardless of its benefit to others

- we should be paid in proportion to our labor (which means we own our labor), even if the capitalist could more efficiently use the money he exploited for other causes
- we should be allowed to do drugs, even if the societal effects are negative
- we should be allowed to sleep with others for money, even if the societal effects are negative

- we should be allowed to practice whatever religion we want
- we should be allowed to marry who we want (e.g. gay marriage), even if it offends others
- we should be allowed to sleep with whoever we please, even if it offends others

Responses:
- These benefits are not large enough to outweigh the negatives of coercing people? Really? what about abortions? Forced organ donations? Forced work for others? Also, what about slaveowners who had approving slaves?
- Also, practically, who decides whether a benefit is large enough? What will ultimately happening is the mob or some special collective decides whether benefits are large enough. This effectively allows the mob to decide who gets married to whom, who can sleep with whom, which religions we can practice, etc.

-

Idealization:
- Assume the citizens are fully informed, fully moral, fully compatible interests. This makes political analysis pointless. We wouldn't need to use force.
- Assume incompatible interests among the citizens. Now, we must introduce democratic votes to figure out what to do. Still, no govenrment needed though. We wouldn't need to force people to follow the upshots of the votes. They would just follow them. Now, how to determine what should be up for democratic votes and how voting should be structured. Probably would be a limited, decentralized government.
- Assume immorality, but rights-respecting citizens. But assume we have fully informed, fully rational, fully law-respecting politicians. Now, what should the laws be? This establishes the PROPER function of government. This government is needed to assist those who need assistance, but who aren't helped by others (because the others refuse to help, they just refuse to violate anyone else's rights). 
- Assume rights-violating citizens. Now, the government must stop these rights violations. The government would also enforce the upshots of these democratic votes.
- Assume the politicians are flawed. Introduce checks/balances on the government to best approximate the PROPER functions of government given these flaws.
- Assume the citizens are uninformed, irrational. Introduce more limitations on democracy (not just limitations on the proper scope of democracy, i.e. what should be determined by popular vote, but restrictions on the power of the people on decisions that are subject to popular vote). E.g. epistocracy, representative vs direct democracy. Strike a balance between weight being given to the people (so their interests are considered) and more weight being gven to experts.

### Justifying property rights in general

- Empirical Assumptions
	- Assume fully rational, fully informed agents. For the sake of determining moral truth.
	- Assume it is important to human beings that we have unilateral, excludable, enforceable right to control certain resources.
	- Assume a broadly common good. E.g. all humans have a need for a share of primary goods.
- When property rights model should be used.
	- A has right to x != permission to x. Rather, A has right to x = A has permission to x AND no one else has permission to prevent A from x-ing. There may be cases where someone has a permission, but not a right, to x (e.g. the only way to save one's life is to kill another), but these are edge cases to not be discussed. There may be no moral truth. 
	- A right to x implies more than just permissions and prohibitions to x. A right to x also implies rights to retaliation if someone violates x, compensation/rectification if someone damages x, enforcement to protect others from violating their rights, rights to transfer one's rights, etc. It suggests a system of permissions and prohibitions.
	- Rights in general (property or otherwise) don't make sense when everyone is in dire circumstances due to no fault of their own, and the only way to escape is by subjecting others to such dire circumstances. Because in these cases, all individuals are permitted to sacrifice others to save themselves, so no one has rights.
	- Thus, rights talk only make sense for members of a particular group or society, where each individual is above a certain threshold.
- Common-sense approach:
	- It is not ordinarily permissible to violate someone else's property rights. Why is the state justified?. Implicit/Hypothetical consent? Paternalism? Consequentalism? Fails
	- Everyone agrees with self-ownership
		- Even liberals agree with self-ownership. They don’t permit forced organ redistribution, forced marriages, etc. just because it might benefit others more.
		- The disagreement isn’t over self-ownership. The disagreement is over competing conceptions of self-ownership. 
		- Libertarians, anarchists and liberals agree with self-ownership.
- Why Equality implies property rights
	- Any delineation of rights must have formal equality. There shoud be no reference to proper names.
	- Indeterminacy
		- Formal equality. “Treat like cases alike”, “Don’t include indexes in one’s principle”, etc. are not determinate.
		- Indeterminacy in structure of equality: E.g. voting: everyone’s vote matters equally, choose one person’s vote randomly, everyone gets their fair share of the benefits of a voting policy. E.g. ownership: everyone owns everything equally, everyone owns a fair share of resources, distribute benefits randomly.
		- Indeterminacy in object of equality: E.g. resources vs welfare, opportunity vs holding, etc.
	- The best kind of equality is the one that gives everyone a sovereign space to carve out their life. E.g. each of the following policies for voting formally equal, but some are worse than others.
		- One random citizen's vote which lasts forever.
		- One random vote that changes with time. One person's vote lasts for a day.
		- The majority's vote. 60% oppresses the 40% all of the time.
		- Distribute benefits of the votes are distributed evenly. 60% win 60% of the time, 40% win 40% of the time.
		- Choose policy such that people are free to live their own lives, uninterrupted by others. I.e. assign strong property rights to people. People should be permitted to carve out their own sovereign space to decide how thier lives go.
		- Imagine everyone has identical capacities such that all differences are due to differences in choices. In this case, everyone should be given equal ownership of material resources even if this doesn't produce the best overall outcome. This shows that ownership has inherent, non-derivative value.
- Other arguments
	- Accounts for morally relevant features, e.g. desert, responsibility, illegitimate preferences.
	- Mack's argument. From moral perogatives

### Delineating property rights:
- Start with a theory of property/entitlements. Who owns what? How can one come to own what?
	- Everyone owns themselves.
	- Private property: everyone is entitled opportunity to an equal share of equally distributable resources.
	- Common property: for resources that can not be feasibly distributed, their usage is determined by the democratic vote.
- All rights are negative rights. 
	- If A has a negative right to use property in a way X, then
		- others have no liberty-right to block A from attaining X, 
		- others have no claim-rights to prohibit A from X, 
		- others have no liberty-right to threaten A when trying to do X, and 
	- But surely people have moral duties to benefit others, right?
		- True, but A's moral duty to benefit B is not contingent on (i) B being in dire circumstances, or (ii) B having no alternative means to acquire the benefit, or (iii) B's lack of the benefit being due to no fault of his own.
		- And because rights are *enforceable* (when discussing property rights), and because A maintains his duty even when the above conditions are met, this implies that one is permitted to *force* A to benefit B even when all of the above conditions are not met, which I don't agree with.
		- So while people have moral duties, they should not be understood as the positive rights of others.
- What rights do ownership grant someone? As a general rule, delineate rights with the assumption that everyone has maximum liberty/claim-right to their property that can only be diminished if this interferes with someone else's property rights.
	- No liberty-rights to assault/threaten others, as this suppresses their liberty/claim-rights
	- Also, no strong claim-rights - e.g. that prohibit minor intrusions - as this suppresses everyone's liberty-rights. 
	- Exception Rights: 
		- Conditions. Exception rights apply when (a) Someone suffers a significant burden [they are blocked from exercising their ownership rights for some reason]  (b) due to no fault of their own (c) that can be alleviated with minor costs to others and (d) there is no alternative means to alleviate the burden. 
		- If (c) is not met, then one may be permitted to alleviate their burden by violating anothers' property right, but the property owner is also permitted to retaliate. I'm agnostic on when (b) is not met.
		- Arguments for exception rights:
			- Proper balance of liberty/claim rights and the anti-paralysis postulate.
			- Direct intuition on killing innocents. There are certain situations where it is permissible to kill innocents in self-defense, despite the fact that they own their bodies and are not guilty of an infraction that would waive this right. Thus, people are permitted to violate (what would normally be) one's ownership rights in perilous circumstances.
	- The state can help individuals escape perilous circumstances:
		- If they can escape peril by imposing a reasonable cost on the fortunate (e.g. taxation), then they have exception rights (i.e. the fortunate cannot retaliate) which the state can enforce.
		- Otherwise, they don’t have exception rights (i.e. the fortunate can retaliate), but they are permitted to nevertheless impose such costs (mutually dire cicumstance), which means the fortunate have no protective rights. The eradication of peril is necessary to secure rights. In fact, establishing a state may be the method for escaping peril that requires the minimum cost to everyone. In this case, everyone has a (enforceable) duty to support the state.

### Justified instances of interference:

Underlying principles that provide one the *right* to interfere:
1. In times to stop/constrain those who have/will violate self-ownership.
2. In times where protecting/exercising one's property requires intruding on an innocent to a reasonable degree. This is because no one can be obligated to lack their property rights through no fault of their own. 
	- E.g. Imagine someone is about to fall on you. If you zap them, they will die and you will live. Otherwise, you will die and they will live. Do you have the right to zap them before they crush you? Yes. What if they are innocent? That changes nothing.
	- You might say that they inititated interference (even if they are innocent). Okay, replace the falling person with a falling anchor. You can zap the anchor, but it will kill a random stranger.
--> combine into a single principle?
	- People are entitled to certain resources (their bodies and extrapersonal property)
	- People are morally obligated to respect these entitlements only if they have access to the resources to which they are entitled.

Specifics: people have the right to use interference to...
- Constrain someone who has/would violate one's self-ownership [justified by 1]
- Enact system property rights [justified by ??]
	- Presumption towards private ownership with the following constraints: Lockean Proviso, and Unilateral property acquisition
	- If no private ownership, presumption towards as localized ownership as possible
	- Not sure what justifies this. Can't be 1 because self-ownership doesn't pick a theory of property. Can't be 2 because 2 presupposes people are entitled to certain holdings (so it presupposes property rights).
- Commit trivial intrusions [justified by 2]
- Democracy and immigration restrictions are both results of common/collective property

Why interference doesn't have to be in retaliation to someone who initiated interference:
- See examples: property rights, trivial intrusions
- Based on the above examples, the real concern is effective liberty
- Imagine someone is about to fall on you. If you zap them, they will die and you will live. Otherwise, you will die and they will live. Do you have the right to zap them before they crush you? Yes. What if they are innocent? That changes nothing.
	- You might say that they inititated interference (even if they are innocent). Okay, replace the falling person with a falling anchor. You can zap the anchor, but it will kill a random stranger.

Detailed
- Consent: 
	- Explicit
	- Implicit
		- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
		- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
			- There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
			- Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
	- Revoked
		- E.g. to enforce contracts
- Impairment: 
	- Lack of rationality
	- Lack of information
	- Maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible
- Rectification: Compensation for constraints imposed
	- Past physical damages
	- Excess resource usage AND others attempt to access their fair share but are prevented
	- Mandated safety nets in societies where a person is worse-off due to the presence of a state or economic system.
	- Scope: worldwide
- Forced Compensation: taking someone's resources and compensating them, only if:
	- The portion taken is too small to cause large harm to the person's interests (e.g. in taxation)
	- The person is compensated for the transaction in the same resources
	- E.g. taxation to support welfare. If we didn't, we would have to pay for prisons, etc. Of course, this needs to be balanced against creating poor incentives for unfit reproduction.
- [Exception Rights] Protection against other constraints
	- Whether current or future (i.e. pre-emptive protection is justified).
	- This extends beyond mere requirements for a democratic society. It applies to constraints generally, even non-intentional and non-agential.
	- When considering whether to force A to assist B.
	- If A is causally responsible (either intentional or non-intentional, e.g. owning all water) for B's diminished liberty, the state is permitted to constrain A.
	- Otherwise, constraining A is permitted if:
		 - The cost to A is reasonable
		 - The burden alleviated from B is sigificant
		 - The only way to alleviate the constraint on B is by coercing A
		 - B is not responsible for his circumstances ?
	- Examples: 
		- Minarchism: police, military, courts, prison
		- Ambition-sensitive safety net: provide opportunity to food, healthcare, shelter, etc. The *ambition*-sensitive aspect is meant to create environments such that everyone can obtain food, healthcare, means for living, etc. *if* they have the appropriate intentions. This means providing the resources for children directly, and possibly for adults (for adults, it depends on the opportunities available in the economy).
- [Democracy 1] The preconditions for basic democracy don't require democratic support
	- Assuming they *did* have democratic support, we would still need these in place to know if they had democratic support.
	- The goal is to make sure everyone's interests are considered in the democracy. 
	- Examples
		- Voting Infrastructure
		- Courts
		- Education
			- Otherwise, people might not know they have the right to vote
			- They might not know what's good for them
			- They might be coerced non-violently by others 
- [Democracy 2] Arbitrary (non-contractual) communal preferences
	- Requires collective property?
	- Doesn't have to be based on contracts, and there need be no causal responsibility.
	- A community's preferences can trump other members' preferences assuming:
		1. There is widespread support. 
		2. The cost to the coerced is reasonable.
		3. The burden alleviated to the supporters is significant.
		4. The only way to alleviate the constraint is by coercion.
		5. The decisions could not feasibly be made on a more local level.
	- Restrictive immigration is permitted in a community so long as:
		- The internal group shares what exceeds their fare share of resources (e.g. via trade, aid, etc.).
		- The internal group has democratically decided to not let them in.
		- What if members outside of the group are oppressed, subjugated, etc. and we have not used more than our share? We have a duty to let in many so long as the cost is not too high (e.g. it doesn't degrade standard of living, increase crime, etc.) and/or donate aid, trade, etc. until it imposes a high burden. 
		- If the cost is too high, citizens are permitted to not let them in and the state should not make us let them in, but they are permitted to enter (e.g. a homeless person is permitted to break in one's home, but the homeowner has no obligation to let them in, and the state should not force them).
- [Contractual Externalities] Unwanted contractual Externalities
	- Justification
		- These are justified due to their contractual nature. Contracts only get their validity from consensual support.
		- It doesn't need to be the only way to alleviate a constraint.
		- Nor does the alleviated constraint need to be major.
	- Requirements:
		- Most people in a region prefer the opportunities to form contracts with features X
		- Most people are incentivized such that their actions in the market make it impossible for contracts of feature X to succeed
		- Thus, people's choices in a free makert are not expressions of their preferred contract system
		- People can express their contract preferences via voting
		- Note that the competing harms here are identical, e.g. people being restricted due to the free market versus the voting system.
		- Note that this applies to deciding how contracts are formed, not necessarily other preferred systems (e.g. this doesn't apply to whether people prefer gay people to be around). Why contracts?
			- (1) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, then contracts of type not-X would be disincentenvized from existing.
			- (2) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, this would not be an unjust restriction on employees/employers who prefer contracts of type not-X. 
			- (3) Whether an employer/employee is restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of free market versus forces of the political system does not influence the *personal harm* that this places on those employees/employers. Harm here is measured in their opportunity to satisfy their preferences.
			- (4) Whether a political/economic system is just supervenes on the harm it places on people.
			- (5) [1 and 2] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to free market actions, then this would not be an unjust restrictions on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
			- (6) [3 and 4] Whether people are restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of the free market versus the political system is not relevant to whether they are treated justly.
			- (7) [5 and 6] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to a voting system, then this would not be an unjust restriction on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
		- This does not work for things like wanting there to be no gay people because the 2nd permise wouldn't pass through. E.g. if everyone in a free makret acted to incentivize killing gay people, this WOULD be an unjust restriction on gay people.
	- Example: workplace benefits, regulations, etc. 
		- Most employees in a region would prefer mandated time off from their employers if they were fully informed, fully rational and had the power to unilaterally decide what kind of system to live in.
		- However, most employees are incentivized to go to companies that do not provide benefits because these companies tend to be more successful because they are more economically efficient.
		- What about the employees who prefer companies that do not provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by restricting their opportunities? 
			- It is the same restriction that one would feel if either they preferred a style of company that offerred benefits but the market didn't incentivize it. 
			- Thus, without these regulations, people who preferred these regulations would feel the same restrictions in the opposite direction. So the restrictions are equivalent and we should side with whatever is democratically decided. The only difference is one is decided by individuals via their choices in the market, and the other is decided by individuals via their voting preferences. The mechanism imposing the restriction is different, but the restriction *on the minority employers/employees* is identical.
			- It might be argued that the restrictions are different, because in a regulated system there will be *no* companies without these benefits. Whereas in a free system, there would still be *some* companies with those benefits, but people would be incentivized against going there so they would be less successful/frequent. Two responses: (1) the hypothetical was that the free system was such that there are *no* viable, successful companies with benefits in a free market. In which case, the restrictions would be equivalent. (2) if it is the case that there would be some viable successful companies with benefits in a free market but they would be a bit less efficient and so less frequent, then it is not just to force all companies to offer benefits. However, it is just to manipulate taxation such that companies with benefits are at no disadvantage. Assuming the only unwanted externality of the free market as that one's preferred company receives less income (i.e. assuming that's the only reason why people are individually incentivized to perpetuate a system that they don't want), then this will be sufficient regulation and no more is justified. 
		- Okay, employees are not forced any more than in a free market. What about the employers who do not want to provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by not even allowing them to open up their business?
			- See above. The same answers apply.
		- Basically, if it would be okay for a group of idealized (i.e. those concerned with the collective longterm wellbeing) individuals to force contracts of type-X through voluntary economic transactions, then it is also okay for a group of non-idealized individuals to force contracts of type-X through mandatory economic sanctions.
	- Similar examlpes:
		- Workplace benefits, regulations, etc.
		- Large business undercutting small businesses with low profit margins
		- Theft?
	- When local preferences does not match global preferences
		- I.e. when a person wants system X but they are individually incentivized to perform actions that lead to system Y, because their actions (in an unconstrained free market) only affect their individual benefits, rather than the system as a whole. 
		- Prisoner dillemma, e.g. a company's existence makes everyone's lives worse (e.g. automates all jobs) but no individual has the economic ability to outcompete it (because the larger company's products are all uncompetitively cheap) due to no individual having the incentive to purchase from a different company. 
		- ^ Similar justification as the argument for implementing private property over communally owned resources. E.g. avoids the tragedy of the commons. 

Principles of Justice (in decreasing order of lexical priority) - General principle is equality of opportunity/liberty, with lexical priority given to more important liberties/opportunities:
1. The state protects everyone's basic liberties. E.g. right to vote, freedom of movement/association/speech, private property, etc. protected by police, courts, borders, etc. The state also guarantees prerequisites for a functioning democratic society, e.g. education, childcare, etc. This imposes constraints on those who otherwise deliberately assault otherwise (minor constraints), those who would unintentionally limit the constraints of others, e.g. polluting companies (moderate constraints), and on taxpayers (minor constraints).
2. Disparities in opportunity to economic resources must not worsen anyone. Opportunity is meant in a strong sense here, i.e. A and B have equal opportunity iff A and B would have the same outcome if they had identical interests (as opposed to a weak sense of opportunity which merely requires that A and B have the same outcome if they had identical interests AND natural talents). Some notes on how this differs from the difference principle:
	- This principle has no concern with equal (weak or strong) opportunity to all offices and positions, unlike the first part of Rawls' second principle. As for the second part of the principle (the Difference Principle), there are two differences:  
	- This principle focuses on opportunity, rather than outcomes. It allows disparities in outcomes which are not the result of disparities in natural talents. E.g. there can be disparities in resources which are the result of different interests, which means they are not result of disparities of opportunity. Certainly, disparities in interests need not benefit the worse-off. 
	- This principle disallows disparities that worsen others, rather than disparities that do not benefit others. It allows disparities so long as they do not cause the poor (or anyone else) to be worse-off. The baseline for comparison is what a person's outcome would be if the better-off persons/group did not make themselves better off.
3. Other aspects of government control can be decided by democratic election (should principle 2 be included under here?).
	- The following conditions must be met:
		- The policy must be as decentralized as possible (prevent tyranny of the majority).
		- The policy must constrain certain citizen's behavior no more than how much other citizens would be constrained if the policy was not enacted. Economic policies fit well here.
		- An epistocratic system is fine: we can ban minors, felons, mentally handicapped, etc. from voting. The bans cannot be too widespread as it might lead to disenfranchisement. The precise line to draw must be settled empirically.
		- The state is the only way to alleviate such constraints OR the behavior that is constrained is legitimate only because of contractual support of citizens (e.g. think workplace or company regulations).
	- Voting on regulating economic resources (e.g. taxation)
		- Only allowed to account for cases where people are not incentivized to directly subsidize what they want. E.g. people want a museum, but people are not incentivized to provide initial funds (e.g. because startup costs are too high, there is little awareness of the museum initially, etc.).
	- Voting on regulating personal movement/behavior.
		- E.g. public nudity. 

			==================================================================
										Questions
			==================================================================

To think about:
- Individual permissions without state permissions, and vice-versa?
	- E.g. Enacting major constraints to alleviate major constraints
		- The state is not permitted to do this
		- Individuals are permitted to do this
		- Why? Some other reason, but it's not related to the arguments given thus far.
	- E.g. Can the state be selective in who it coerces (e.g. a certain racial group)?
		- Individuals can, but not a state. 
		- Why? States must be fair?
- Do exception rights support samariton laws? I.e. it should be illegal to let someone die.
	- Problem: my intuition against samariton laws plus 
	- Maybe. Only if the punishment is fines (comparable to taxation) instead of imprisonment. Otherwise the burden is too great.
	- I will not entertain questions about the difference between the burden of fines (which are backed by the threat of imprisonment) and imprisonment itself. 
- More extensive arbitrary communal preferences?
	- Problem: my belief about the justification restrictive immigration plus libertarian beliefs
	- Restrictive immigration already mentioned
	- Might there be more possibilities?
		- Having sex in public 
		- Anti-nudity laws
		- Anti- fraud/slander/libel laws
		- Anti- hard drugs laws (e.g. even when they don't result in a reduce material quality of life for non-drug users, but they result in more homeless/laze underclass population).
		- Suppressing free speech / freedom of association when it is needed to prevent oppression
		- Various economic/occupational regulations (other than redistribution)
		- Immigration restrictions
	- This may be possible if:
		- Certain laws are non-negotiable: e.g. police, courts, education, etc.
		- The constraints imposed are low.
		- The constraints alleviated are high.
		- The scope of the community is small.
		- There is ample land outside of this region.
	- Abstract away from the empirical limitations of migration:
		- Imagine persons in the original position. Every square mile of land is equally valuable. There is a lot of land. Everyone is allocated a square mile. They get to negotiation among each other about where to live and what kind of laws they want. Certain people move to the north where they ban X, others move to the south where they allow X but ban Y. Is this okay? It seems like it. But what if someone bans, e.g. public displays of affection? This seems okay if there are plenty of areas to choose in the original position that do not ban it, but what if everyone banned it?
	- How can cultural preferences justify force? I thought only opportunity to resources mattered? Perhaps, this is justified because the constrained members have opportunity outside of the community.
	- Perhaps on a global level, we guarantee equality of opportunity for groups. Within certain regions, we guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals.

### Formal Liberty

- Terminology
	- belief + desire = intention
	- ability (internal to agent) + opportunity (external to agent) = capacity 
	- intention + capacity = actualization
	- "constrained" = there is an interference
	- "coercion" = the interference is via another agent.
- Triadic relationship:
	- x is free iff x (an agent) has freedom from y (some interference) in achieving z (some goal).
	- Formal versus Effective freedom concerns which characterizations of y matter. Is an agent free simply if they lack interference from other external agents (formal freedom) or if they lack interference from other agents and non-agent inference, including interference from their lack of abilites or internal characteristics (effective freedom)?
	- A different way of characterizating the relationship:
		- x is free to z iff x (an agent) would achieve z if certain conditions C obtained. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), it is due to failing to meet some condition in C rather than some cause y (y is not in C). If x does not achieve z because of y, then x is not free.
		- Formal Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions, ability, lack of external interferences, etc. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free), this is due to some reason other than agent interference.
		- Maximal Effective Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), this is due to some reason other than some interference.
- What counts as x?:
	- Preference vs autonomy?
	- Freedom to do as one wants, or freedom to do as what one would want if they were rational?
	- E.g. rational self vs animal/empirical self
- What sources of interference y?:
	- Internal interferences, external interferences, other agent interferences?
	- Formal liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of agent intereference in seeking z
	- Effective liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of external/internal interference in seeking z
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities and historical intentions/abilities (i.e. he might not have the capacity to achieve z now, but he is free to z because would be have the capacity to achieve z if he had planned accordingly).
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities
		- [x] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions
			- i.e. people don't have a right to these things per se, e.g. food, water. So they can't justify coercing people just because they lack them. Rather they have the right to the opportunity to acquire these goods. E.g. if a person is in a situation where through no fault of their own they are unable to acquire food, they can coerce others to retrieve it. 
		- [ ] Directly providing z (A has z)
	- Qualiification to "intentions". I.e. "x is free to z iff x would z if he had the appropriate intentions and the intentions are of type T"?
		- Any intentions? E.g. We're all free to be successful authors because we would be successful authors if we had the appropriate intentions, e.g. adopted the intentions involved in writing certain words on a piece of paper. But clearly there's a sense in which some are free to be successful authors whereas others are not. 
		- Intentions that we know of. E.g. we're not free to be successful authors because we do not know which intentions to adopt to become successful, even though we would be successful if we adopted those intentions.
		- Intentions that we know of that are not coerced. E.g. if we would be killed if we did z (but there was no interference), then we are not free to do z. Less extremely, if there were severe penalties for doing z (e.g. social ostrasization) for doing z, then we are less free to do it.
		- Intentions devoid of any causal influence. E.g. libertarian free will. No.
- What constitutes "interference"?
	- At the very least, it must be something that plays a causal role in preventing an agent from actualizing an intention.
	- Physical obstacle?
	- Emotional distress?
	- Something in the middle?
		- Loud music, bright lights, etc. are harmful even though they are no more "physical" than disliked music, colors, etc. Why are they special?
		- Because they are harms that bypass an interpretative framework? 
		- Because they are of a higher quantity than other harms?
		- They restrict an agent's aims, independently of their intentions.
	- y is an interference for x achieving z if the following conditions are met:
		- y causes a state of affairs such that x cannot achieve z regardless of his intentions.
			- Too strong? What if y makes it such that x can only achieve z with rather costly intentions?
			- (avoid issues regarding the meaning "causation")
- What kind of z are people entitled to?
	- Any arbitrary aim? Property? Well-being? Suffering? Capacity for self-actualization?
	- Can't be any aim. E.g. you might have the aim that I not be homosexuals.
	- Can't be happiness.
	- Requires a qualitative ranking of what kinds of liberties matter.
	- Things that matters:
		- Basic Needs - food, water, shelter
		- Protection from assault, bodily autonomy
		- Property
		- Occupation?
	- This requires a qualitative, rather than merely quantitative, comparison of liberty tradeoffs. E.g. it might be the case that taxation reduces a rich person's liberty more than it promotes the liberty of a poor person. If you just enumerated all the activities that the rich person is prevented from doing and all the activities that the poor person can now do, it might be that more activities were reduced for the rich. However, this doesn't mean we can't limit the rich person's freedom. What matters is not just the amount of liberty, but the value of the liberty. The poor person is now free to perform more important activities (e.g. afford shelting, healthy food, etc.). Speaking of "overall liberty" when making these tradeoffs is a red herring.
- Function: how to respect liberty?
	- Simple Consequentialist? 
		- E.g. Maximize sum, maximize average, maximize worse-off, minimize number of people below a threshold? 
		- Maybe minimize number of people below a threshold, but no to the maximizing options.
	- Simple Deontologist? Never restrict or limit? 
		- E.g. Self-ownership, from which we extend property rights
		- No. Too strong. Leads to anarchism
	- Hierarchical Deontology? Possibly
		- Not consequentialist because:
			- People are permitted to harm others to save themselves, even if this makes a worse state of affairs. 
			- Our duties are not to aim towards some ideal state of affairs.
			- Agent-relative
			- Not aggregative
		- Create a ranked order of constraints on liberty, e.g. type 0, type 1, type 2, etc.
			- Type 0 are most important, e.g. constraints on life, movement, etc. (this does not include significant emotional harm, e.g. seeing what you perceive to be a sin, because there could be a norm whereby that harm is diminished). These are features that can limit a person independently of their intentions.
			- Type 0 violations are permitted to prevent other type 0 constraints
			- For all i, type i violations are permitted to prevent type j (where j< i) constraints
			- Constraints of different types are not commensurate
			- Type 0 = basic needs
			- Type 1 = bodily autonomy 
			- Type 2 = property
		- Threshold
			- Concerns what the state can do.
			- There is some base level threshold of freedom. The state is justified in enacting coercion M to group A in order to help group B, so long as (1) A is above the threshold, (2) B is below the threshold, (3) M does not leave individuals in A below the threshold, (4) M brings individuals in B above the threshold.
			- There might be multiple thresholds. Today, that threshold might involve something like public education, healthcare, police force, etc. Hypothetically, it could also involve saving people from torture. We might be able to force those in A to save those in B from being tortured, even if it subjects those in A to poor education, policing, etc. Or maybe there's a single threshold and if everyone is forced to be under it, there are no moral standards.
			- Insofar as the individuals in A are responsible for B being worse-off, they are obligated to assist in this.
			- Insofar as the individuals in B are not responsible, they are permitted to resist (even though the state is still justified to use force).
			- When coercion is permissible
				- If everyone is above the threshold, coercion is never permissible.
				- If everyone is below the threshold, and there's no way for an individual to get above the threshold without preventing someone else frmo going above it, then coercion is always permissible. There's just a conflict. Although it might be that justification and permissibility are concepts that don't really apply (e.g. in the state of nature).

### Disagreement

Broader laws are mandatory, non-negotiable. Local laws are decided democratically. Note also that the broader laws tend to be more libertarian whereas the local laws have the potential to be more authoritarian. In principle, the broader laws could be more authoritarian in different countries where there is homogenous culture where everyone agrees to some authoritarian rules. 

Perhaps, the ideal laws for a given region are simply the upshot of norms of the culture of that region. For homogenous societies, they are free to enforce whatever rules they prefer. However, when a region has a large diversity of opinion, then the range of acceptable laws narrows. The ideal laws for a region are the laws that it would be rational for that region to accept. However, if the views of a region are so diverse, then the only laws that it would be rational for a region to accept would be minimal libertarian laws that emphasized freedom and liberty. Laws regulating international affairs are the extreme of this: the only international laws there are are basic respect for the sovereignty of nations, protection from genocide, etc.

Coercive laws for members of group G are justified if and only if such laws would be approved of by fully informed and fully rational members of group G assuming they sought coercive laws to regulate behavior. A law is appropriate for group G only if it is the upshot of ideal social construction. When there is broad disagreement, the only laws that overlap with everyone's fully rational interest would be minimal libertarian laws.

Must explain the relationship between disagreement and ideal socially constructed norms in a way that explains:
1. That widespread disagreement implies that minarchism.
2. That minimal, but existent, disagreement does not imply minarchism.

### Against common libertarian arguments

#### Against NAP

So perhaps non-interference is a good foundation (instead of non-aggression).

Goals of a foundational libertarian principle:
- Ground ownership of the self
- Ground ownership of nonpersonal resources
	- Explains why we have the right to private property
	- Accounts for Lockean proviso
	- Accounts for unilateral property acquisition
- Ground reasonable delineation of ownership rights
	- Balance of claim-rights and liberty-rights
	- Minor Intrusions
	- Enforcement rights
- Ground other initiations of force
	- Against threats
	- Contract enforcement
	- Against fraud
	- Against defamation

Non-aggression cannot account for these features

----

Can non-interference account for the features?

Balance of claim-rights and liberty-rights (constraints on delineating property rights):
- Unilateral property acquisition
- Lockean proviso
- Enforcement rights
- Minor Intrusions
- Lifeboat scenarios

Permissible initiations of force (derivable from property rights)
- Against tresspassers
- Against those who would control our property
- Pre-emptive enforcement rights

Initiations of force (not related to property rights) [but can be considered interference in the broad sense]
- Against threats
- Against fraud
- Against defamation
- To enforce contracts

Initiations of force based purely on the interests of a group (not based on interference in the broad sense)
- E.g. outlaw nudity

Flow:
- Start off by outlining what people have the liberty-right to control, i.e. their bodies, unowned resources, etc.
- Then, state that they must also have the right to interfere with others who might interfere with the entities in their sovereignty.
- One way to do this is by granting them enforcement rights. These interfere with others who might interfere with you.
- Another way is by granting them claim-rights. These also (morally) interfere with others who might interfere with you.
	- Claim-rights can only be as large as enforcement rights?
	- E.g. if it's not permissible to use bodily coercion to inhibit a person from doing X (e.g. burn leaves, steal a loaf of bread), then it's not permissible to morally prohibit them from doing X?...Seems interesting.
	- Because, if you don't have the enforcement right to stop them from doing X, then that means the other person has the right to do X (since it would be wrong to stop them). But if they have the right to do X, then it cannot be that you have the claim-right against them doing X.
- Thus, people have liberty-rights, claim-rights, and enforcement-rights over given properties, which is enough to ground private property.

Many kinds of interference:
- Physical aggression (either impermissible or permissible - e.g. to stop someone else from an impermissible aggression).
- Rational interference (i.e. threatening someone)
- Property interference (the same as rational interference? since people cannot trust that they can form longterm plans?)
- Moral interference (i.e. claim-rights)

How to account for the seeming recipricol nature of interference
- E.g. imagine A is trying to do X, and then B stops them from doing X.
- Who initiated the interference?
- Well, that depends on X. If X involves manipulating B's body or B's property, then A initated interference. Otherwise B initiated interference.
- So must the theory of property rights be prior to the principle of non-interference? How can non-interference ground the theory of property rights, whe nproperty rights must be appealed to in order to determine whether something is interference?
	- A two-level theory for property rights and interference:
		- First, one must never interfere with anyone's property rights.
		- Second, property rights are determined based on what minimizes interference. Perhaps non-interference can justify the following principles: Lockean proviso and unilateral property acquisition. Note that non-interference must be the foundational principle rather than non-aggression because if non-aggression was the principle, then it would permit only *using*  (rather than *owning*) property (since *owning* introduces exclusion, which does not minimize aggression).
	- A more general two-level theory:
		- First, one can interfere with someone else, only if they have violated interference-minimizing laws
		- Interference-minimizing laws are the laws that minimize interference.
			- But not in a consequentialist sense. E.g. killing someone to save others does not minimize interference.
			- But rather in a deontological sense. 
				- E.g. It is permissible to exclude others (by *initiating* interference/aggression) from your fair share of resources, because the alternative imposes even more interference on your life (as others could always interfere with your projects).
				- In general, an agent is permitted to initiate interference iff doing so is necessary to avoid comparable/stronger interference on his own life.
	- The interference-minimizing two-level theory might work for extrapersonal property, but not self-ownership. 
		- E.g. the above seems to imply that A can take B's kidney if he needs it.
		- How do we show that B does not interfere with A when preventing A from taking the kidney?
		- Again, it seems like we need a prior theory of property rights.
		- Perhaps we need a baseline. We say that A interferes with B only if A prevents B from doing an action that he would have otherwise been able to do *according to some baseline*. What is the relevant baseline?
			- The world where A never prevented B from doing the action. That won't work because it implies that A interferes with B by stopping him from stealing the kidney (since B would have taken the kidney if not for A's action)
			- The world where A never existed. That might work. Remember, we are only trying to ground self-ownership. Obviously this would not work for property ownership.

-----

What is fundamental here?
- Non-interference? But sometimes interference is okay, e.g. to enforce property rights.
- Protecting property rights? Seems plausible. But it doesn't explain HOW to delineate ownership right.
- Enforcing contracts? Contracts only make sense after figuring out ownership rights.

How to formulate the theory?
- We cannot find general moral principles to determine everything. 
	- We must enumerate over some unit of analysis (e.g. possible action, object, law, etc.) on a case by case basis
	- And then ask who gets to decide the permissibility/enaction/etc. of the relevant unit
- Which unit of analysis? What question should we be asking? We must determine who gets to decide...
	- What objects people own? Too narrow? Because even if A owns X, we can ask what rights derive from this.
		- Perhaps we can have a two-level theory?
			- First, spell out what people own (first level of analysis = objects)
			- Second, spell out the exceptional cases where we can infinge on one's property (second level of analysis = acts).
	- What actions people get to do? Too narrow? Because even if A cannot do X, we can ask what punishments should there be.
	- What ways people get to control an object? Is this any diferent than the above?
	- What laws ought to be enacted, i.e. actions by the state.

Perhaps: construct a system of laws (or constitution) such that everyone's sovereignty is maximized? 
- A person has sovereignty over x iff:
	- He has a claim-right with respect to x (to prevent moral anarchy)
	- He has a liberty-right with respect to x (to prevent moral paralysis)
	- He has a reasonable opportunity with respect to x (to prevent fraud/threats)
		- E.g. if someone lies and says that a poisoinous product is healthy, you now to do not have a reasonable way to determine what to consume
- There are degrees of sovereignty.
	- People have near-maximum sovereignty in their self.
	- People have more sovereignty in their property.
	- People have less/shared sovereignty in resources that effect all equally
- E.g. Private property
	- Most aspects of control are determined privately. E.g. what music to listen to.
	- Some aspects are determined by a small group of people (e.g. neighborhood). E.g. how loud the music can be.
	- Some are determined by larger groups (e.g. the country, the world)
- E.g. Neighborhood property
	- Most aspects of control are determined by the members of the neighborhood
	- Some are determined by larger groups, e.g. the country, the world.

A law is permissible only if it promotes sovereignty
- Certain things are essential for sovereignty
	- Funding police to enforcement rights. Otherwise, some would have no effective claim-rights.
	- Funding ourts. Otherwise, there would be no way to adjudicate disputes, etc.
	- Outlawing fraud/threats. Otherwise, some would have no reasonable opportunities
	- Funding education. Otherwise, there would be no reasonable opportunity.
- Other things need to be trade-offs.
	- E.g. externalities from contracts
	- Arbitrary communal preferences.

Hierarchical Libertarian justifications:
- Principle of promoting sovereignty
- Derive property rights as the best way to promote sovereignty (given certain empirical facts about the world).
	- Determine what should be owned privately vs collectively
	- Determine what things are owned by which individuals/groups
- What can property rights be subverted

#### Against anarchism (based on the NAP)

1. Violating the NAP is a violation of rights
2. It is always morally wrong to violate rights
3. The state violates the NAP
4. Therefore, the state is morally impermissible

Premise 3 is true
- It takes property from others under the threat of force. 
- It regulates their behavior. 
- It maintains a monopoly on force, preventing others from exercising their rights to self-defense.

Premise 2 is unclear
- Can I violate your rights if it prevents 2 more serious rights violations against you in the future?
- E.g. can I push you if it would prevent you from getting hit by a truck? (perhaps this aren't rights violations because the victim would permit it).
- Or, can I make a minor intrusion on your property to cause massive benefits?
- E.g. tap you on the shoulder to save the worlds
- Or, can I make minor intrusions to prevent myself from being morally paralyzed?
- E.g. burn leaves in my yard even though smoke particles land in your yard?

Permise 1 is doubful - there are two readings of the Non-aggression principle
- Aggression = violation of someone's rights. Moralized conception.
	- This is circular.
- Aggression = an intrusion on someone's behavior. Non-moralized conception.
	- But anarchists prohibit acts which are not physical aggression E.g. tresppassing on someone's land, breach of contract, or fraud.
	- Anarchists permit initiations of physical aggression, i.e. when in defense of one's property. E.g. aggressing against tresspassed, breached a contract or committed fraud.
	- The NAP alone doesn't tell us what theory of property rights to accept (unless one said that one's possessions was their property). One's theory of property rights needs an independent justification and articulation. Indeed, a socialists can claim to uphold the NAP and adopt an egalitarian theory of property.
- The NAP is not a foundational value; it uses a moralized conception of aggression.

So reject premise 1 because:
- Even anarchist don't take NAP to be a foundational principle. 
	- If it's moralized then its not foundation. 
	- If its not moralized then its absurd.
- Rather, accept something like the "anti-paralysis" postulate. Don't specify rights in a way such that the claim-rights are so strong that they prohibit individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that those the rights were meant to protect, even when doing so imposes a minor constraint on others.
- Anarchists might not accept that because it ascribes to people rights to coerce others to avoid non-agent-caused constraints on their freedom (even though they should accept this given their other beliefs about our rights to e.g. property, protect against breach of fraud, etc. which involve coercing others to avoid non-agent-caused constraints on their freedom). Okay fine. But people do have a right to self-defense, to protect themselves to powerful gangs. They have the right to protect this right if the only way to reasonably do so is by imposing a minor constraints on others. This would be a moralized anti-paralysis postulate: Don't specify rights in a way such that the claim-rights are so strong that they prohibit individuals from protecting other rights that they have, even when doing so imposes a minor constraint on others. The "other rights" this refers to are the rights to protection from gangs.

Historical:
	- Anarchism has been destroyed at every point in history. Why assume an anarchist society could defend itself?
	- Maybe it won't.
		- Then this is pointless.

Logistical:
	- How do people defend themselves from assault?
	- Private defense agencies.
	- How is that different from a state?
	- (a) no monopoly, (b) no taxation, and (c) they follow the NAP
	- As for (b) and (c), why assume there would respect the NAP? History shows that people don't in general follow the NAP, so why assume they would under anarchism?
	- So we've established that these coorporations would not follow the NAP.
	- As for (a), (b) and (c): there could be a sole coorporation in a given area, either because they were the first or because they outcompeted everyone else. What's stop them from becoming a state? If there is competition, what's to stop a war from occuring between several defense agencies (e.g. over religion or whatever) leading to a victor.

#### Against Minarchism

Intuitive:
	- Is it justified to break someone's property to save someone from drowning if they were pushed in by someone else whom you cannot identify?
	- Yes, because you have to protect their negative rights.
	- But this violates the negative rights of the property owner.
	- This is okay, because we have a duty to protect the negative rights of others.
	- Shouldn't we also have a duty to protect the positive rights of others then?
	- No
	- What if someone is drowning not because someone pushed him but because of a gust of wind? Is this a relevant consideration?

What justifies using coercion to force others to support a state?

To protect the negative rights of others.

So people have a positive right to protection from violence

Against Nozick's minimum state
- We all have full and absolute rights to self-ownership and any property rights that follow from this. Whether a distribution is just depends on historical facts about how the distribution came to be, not end state facts about the current state of the distribution. If all property owned today came either via initial acquisition or free transfer, then the distribution is just, regardless of its inequality.
- (1) How to account for any just violations of liberty? Self-ownership implies full and absolute propety rights. How to account for positive rights to negative liberty (e.g. taxation)? Minor infringements on liberty to alleviate major constraints on others? Everyday behaviors that inevitably put others at risk (e.g. smoking causes pollution)? A theory of maximum equal baseline liberty can account for this. But a self-ownership argument to support this seems ad hoc, and may actually require appealing to maximum baseline liberty. 
- (2) How to account for property in the real world? Nozick states that we have rights to property because we have a right to our bodies, our labor and talents. Thus we have a right to any external resources we gain with the exercise of our talents/labor. But this is conditional on legitimate acquisition of those resources. We can own property by (1) appropriating unowned property contingent on the Lockean proviso, (2) being the recipient of a free transfer of property, or (3) being the recipient of legitimate rectification. The problem is almost none of the property owned today has been justly acquired since it's the result of war, subjugation, oppression, plunder, etc. and the idea of rectifying these unjustices in implausible. If we instead have a system of maximum equal baseline liberty, we can have a just system without dealing with going through history.

### Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

It has to do with justification of state coercion. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:
- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

It does not reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. 
- This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.
- It would not be immoral for A to steal from B if it required saving A's life, but B should the right to refuse.
- It would be immoral for B to stop A from getting B's money to save his life, but A should not have that right.
- The distinction is due to the difference between an individual being morally permitted to coerce someone, and the state being permitted to coerce someone. You can have individual permission without state permission, and vice-versa.
- E.g. individual permission without state permission: an individual can kill one person to save themselves. And perhaps an individual can kill one person to save another. But the state cannot kill one to save one. 
- This is because to do so would be to express priority of one person's life to another. The state is supposed to be impartial with regard to the value of its individual citizens. An individual has permission to give priority of his own life over others in situations where one must die, but not the state. The state is supposed to be an impartial judge that can be justified to all citizens.
- E.g. in the other direction: It is justified to tax the rich to fund the education of the poor, but the poor cannot steal from the rich to fund their own education. You might say: this is because of the negative effects of allowing the latter moral principle to govern society, i.e. we would be afraid of being robbed spontaneously, unlike the government which is transparent and predictable.
