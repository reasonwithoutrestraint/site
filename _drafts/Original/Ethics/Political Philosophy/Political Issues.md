### Justified coercion by region

Global
- Basically anarchism.
- Respect for the sovereignty of other countries.

Diverse community (e.g. U.S.). All above plus
- Minarchism
- Military
- Courts for federal laws
- Police to enforce federal laws
- Food/drug regulation
- Compensation for monopolies
	- Redistribution
- Compensation for societal disadvantage
	- Safety nets: low cognitive functioning, disability, unemployment
	- Anti-discrimination laws
Homogeneous community (e.g. US state/city or European countries). Any of these could be valued (could even be minarchist). All above plus

### By Contemporary Politics

Left-Leaning:

- Abortion
    - No restrictions
- Criminal justice
    - Rehabilitation and safety
    - Decriminalize drugs, don't legalize
	- Not retribution. Consider the cases:
		- Agent is morally evil but no longer a threat.
			- Has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed (not rehabilitated). He experiences no suffering. Should we still inflict harm?
		- Agent is a threat but not morally good. 
			- He should be rehabilitated, expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed. Doesn't matter whether this is due to moral corruption or uncontrollable circumstances.
		- Agent is neither morally bad or a threat.
			- Has been rehabilitated.
		- We can agree that if an agent has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed, then we shouldn't inflict suffering. Why is this not also true if he's been rehabilitated.
- Gay marriage
    - Government shouldn't be involved in marriage.
    - If they are, then it should not discriminate based on sex.
- Subsidized Loans
    - Only awarded to those likely to repay them (based on e.g. test scores, grades, etc.)
    - Only have to be paid off after acquiring a certain income level
- Subsidized Healthcare
    - Maybe, if its effective.

Right-Leaning:
- Immigration
    - We have the right to any restrictions
    - We should filter in-demand immigrants that can't be filled by natives
    - I desire low influx of immigrants
- Decentralization
- Free Speech
	- Hate Speech allowed
	- Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Nazi Germany)
- Freedom of Association
	- Including discrimination
    - Not inherently wrong
    - Wrong if its arbitrary and exclusionary (rather than balancing)
    - Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Racist USA)
- Affirmative Action
    - Ineffective insofar as it admits students of low standards
    - Don't care otherwise
- Welfare 
    - Provide a means of living for the poor
    - Maybe enough for a limited number of children
    - Don't incentivize unlimited reproduction for the unfit

Other:

- Gun Control
	- Don't care
- Education 
    - Make impractical subjects optional
    - Less encouragement for college
    - Add practical skills
    - Add values.

Very Important:
- Abortion
- Immigration
- Welfare
- Free Speech
- Freedom of Association
- Rehabalitive Justice
