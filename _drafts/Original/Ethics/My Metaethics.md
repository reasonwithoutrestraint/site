## Normative Truth

`Questions`

1. What does it take for a statement or judgment to be truth-apt?
2. What are the standards of correctness for normative statements/judgments?

Forms of truth:

- General: Judgment S expresses state of mind M. S is _ if and only if M is _. 
- Descriptive Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal Judgments:
- Probabilistic Judgments:
- Causal Judgments:

Normative Judgments

- Epistemic Normativity: 
- Prudential Normativity: 
- Moral Normativity: 

Ways for accounting for normative truth in a non-descriptivist sense:

- Existence Internalism: 
    - Judgment Internalism: A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Existence Internalism: X is a normative reason for A iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational/informed deliberation.
	- Normative reasons are the output of correct deliberation from one's motivational reasons.
- Possible conceptions:
    - Constructivism/Constitutivism: 
        - The truth of a normative judgment is contextualized to the truth of other normative jugdments an agent makes.
    - Dispositionalism
        - Same truth conditions as constructivism, but now with the existence of descriptive normative entities. 
        - Normative reasons are naturalistic entities posited to explain our informed, rational attitudes (motivating reasons explain actual attitudes).
        - Analogy: naturalistic non-normative entities posited to explain our idealized perceptions.

The naturalists, constructivists no-descriptivists need not disagree here about the truth conditions. They all agree that the truth of a normative judgment consists in it being rationally derivable.

Quasi-truth-apt: Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.

## Normative Domains

`Questions`

1. What are the constituent features of rational deliberation?
1. What are the constituent features of epistemic norms, prudence, morality, etc?
2. Is morality rationally necessary?

Normativity/rationality generally:

- Capacities of agents as such:
    - Form beliefs - have a mind-to-world state of mind.
    - Perform intentional actions - have a world-to-mind state of mind.
- Requirements on normative thinking:
    - Consistency - Insofar as one believes a moral proposition (or any proposition), they cannot believe its negation.
    - Explanatory - Beliefs shouldn't just be unrelated consistent propositions; some propositions should explain the others. If our normative judgments where radically contextualized to particular times, places, circumstances, etc. then we could never make plans for the future.
    - Supervenience: The purpose of normative reasoning is to plan responses to circumstances in the future. No such plan can be useful if it gives different responses for the same circumstances.  

Reasons = judgments that would be formed following exercise of the above capacities with full respect to the above requirements, conditioned on any judgments which are constitutive of the normative domain in question.

Epistemic reasons

- Reason to follow principles of deduction: Insofar as one believes P and believes P->Q, why do they have necessary reason to believe Q? It cannot be because Q is true. There are plenty of true statements that we don't have reason to believe, also Q need not be true if either P or P->Q are false.
- Reason to accord beliefs to perception: Insofar as one perceives entity X with properties P, why do they have necessary reason to believe that X exists with certain properties? Insofar as one perceives a entity with certain properties, there is a tendency to believe that entity exists with those properties. If someone witnessed certain sensation without also having corresponding dispositions of beliefs that they mapped to reality, then they would be perceptions.

Prudential reasons

- Reason to satisfy ends: insofar as one values end X, why do they have necessary reason to act to bring about X? Insofar as one performs an intentional or voluntary action, it is done with the intention to bring about some end, i.e. it is done because one believes they have reason to perform it. Otherwise, it would be a nonvoluntary action.
- Reason to apply means-ends reasoning: Insofar as one take themselves to have reason to promote X, why do they have necessary reason to promote Y given that Y promotes X? Part of what it is to take oneself to have reason to promote X is to take oneself to have reason to perform the means to promote it. If one didn't take oneself to have reason to promote those means, they wouldn't think they have reason to promote X.
- Desires/motivations: Desires and motivations are not the same as values and reasons. 
    - For one, one can desire X or be motivated to bring about X without valuing X or judging that they have reson to bring about X.
    - Desires and motivations are not subject to the constitutive features of normative judgments. E.g. it doesn't follow from the mere fact that one desires X that they have reason to bring about X. It is not constitutive of desiring X that one also desires the means to bring about X (e.g. if X is have healthy teeth and the means is performing a painful dental operation)
    - Judgments of value and judgments of reasons do bear an interesting relationship to desires and motivations. It may be that normative judgments are the product of motivational features plus the following features: endorsement, reflection/deliberation, full consciousness/awareness, full information 

Moral reasons

- Taking into account the interests of others: insofar as one advances a moral judgment X, why do they have necessary reason to take into account the interests of others? Insofar as one advances a moral judgment, they are making an attempt to modify the behaviors and attitudes of others. If a person has no interest in modifying the judgments of others, they are not playing the morality game. To play the morality game well, the moral judgments that they advance must be judgments that others would accept if they were fully rational, i.e. they would need to advocate for moral norms that all persons have reason to respect.

What does it mean to say that certain rules are constitutive of a normative domain? It is not to say that people are incapable of violating that rule within that domain. Clearly people make normative errors. Rather, it is to say that people are incapable of violating that rule in full consciousness and awareness of what they are doing. For example, people can clearly hold contradictory beliefs. But they cannot hold those contradictory beliefs while in full consciousness and awareness of the implications of those beliefs. This can explain the motivation of normative judgments. A normative judgment is true for an agent if and only if the agent would hold that judgment in full consciousness (or some other circumstances), and valuing full consciousness (or those other circumstances) just is what it is to be a rational creature. For example, we are incapable of believing P and not P. This explains why it is irrational to believe propositions with contradictory implications, because if we were in full consciousness, we would/could not hold those beliefs.
