Unintended pregnancies and family structure
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232137/
"Births resulting from unintended pregnancies are often conceived out of wedlock and the infants are born to unmarried women. More than 40 percent of infants born after unintended conception begin life with unmarried parents. Births to unmarried parents are twice as likely to be unintended as births to married parents (70.4 compared with 33.9 percent) (Kost et al., 1994). Moreover, couples who marry after conception—usually unintended—are more likely to divorce than couples who marry before conception (Bumpass and Sweet, 1989). Finally, unintended pregnancies within marriage are associated with a greater risk of divorce after the child's birth. For all these reasons, children born after unintended conceptions are very likely to live apart from one or both of their parents, usually their father, sometime during childhood."

Family structure and SES
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232137/
"Finally, children who live with only one parent have more problems finding and keeping a steady job after leaving school and are more likely to have encounters with the criminal justice system than children who live with both parents (Haveman and Wolfe, 1994; McLanahan and Sandefur, 1994; Powers, 1994). As noted above, these differences persist even after adjusting for differences in the parents' socioeconomic background."

"Compared with children from the same social class background who grow up with both biological parents, children raised by only one parent, usually the mother, are more likely to drop out of high school, less likely to attend college, and less likely to graduate from college if they ever attend"
