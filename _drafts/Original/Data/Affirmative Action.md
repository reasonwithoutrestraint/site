## Predictive power of SATs

Problems with affirmative action
1. Mismatches students, causing failure
2. Builds resentment
3. Furthers the political climate where certain special groups feel they are entitled to benefits
4. Rationalizes stereotypes among graduates: see test scores for lawyers, doctors, etc.
