Blacks save less even with the same income

[Borgo (2013)](http://www.iza.org/conference_files/SUMS_2013/dal_borgo_m5011.pdf) looked at data on 25,820 American households and found that Black homes had lower savings rates than White homes even after controlling for differences in income, age, family size, education, region of residence, and marriage. Normally, using savings rates as a measure of self-control would be problematic because it is obviously easier to save money if you have a large income, but this study utilized an impressive set of controls and so can be taken as a valid measure of self-control.

* [Castillo, Ferraro, Jordan, and Petrie 2011](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/06/11/racial-differences-in-self-control/Castillo,%20Ferraro,%20Jordan,%20and%20Petrie%20(2011)) had a sample consisting of 82% of the student population of 4 middle schools in a poor Georgia school district. They ran an experiment to measure self-control among black and white students. They say “In our experiment, subjects are asked, orally and in writing, to make twenty decisions in total. For each decision, subjects are asked if they would prefer $49 one month from now or $49+$X seven months from now. The amount of money, $X, is strictly positive and increases over the twenty decisions.” Using this design, they were able to measure at what point people began to prefer the later reward and, thus, the strength of their preference for immediate gratification. Blacks were found to have significantly less self-control than Whites.
* [Wany, Rieger, and Hens (2011)](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1481443) utilized a sample of 5,291 university students from 45 countries and gave participants a chance to choose an immediate monetary reward or a larger long term reward. The chart below shows the proportion of people from different regions that chose the larger and less immediate reward.

* [Moffitt et al. 2010](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/7/2693.full.pdf) has shown that low self-control predicts criminality and poverty even after controlling for IQ and parental socio-economic status. We also know that blacks and whites have different levels of self-control. There have been studies that haeve demonstrated deficiencies in self-control among children and adults, with in the United States and in other countries.
