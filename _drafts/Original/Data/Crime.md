Homicide rate by state

"Disparities in troublesome behavior between Blacks and Whites appear far before adulthood. Among middle schoolers, for example, Black males have suspension rates three times higher than White males, and Black females have suspension rates over four times higher than White females. We even see disparities in disruptive behavior among preschool aged children. Despite making up make up 18% of enrolled preschoolers, Black children account for 48% of preschool children suspended more than once."

"For instance, one report from the US Department of Education found that Black preschoolers are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than white preschoolers and Black students are 2.3 times more likely than white students to be referred to law enforcement or arrested as a result of a school incident."

"Black girls account for 20% of all female preschoolers and 54% of female preschoolers, who are suspended more than once. Black preschool children as a whole were found to be 3.6 times more likely than Whites to be suspended. Looking at all grades, Blacks were roughly 4 times as likely as Whites to be suspended and twice as likely to be expelled."

"Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature."

"These findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued."

"Accordingly, large populations of African Americans are said to be characterized by cultural values that promote violence independent of structural factors such as poverty" (page 81)

"Messner (1982a) studied 204 SMSAs for 1970. Contrary to the research of Loftin, Hill, Parker and Smith, Messner showed that poverty was negatively related to homicide rates, and in an important departure from the twol previous studies, he found that the Gini coefficient was not related to homicide. More surprisingly, Messner showed that the South was strongly related to homicide rates and that percentage black was the strongest determinant" (page 82)

"Messner (1983a,b) buttressed these results with two additional studies. In the first, Messner sought to replicate the earlier study of Loftin and Hill (1974). He constructed a similar poverty index and controlled for all relevant variables. Again he showed strong support for South and per cent black in determining homicide rates and no support for Gini." (page 82)

"In the second paper, Messner (1983b) focused on 256 nonsouthern and 91 southern cities in separate samples for 1970. He showed that poverty was only related to homicide rates in the sample of non-southern cities, and that again Gini failed to predict homicide in either region. He also contradicted his previous paper by showing that per cent black wasjust as strongly related to homicide in the South as it was in the rest of the country" (page 83)

"Bailey argued that the city is a better unit of analysis because there is less variation in crime rates across cities. With 153,73 and 137 cities for 1970,1960 and 1950 respectively, Bailey presented results that generally support the poverty thesis. But contrary to Carroll and Jackson's (1983) study, which was also based on cities, Bailey found that economic inequality (Gini) was not related to homicide. South was also unrelated, but per cent black was a strong predictor."

This is why when we look at places like Kentucky, home to a population that has the second highest white poverty rate in the nation (yet a violent crime rate that is 40 percent lower than the national average)

http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/13-states-with-the-highest-white-excluding-hispanics-and-latinos-poverty-495/

Appalachia is almost entirely white and the poorest region in the country. We see horrible rates of poverty, yet the crime that plagues Detroit, Norfolk, Richmond, Baltimore, St. Louis, Atlanta, Memphis isn't found.

The 10 U.S. counties with the lowest annual median household incomes are:

1.Owsley County, Ky. – $21,177

2.Zavala County, Texas – $21,843

3.Clay County, Ky. – $22,255

4.Knox County, Ky. -$22,493

5.Wilcox County, Ala. – $22,611

6.Quitman County, Miss. – $22,625

7.Sumter County, Ala. – $22,857

8.McCreary County, Ky. – $23,163

----- IQ -----

73% of the incarceration disparities is erased when we fix to persons with average IQ. For 29-year-olds, 13% of Blacks had ever been interviewed in a correctional facility (a proxy for incarceration), compared to 2% of Whites. For persons of average IQ (100), the number drops to 5% for Blacks and 2% for Whites (page 338 of The Bell Curve).

Gottfredson (1998) observes that youths with IQ of 75–90 are seven times more likely to be incarcerated than those with IQ of 110–125, and states: ‘‘no other trait or circumstance yet studied is so deeply implicated in the nexus of bad social outcomes’’ as low IQ.
