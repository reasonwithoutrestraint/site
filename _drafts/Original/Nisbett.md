From Nisbett, *Intelligence and how to get it*

- as of about 1980 black females were twice as likely to have an IQ above 120 than were black males. There is of course no conceivable genetic explanation for such gender differences, given that there is no mean difference in IQ between white males and females and given that, for whites, males are more represented at the high end of the IQ distribution
- A difference between black and white brain size is not always found , however (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1978) . More important, the correlation found within the white population probably does no t indicate that greater brain size causes higher IQ . Within a given family , the sibling with the larger brain has no higher IQ on average than the sibling with the smaller brain (Schoenemann , Budinger, Sarich, and Wang , 1999)
- The male/female differences in cranial capacity are substantially larger than the black/white differences (Ankney, 1992.). Yet the two genders have the same average IQ . 
- One large sample of blacks shows that the cranial capacity of black females was the same as that of whites, yet the IQ difference was the usual standard deviation typical of the gap at the time the data were collected (Joiner, in press). The IQ difference therefore is found in the absence of a cranial-capacity difference - Finally , it is likey that the brain-size differences between blacks and whites that are sometimes found are environmental rather than genetic in origin (Ho, Roessmann, Hause, and Monroe, 1981). Pregnant black women are more likely to have any number of conditions that can result in smaller size of both body and brain, ranging from poor nutrition to alcohol use, than are white women. Perinatal factors are also much more negative fo  blacks in general than for whites (Bakalar, 2.007); and prematurity is associated with much lower brain size, especially for black babies (Ho et al., 1981)

- Achievement beyond IQ
	- Some Black/white cultural Differences
	- Asian overachievement
	- Jewish overachievement
	- Black overachievement (among high-IQ scorers) 
	- Black underachievement (among low-IQ scorers)

- Systemic Racism
-- Include the following comments on college admissions
-- Review black representation (benchmarked against demographics and qualifications) in media/entertainment

Look up systemic racism and college admissions in America's Ivy Leagues
- Get demographics: Jewish whites, Asians, gentile whites, Blacks, Hispanics, etc.
- Compare chances of being admitted conditional on test scores and grades.
- Compare overall probability of attending Ivy Leagues between gentile whites and Blacks

Prooblems:
- If we are benchmarking against demographics, non-Jewish whites are underrepresented
- If we are benchmarking against qualified applicants, non-Jewish whites are underrepresented
- If we believe that underrepresentation of certain groups (e.g. blacks) is evidence of systemic racism but not for non-Jewish whites, then this is itself an instance of racism (regardless of whether underrepresentation is itself an instance of systemic racism).
- If we believe that underrepresentation of certain groups (e.g. blacks) is a _problem_ (regardless of whether its evidence of systemic racism; e.g. even if its due to a cultural problem) but not for non-Jewish whites, then this is an instance of racism (one because we don't care about problems for non-Jewish whites, and two because by not even acknowledging it as a problem, we are blind to the problem which leaves us unable to discover solutions).

Harvard 
- 30% Jewish
- 20% Asian
- 20% Other (Hispanic, Native American, Mixed, Other)
- Remaining 30%:
	- If blacks are >= 8% (making whites <= 22%),
	- Then a black person is more likely to attend Harvard than a non-Jewish white person.
