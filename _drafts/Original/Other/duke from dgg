He beleives "self-awareness" = "consciousness"

Thinks this is analytically true:

Can make two possible arguments:

1. He's describing the way we currently use the word.
2. He's not trying to describe the way we use the word. He's just using his own idiosyncratic definition.

If (1), he is clearly false.

* Self-awareness = awareness of self
* Conciousness = awareness of a set of things, where that set of things does not include the self

"awareness" is not meant as mere perception/knowledge, but the same kind of awareness that we ordinary have.

Imagine someone is aware of a rock, chair, ball, their self, etc. Now subtract their awareness of the self.

Is this a contradiction.

If (2), no one cares. He's not even making an interesting claim.

-> He can't use this to show that babies don't have consciousness/self-awareness using the mirror test. Because the mirror test only shows that babies lack the ordinary conception of self-awareness. They are not using it to show that babies lack duke's conception of self-awareness.

He tries to compare his argument to the cogito. But there are differences:
* "I think. Therefore, I am" is not an analytic truth. That statement is not true by virtue of the meaning of the words. It's true by virtue of the fact that I'm alive.
* The argument for "I think" is by virtue of the fact that it cannot be doubted. It has nothing to do with language.
