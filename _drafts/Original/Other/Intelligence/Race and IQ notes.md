Cottrell (2013). "Explaining the black-white gap in cognitive test scores: toward a theoretical model of adverse impact"
- 75% of the BW gap is eliminated when controlling for maternal cognitive ability, maternal sensitivity, birth order, and learning materials in the home. Over 80% becomes explained after considering other variables.

Yeung and Conley (2007). "Black‚ÄêWhite Achievement Gap and Family Wealth"
- the BW gap was no longer statistically reliable after controlling for family and home characteristics. 
- Wealth is measured not in terms of overall holdings, but in terms of liquid assets, property, etc. This implies that wealth transfers do not explain BW differences, but parental differences in their ability to generate wealth does expain a lot of BW differences.

Rothstein and Wozny (2012). "Permanent Income and the Black-White Test Score Gap"
- "When we add permanent income to the controls used by Fryer and Levitt (2006), the unexplained gap in 3rd grade shrinks below 0.15 SDs, less than half of what is found with their controls."
