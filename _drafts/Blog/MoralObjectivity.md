## What we don't desire

1. Ontological objectivity
2. Non-axiomatic/circular explanation of moral truths
3. Unquestioning persuasion/motivation
4. Non-axiomatic/circular evidence for moral truths
5. Reasons internalism - "reasons" is a fundamentally relational term

## What we desire

A METHOD for everyone who makes moral judgments

A procedure that all could see as having legitimacy

A method for resolving disputes -> that's determined by normative ethics


## Arguments from error theory

June 15th, 2020

What is needed by internalism:
- Draw some connection between motivation and some kind of normative (either some kind of judgment about reasons or awareness of facts that happen to be reasons). Otherwise, what is the connection between motivation and normative requirements?.
- Constrain the relevant motivations to normative judgments themselves. Because motivations which are not normatively endorsed cannot (rationally) motivate behavior.
- Now there are two kinds of arguments for existence internalism:
	- Judgment internalism implies existence internalism. This is false. See "Motivation Argument" below. 
	- Normative requirements are restricted to one's normative judgments. This is false, even according to internalists. See "Modified motivation" below

What the error theorists wants to do is show:
1. Instrumental reasons are in some way more normative/binding than moral reasons
2. Morality purports to provide the most normative/binding reasons

Perhaps:
- Moral agents are a subset of rational agents. Thus, norms for rationality are more binding/normative than norms for morality.
- Morality purports to provide the most binding/normative reasons, which extends to norms for rationality (in the sense expressed in the previous bullet, where moral agents are a subset of rational agents). 
	-> This isn't true. Morality is meant to make agents be instrumentally suboptimal.

Basic internalism argument against morality

1. All reasons are internal (internalism)
2. Moral claims purport to provide categorical reasons
3. Categorical reasons are not internal
4. Therefore, moral claims are all false

Rebuttal: internalism clearly is false:
- If it's a conceptual, then it's question-begging against moral reasons (since moral reasons are conceptually categorical).
- If it's substantive, then it fails since our intuitions about moral reasons are stronger than our intuitions about internalism

Rationality

1. The only norms of rationality is to adopt the means to fulfill one's ends
2. Moral claims purport to provide categorical norms for rationality
3. Therefore, moral claims are all false

Rebuttal: either (1) or (2) is false
- If "rationality" just means "instrumental rationality", then (2) is false. The very purpose of morality is to be instrumentally suboptimal.
- If "rationality" means "moral rationality", then (1) is false.

Also, what is an "end"?
- if "end" = "motivation", then this is clearly false. It is not irrational to reject one's motivations.
- "if "end" = "values" (i.e. what one takes oneself to have reason to do), then this might be true.

* The crucial argument. The internalism argument only works by drawing some strong connection between motivation and reasons judgments/awareness.

Motivation Argument

1. All reasons must be motivating if one is aware of them
2. Moral claims purport to provide categorical reasons
3. Categorical reasons cannot be motivating
4. Therefore, moral claims are all false

Rebuttal:
- if "motivating" means "overriding motivating", then (1) is false.
- if "motivating" means "instrinsically motivating for all beings", then (1) is false.
- if "motivating" means "instrinsically motivating for all rational beings", then (3) is false. 
	- Return to the rationality argument.
	- One might say if you require the agent to be "morally rational" in order to be motivated by a moral reason, then the moral reason isn't intrinsically motivating.
	- But the same requirement applies to be motivated by an instrumental reason. One needs to be instrumentally rational to be motivated by an instrumental reason.
	- In fact, there are two requirements for the motivation (assuming the motivation is rational):
		(a) the agent needs to recognize that they have reason to adopt the end in question. E.g.
			- Without this recognition, the agent can't be (rationally) motivated to pursue the end in question. If the agent was motivated to pursue the end, it wouldn't be a rational motivation (e.g. it would be an addiction).
			- Note that there are no requirements that the end in question relate to an agent's antecedent motivations. Thus, whatever end the agent recognizes that they have reason to adopt (whether an instrumental or moral reason) can be instrinsically motivating to them insofar as they are instrumentally rational. This normative recognition itself can motivate, independently of the contents of the end.
		(b) the agent needs to be instrumentally rational, i.e. motivated to adopt the ends that they take themselves to have reason to adopt.

Modified Motivation Argument

Thus, (1) from above should be modified. It is not that agent's awareness of R (where R happens to be a reason) must motivate the agent. Rather, the requirement is that the agent's awareness of R, where they judge R to be a reason, must motivate the agent. In other words, if an agent judges that they have reason to X, then that should (rationally) motivate them to X. 

In other words, in order for internalism to work, the relevant motivations must be limited to normative judgments and not any random motivation. So the argument can be changed to this:

1. If normative judgments should be intrinsically motivating for an agent.
2. Morality provides normative requirements that are independent of their normative judgments.
3. An agent's normative requirements are restricted to their normative judgments.
4. Therefore, all moral claims are false.

(3) is false.
- Consider instrumental reasons. What if someone fails to recognize R as a reason because they are ignorant, but they would recognize R as a reason if they were fully informed?
- Rebuttal: but we can derive from the agent's normative judgments that R is a reason for them, because they take themselves to have reason to value their hypothetical normative judgments under full information.
	- Right, but how do we weigh that normative judgment (their value of their hypothetical fully informed normative judgments) above conflicting normative judgments (that they have normative reason S which conflicts with their value of their hypothetical fully informed normative judgments).
	- Also, what if they don't currently value their hypothetical fully informed normative judgments?
- The response is to posit judgment-independent normative standards, i.e. to value what you would value if you were fully informed (even if you don't currently care about this).

Now, there is a distinction that can be made between "subjective" (accessible) reasons and "objective" (available) reasons. Further, I will even concede that subjective reasons are more "foundational" than objective reasons, since I would say all objective reasons are the subjective reasons that a person would have under full information. However, note that objective reasons might not be derivable from someone's motivations (e.g. they might not care about their hyothetical selves under full information). Does this make objective reasons less normative than subjective reasons? Of course not. Likewise, there's no reason to believe moral reasons are any less normative.

Two ways that subjective reasons are foundational:
- We NEED to have a theory of subjective reasons, since we don't always have the relevant facts.
- Objective reasons are based on them

This gives some credence to the force of internalism. Because all subjective reasons are internal. And all other reasons are based on subjective reasons.

Now, one could argue that an objective reason wouldn't really be a reason if the agent didn't care about their hypothetical fully informed normative judgments. If that's the case, then I have no problem conceding that moral reasons aren't really normative. The fact of the matter is that we expect agents to be concerned with justifying themselves to others, just as we expect agents to care about the normative judgments of their fully informed selves.
