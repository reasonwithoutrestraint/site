## Why systemic explanations fail

Why would blacks/Hispanics be picked out as losers but not Asians?

We see similar disparities among groups of the same race
- Russians vs Italian
- East Asian vs South Asian
- Black natives vs immigrant blacks 

Blacks do as well as whites after controlling for IQ

Compare those groups in other countries
- Whites/Asians/Jews succeed everywhere
- Asians succeed even when disadvantaged
- Blacks fail consistently
