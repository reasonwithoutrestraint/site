### Intelligence

* [Peoples et al. (1994)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016028969590039X) found an IQ gap of one standard deviation between black and white children at just 3 years of age after controlling for age, gender, birth order, and maternal education.

In general, mean IQs are highest among the Asians and decline successively among whites, Hispanics and blacks. The details of the data for the four abilities for the four groups are given and provide a number of interesting results.

The premise of the present article is that, while the one standard deviation IQ difference between Black and White adults has remained constant, IQ differences between Black and White children are declining. These data are discussed in the context of previous studies on possible racial bias of IQ tests, as well as marked changes in educational and economic opportunities that have occurred in the United States in the decades since Jensen’s (1969) article. 

### Achievement

There have been plenty of studies documenting the early achievement gap between blacks and whites:

* [Farkas and Beron (2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222077713_The_Detailed_Age_Trajectory_of_Oral_Vocabulary_Knowledge_Differences_by_Class_and_Race) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200408081138/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222077713_The_Detailed_Age_Trajectory_of_Oral_Vocabulary_Knowledge_Differences_by_Class_and_Race)] investigated oral vocabulary (PPVT) scores for black and white children by age. They found (page 477) that “Beginning with the earliest observation at 36 months of age, Whites average significantly higher scores than African-Americans. This pattern is consistent over the full age span, with the White lead remaining significant through 13 years of age. To see how very substantial this vocabulary gap is, note that Whites cross the 40-word level at approximately 50 months of age, whereas African-Americans do not reach this level until approximately 63 months, which puts them 13 months, or more than one year, behind in vocabulary development.” The PPVT is a commonly used measure of intelligence (e.g., see meta-analysis by [Protzko 2015](https://teknologipartiet.dk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/The-environment-in-raising-early-intelligence-A-meta-analysis-of-the-fadeout-effect.pdf) [table 1]).
* [Phillips et al. (1998)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-06583-006) report that the black-white standardized gap in academic achievement does not change much between first and twelfth grade. The reading gap does not change at all, and the math and vocabulary gaps widen by only 0.2 standard deviations. They conclude that about half the racial educational gaps can be attributed to black-white differences in ability _prior_ to entering school. The other half can be attributed to the fact that blacks learn less than whites _after_ entering school. Differences in school quality and differences in socioeconomic status – which includes region, urbanism, family composition, household size, parental education, occupational category, and income – do not explain why blacks learn less than whites of similar pre-school ability (page 256).
* https://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327930pje7902_5 Achievement gap at age 9 = 0.8 SDs. Very little change between 1970 and 1990

Finally, consider the [Early Childhood Longitudinal Study](https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/) (ECLS), which is a program sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The program includes 4 longitudinal studies that examine children’s knowledge, skills, and socioemotional development from throughout elementary school. One particularly interesting study, the [ECLS-B](https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/birth.asp), provides information on cognitive and motor skills at 9 months, 2 years, and 4 years of age across a nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in the U.S. in 2001. This information is disaggregated by race and published on their [official website](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables_2.asp#Ch2Sub20). The results are as follows: 

* At [about 9 months of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.10.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905225249/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.10.asp)], white children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, a greater percentage of white children demonstrated ability to explore objects with a purpose (84.0% vs 80.8%), proficiency in communication through diverse nonverbal sounds and gestures (30.4% vs 27.8%), and proficiency in engaging in early problem solving (3.9% vs 3.3%). In contrast, black children outperformed white children on every measure of motor skill. For example, compared to white children, a greater percentage of black children demonstrated proficiency in being able to use visual tracking to guide hand movements to pick up a small object (91% vs 88.8%), proficiency in ability to engage in various prewalking types of mobility (69.7% vs 63.8%), and proficiency in ability to walk with help and to stand independently (22.8% vs 18.0%).
* At [about 2 years of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.20.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.20.asp)], the exact same patterns were found, only this time the cognitive disparities were more pronounced. White children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, a greater percentage of white children demonstrated ability to recognize and understand spoken words or to indicate a named object by pointing (88.7% vs 79.4%), verbal expressiveness using gestures, words, and sentences (70.7% vs 55.7%), ability to understand actions depicted by a story, in pictures, or by verbal instructions, and proficiency in engaging in early problem solving (42.2% vs 29.9%), and ability to match objects by their properties (e.g., color) or differentiate one object from another (37.1% vs 25.5%). In contrast, black children outperformed white children on every measure of motor skill. For example, compared to white children, a greater percentage of black children ability to use fine motor control with hands (58.0% vs 55.8%) and ability to walk up and down stairs (50.2% vs 48.4%).
* Finally, at [about 4 years of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.30.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905225118/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.30.asp)], we again found similar patterns regarding cognitive skills. White children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, white children achieved higher average early reading scale scores (27.4 vs 22.9) and mathematics scale scores (31.6 vs 26.9), and a greater percentage of white children were able to name the colors of five pictured objects (71.0% vs 55.3%). However, unlike the results from the earlier followups, black children did not outperform white children in motor skills. In fact, white children had a slightly greater average fine motor score (3.5 vs 3.2).

A more recent longitudinal study by the ECLS measured child reading and mathematics scores from kindergarten to fifth grade. The results were consistent with the results presented earlier:

* In 2010, Black kindergarteners had lower [reading scores](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.40.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905231355/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.40.asp)] as early as the fall of kindergarten. Specifically, the black-white reading score gap was 3.1 points (SD=10.5) in the fall of kindergarten. The gap grew to 4.9 points by the spring (SD = 13.2). The gap grew to 7.6 points in the first grade (SD=16.5) and remained fairly stable until the fifth grade. Interestingly, black kindergarteners actually outperformed several other ethnic groups in the fall, including Hispanics (53.0 vs 50.8), Pacific Islanders (53.0 vs 52.7), and American Indians/Alaska Natives (53.0 vs 52.7). However, by the spring of third grade, black children had the lowest reading scores of all ethnic groups.
* Similar racial gaps of a greater magnitude were found for [mathematics scores](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.41.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905231354/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.41.asp)]. The black-white mathematics score gap was 6.7 points (SD=10.7) in the fall of kindergarten. The gap grew to 9.3 points by the spring (SD = 12.4). The gap grew to 11.7 points in the first grade (SD=14.4) and 15.7 points in the second grade (SD=16.6). The gap remained fairly stable until the fifth grade where the gap was 16.1 points (SD=15.8). Interestingly, black kindergarteners actually outperformed Hispanics (32.0 vs 31.4) in the fall. However, by the spring of kindergarten, black children had lower mathematics scores than Hispanics and every other ethnic group. To show how significant these gaps are, the black-white mathematics gap was nearly a full standard deviation by second grade (the same magnitude as the black-white IQ gap). The most worrying finding here may be that white/Asian *third* graders outperform black *fifth* graders in mathematics.

### Misconduct

**Black-White Gaps**

Black children display disproportionate levels of misconduct very early:

* A [2010 report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)] on urban middle schoolers by the Southern Poverty Law Center showed that black males are nearly 3 times as likely as white males to be suspended (28.3% vs 10%) [Figure 2]. Black females are over 4 times as likely as white females to be suspended (18% vs 4%) [Figure 2].
* A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] on discipline disparities shows that the racial disparity in suspension rate is not accounted for by controlling for level of school poverty. At every level of school poverty, black students are significantly more likely to be suspended than any other race of students. In fact, the out-of-school suspension rate for black students attending schools with the lowest level of poverty (7.5%) is _higher_ than the rate for white students attending schools with the highest level of poverty (7.3%) [Table 14].

This misconduct appears even at _preschool_:

* A [2014 report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)] by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights shows that "Black students represent 18% of preschool enrollment, but 42% of preschool students suspended once, and 48% of students suspended more than once."
* A [2016 article](https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html)] by the LA Times reported that "although black girls represent 20% of preschool enrollment, 54% of preschool girls suspended once or more were black."
* A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] on discipline disparities shows black preschoolers are over 3 times as likely as white preschoolers to be suspended (1.1% vs 0.3%) [Table 17].

Now, some people might accept these facts but deny that it demonstrates early  _misconduct_  by black children. One might argue that this demonstrates only that black children are disproportionately _punished_ for _alleged_ misconduct, but it doesn’t show that they disproportionately _engage_ in misconduct. Such a person might argue that teachers and principals around the country have an anti-black bias when deciding who to punish for alleged misconduct. To this argument, I have a few responses:

* While black teachers suspend black children at lower rates than white teachers do, they still suspend black children at a rate several times that of white children. For example, white male teachers suspend black male students at 3 times the rate of white male students (15.4% vs 5.2%), and black male teachers suspend black male students at 2.4 times the rate of white male students (12.7% vs 5.3%) [source: see [Figure 2](https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)] [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)]. So if racial differences in suspension rates are due to an anti-black bias, it looks like the same bias is found among black teachers. While this is certainly possible, it is less plausible.
* A [2014 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)] published in the _Journal of Criminal Justice_ found that prior problem behavior accounts for the racial disparity in school suspensions: "Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature." The study concludes, "these findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued." This finding is completely unexpected if we assume teachers had a strong anti-black bias. After all, if a teacher had an anti-black bias, why would she treat black and white students identically if they had comparable histories? Does her anti-black bias magically disappear when she’s considering blacks and whites with the same history? No, the best explanation is that black students are suspended more because they are more likely to misbehave.
* According to a [report](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200904074024/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp)] by the National Center for Education Statistics, black kindergartners are significantly more likely to *report* having been physically assaulted by other students. In particular, in 2010, the percentage of first-time black kindergartners who report having been “pushed, shoved, slapped, hit, or kicked other students” (7.9%) is over 6 times greater than the percentage of first-time white kindergartners who report the same (1.2%).

### Self-regulation

Stability

**Black-White Gaps**

[Watts et. al (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6050075/) attempted to replicate the famous marshmallow study by [Shoda et. al](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-06927-001). Researchers examined the relationship between ability to delay gratification at preschoolers and academic and behavioral outcomes at age 15. The ability to delay gratification was measured by presenting the 54-moths-old children with a treat and giving them two options: (a) they could wait 7 minutes before eating the treat, in which case they would eat the treat and get a reward, or (b) they could eat the treat before 7 minutes and get no reward. The measure of delay of gratification was recorded as the number of seconds the child waited (7 minutes being the maximum). The results were as follows:

* Consistent with other research regarding self-regulation, there was a significant correlation between the ability to delay gratification at age 7 and outcomes at age 15. The correlation between minutes waited and Grade 1 academic achievement among nondegreed mothers was 0.28. The results suggested that children’s Grade 1 achievement would improve by approximately 0.1 standard deviations for every additional minute waited at age 4. Similar correlations were found for age 15 academic achievement (table 4). Note that the association between minutes waited and academic achievement was almost entirely accounted for after controlling child characteristics (gender, race, and birth weight), family background (maternal age and education, and family income), quality of home environment, child temperament at 6 months, child vocabulary at 36 months, child cognitive functioning at 24 months and 36 months, and a variety of measures of cognitive and behavioral skills and problems. This should not be surprising, since the predictive power of ability to delay gratification may be due to its association with the broader cognitive and behavioral abilities controlled for here.
* The study revealed, among children of nondegreed mothers (n=552), the black children had lower waiting times than white children. Despite constituting 16% of the children of nondegreed mothers (table 1), they constituted 24% of the children of nondegreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes and only 7% of the children waited 7 minutes (table 3). Among nondegreed mothers, 81% of black children (0.24 × 301 / 0.16 × 552) failed to wait for 7 minutes, while only 48% of white children (0.64 × 301 / 0.73 × 552) failed to wait for 7 minutes (552=total number of children of nondegreed mothers [table 1]; 0.16 (0.73) = proportion of children of nondegreed mothers who are black (white), respectively [table 1]; 0.24 (0.64) = proportion of children of nondegreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes who are black (white) [table 3]). 
* A similar disparity was found among children of degree mothers (n=336). Despite constituting 2% of the children of degreed mothers (table 1), they constituted 5% of the children of degreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes. Among degreed mothers, 86% of black children (.05 × 301 / .02 × 336) failed to wait for 7 minutes, while only 32% of white children (.85 × 301 / .91 × 336) failed to wait for 7 minutes (336=total number of children of degreed mothers [table 1]; 0.02 (0.91) = proportion of children of degreed mothers who are black (white), respectively [table 1]; 0.05 (0.85) = proportion of children of degreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes who are black (white) [table 3]). 

[Duckworth et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782117/) conducted two longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students to compare the relative impacts of self-control and intelligence on academic achievement. The purpose of these studies was to measure the degree to which self-control and intelligence predictive later achievement on standardized test scores and school grades. The results of the studies are as follows:

* The first study was a data analysis of a sample of the 1,364 students in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD-SECCYD). Self-control and IQ data were collected from participants in the 4th grade. Self-control was measured by reports from the participant’s mother, father, and teacher. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). As expected, both 4th grade IQ and self-control, particularly from teacher reports, were associated with later test scores and grades (both teacher-reported self-control and IQ correlated with 8th grade IQ at r=0.44, table 1). The study also found a significant *inverse* correlation between black and all measures of self-control (table 1). In fact, the negative correlation between black and teacher-reported self-control (the most predictive measure of self-control) was almost as great in magnitude as the negative correlation between black and IQ (r=–0.30 vs r=–0.35).
* The second study involved 510 5th through 8th grade students at two public schools in New York City. Self-control was measured using reports from homeroom teachers, parents, and students who completed the Impulsivity Scale for Children (ISC) test with students as targets. IQ was measured using scores on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test. Again, teacher-reported self-control was more predictive of success than other measures of self-control. In fact, teacher-reported self-control outperformed IQ in predicting spring GPA (r=0.55 vs r=0.40) (table 3). Like study 1, this study also found a significant inverse correlation between black and all measures of self-control (table 3). In fact, the negative correlation between black and teacher-reported self-control (the most predictive measure of self-control) was greater in magnitude than the negative correlation between black and IQ (r=–0.18 vs r=–0.12).

[Duncan and Magnuson (2011)](http://sites.uci.edu/gduncan/files/2013/06/Duncan-Magnuson-including-web-appendix-032112.pdf) reviewed literature on the "association between early achievement, attention, and behavior and later school achievement and such late-adolescent schooling outcomes as dropping out and college attendance." As expected, they found that persistent achievement or behavior problems were predictive of outcomes later in life (including, e.g. high school graduation, college attendance, early-adult crime, etc.) (see executive summary). Some of the findings are as follows: 

* Using data from the NLSY, they found significant associations between persistent anti-social and attention problems at ages 6, 8, and 10 and the probability of graduating high school, attending college by age 21/22, and being arrested (tables 3.A10 and 3.A12). Many of these associations disappeared after controlling for an extensive list of controls, including race, gender, % years in poverty, number of children, parental marital status, mother academic aptitude, etc. (see footnote of table 3.A9 for the full list of controls). However, persistent anti-social behavioral problems impressively maintained a significant association with being arrested despite these controls. 
* Significant black-white gaps in these behavioral problems appear as early as kindergarten and gradually grow until the 5th grade. For example, the black-white gap attention/engagement grows from 0.36 standard deviations (SDs) to 0.44 SDs between the 1st and the 5th grade (Figure 3.3). The black-white gap in anti-social behavior grows from 0.31 SDs to 0.5 SDs between the 1st and the 5th grade (Figure 3.4).

Finally, consider [Elder and Zhou (2017)](https://msu.edu/~telder/Noncog_Skills_Current.pdf), the one study I found with the expressed purpose of investigating black-white gaps. They analyze data from various cohorts of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) to measure the black-white gap in non-cognitive and to measure any changes over time. Non-cognitive skills are measured using a variety of teacher reports of child behavior. The study here analyzes three components of non-cognitive skills: "one meant to capture externalizing problem behaviors like arguing and getting into fights, one meant to capture elements of self-control in interacting with peers, and one meant to capture “approaches to learning”, which encompasses attentiveness, task-persistence, and motivation (page 3). The basic results are as follows:

* White children outperform black children on all three measures of non-cognitive skills (page 8). The ECLS-K:2011 cohort demonstrated a black-white gap that grew from kindergarten to 3rd grade among all three measures of non-cognitive skills. The gap in approaches to learning grew from 0.33 standard deviations (SDs) to 0.52 SDs, the gap in externalizing problem behaviors grew from 0.40 SDs to 0.52 SDs, and the gap in self-control grew from 0.40 SDs to 0.58 SDs (table 1a, or column 1 of table 5). The ECLS-K:1999 cohort revealed a similar pattern (table 1b). The authors note that "the non-cognitive skill
gaps are remarkably stable across cohorts" (page 3), consistent with test score gaps which show that "after declining for decades, the black-white test score gap has remained roughly constant since the early 1990s" (page 3). 
* The authors note that these reported gaps are actually severe *under*-estimates of the actual non-cognitive skill gaps because "teachers’ opinions for what constitutes 'normal' levels of achievement and behavior are systematically different in schools with disadvantaged student populations as compared to more advantaged schools" (page 15). After correcting for systematic differences in teachers' perception of "normal", the true black-white gap in non-cognitive skills is significantly larger. For the ECLS-K:2011 cohort, the gap in non-cognitive skills grew from 0.66-0.67 SDs in kindergarten to 0.81-0.83 SDs in 3rd grade (column 3 of table 5).
* The gaps in non-cognitive skills was partially reduced after controlling for home environment, school environment, and differences in teacher perceptions. The home environment includes paternal education, parental marital status, whether the child lives in a two-parent household, number of books owned by the child, SES composite index, and child birth weight. Specifically, the non-cognitive skill gaps in kindergarten reduced from 0.33-0.40 SDs to 0.24-0.26 SDs after adding these controls (column 5 of table 5). The non-cognitive skill gaps in 3rd grade reduced from 0.52-0.58 SDs to 0.20-0.27 SDs after adding the controls (column 5 of table 5). So these controls accounted for about one-third to one-half of the black-white gaps in non-cognitive skills. Most of the gap in non-cognitive skills persisted, particularly kindergarten gaps, even after accounting for the controls.
