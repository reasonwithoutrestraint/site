Normativity is concerned with what we ought to do, how the world ought to be, what we have reason to do, what is good/bad, right/wrong, what is justified/unjustified, warranted/unwarranted, etc. Normative claims can be contrasted with descriptive claims as the latter are concerned with how the world *actually* is (or *has* been or *will* be) whereas the former are concerned with how the world *should* be. Perhaps the most popular domain of normativity is morality. Morality concerns (roughly) standards for regulating human behavior. [Morality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/#NormDefiMora) can be undertood in a *descriptive* sense (i.e. as *describing* the standards that are endorsed by a person or society) or in a *normative* sense (i.e. as *prescribing* the standards that *ought* to guide an individual's or society's behavior). The purpose of this post is to argue against normative skepticism. I define "normative skepticism" as the rejection of normative reasons. I will argue that some people *do* have normative reasons. Before providing these arguments, I begin by describing in more detail the nature and ubiquity of normative reasons.

### What are normative reasons

I believe that the central normative concept is that of the concept of a normative *reason*. I will be assuming in this post what Thomas Scanlon calls "Reasons Fundamentalism", which he describes as the view that "truths about reasons are not reducible to or identifiable with non-normative truths" and possibly the view that reasons are "the only fundamental elements of the normative domain" (page 2 of [*Being Realistic about Reasons*](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199678488.001.0001/acprof-9780199678488)) (in the same way that [G.E. Moore](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore-moral/#2) believed that "good" is a "simple" and "unanalyzable" concept). This is a thesis [shared by many promiment philosophers](https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170918220343/https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf)] such as Derek Parfit and (as already mentioned) Thomas Scanlon. Some philosophers disagree with reasons fundamentalism, such as [Ralph Wedgwood](https://388dba3f-a-cdfe13b2-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/usc.edu/wedgwood/online-papers/Unity_of_Normativity.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cpXtXlhcs-fY7CKO0ik9FVbscFhtDsa4SlnfoLroBlWyLp4hO1ymWClYkSjEcnkIgJ2omQ0fEtnEs4_suHz75S-S9DQZ0fW2U7zbY1r04gYWYwCzUYNykVrcHqHb6Ugp6Fzw2hJUTKR4BrdRFBdzZef8I60OxrpLCfILPFgeu59JfaQibA15f67y_pZx8_44jmzBtynG4pDTeHrFi1eAuLJq2GTYS3xZfdZGXu1q9Vckdzs5dQ%3D&attredirects=0) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200711033134/https://388dba3f-a-cdfe13b2-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/usc.edu/wedgwood/online-papers/Unity_of_Normativity.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqOWhj-leGyDLd0WzrLQL9TCLUgvJ7QqVDgQ089AU7KYi-biTFKIQCkSqDnxAwuKMAqMbzP_F_HyhzkohQMWPs2JDY2PTtKtPwzJRzSVSBDcPgH7g-kGooYYLKpkcJydmZxEQy-63_DreipI-DVLPh66OguguGY4xWy1eRsh_jg5Nldm3IFZRp5RtR5dsURZ4Wz_aw9kote1SCW0zW46eh6nu8gPC24WcHGbJd7LrQCcRfqQAE%3D&attredirects=1)] and [John Broome](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/Reason%20versus%20ought.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200710025112/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0060/pdf/Reason%20versus%20ought.pdf)]. However, my assumption of reasons fundamentalism is not essential to any of the arguments that I present below. I mention my assumption of reasons fundamentalism only to explain why the post is primarily concerned with "reasons" over other normative concepts. All of my arguments can be reformulated without losing substance with an alternative normative concept instead of "reasons".

What are normative reasons? Normative reasons are a concept that we are all implicitly familiar with, so the best way to illuminate the concept may be to consider some examples. One type of normative reason concerns [_practical_ reasons]([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/#NormReas]) (or reasons for _action_):

> a reason is said to be a “normative reason” for acting because it favours someone’s acting. But what does it mean to say that a reason “favours” an action? One way of understanding this claim is in terms of justification: a reason justifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This is why normative reasons are also called “justifying” reasons. 

Reasons for action aren't the only kind of normative reasons. In ["The Metaphysics of Reasons"](https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170918220343/https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf)] Jonas Olson gives examples of other kinds of reasons:

> We talk about normative reasons when we say, for example, that there were no reasons to invade Iraq in 2003; when we say that there is reason to stay sober the night before a fi­nal exam; or when we say that there are reasons to believe that the universe is billions of years old. We can say that the first kind of normative reason is moral, the second pruden­tial, and the third epistemic"

This passage lists examples of reasons for two kinds of attitudes - epistemic reasons as reasons for _beliefs_, and moral and prudential reasons as reasons for _actions_. But beliefs and actions aren't the only kinds of attitudes for which there can be reasons. People can have reason to desire things, to admire others, to appreciate things, to fear things, etc. I believe that the class of attitudes for which an agent can have reasons is what Thomas Scanlon calls judgment sensitive attitudes in Chapter 1 of [_What We Owe to Each Other_](https://philpapers.org/rec/SCAWWO):

> The class of attitudes for which reasons in the sense I have in mind can sensibly be asked for or offered can be characterized, with apparent but I think innocent circularity, as the class of “judgment-sensitive attitudes.” These are attitudes that an ideally rational person would come to have whenever that person judged there to be sufficient reasons for them and that would, in an ideally rational person, “extinguish” when that person judged them not to be supported by reasons of the appropriate kind. Hunger is obviously not a judgment-sensitive attitude; but belief is, and so are fear, anger, admiration, respect, and other evaluative attitudes such as the view that fame is worth seeking

What kinds of _things_ can be reasons? I will accept the consensus view that ["normative reasons are facts"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/) (for simplicity, I assume that a "fact" is simply a true proposition). Futher, claims about normative reasons are generally taken to be relational claims involving at least three entities. For example, claim about normative reasons for action "establishes a relation between a fact, an agent, and an action kind" such that the _fact_ gives the agent _reason_ to perform the _action_. Note that one could have normative reason for a variety of attitudes, not just actions. Normative reasons generally establish the same relation between a fact, an agent, and an _attitude_ (an action can be understood as an intention, which is a kind of attitude). For example, the fact that _Adam will enjoy reading this book_ (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to intend (the attitude) to read that book. For another example, the fact that _Bob entered the building wearing a rain coat drenched in water_ (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to believe (the attitude) that it is raining outside.

If its not already clear by now, I would like to stress the fact that *normative* reasons are distinct from *motivating* or *explanatory* reasons. The latter kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the "reason _that_" an agent did or will do something. The former kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the "reason _to_" do something. For example, imagine that John is hungry and is presented with poisonous food which he doesn’t know is poisonous. On the one hand, if he eats the food, we can posit an _explanatory_ reason for why he ate the food; the reason _that_ John ate the food consists in the fact that he was hungry and he believed the food was not poisonous. This would be an answer to the question “Why _did_ John eat the food?” On the other hand, we can also posit a _normative_ or _justifying_ reason to not eat the food; the reason _to_ not eat the food consists in the fact that it is poisonous (combined with the fact that John probably doesn’t want to be poisoned). This would be an answer to the question “Why _should_ John eat or not eat the food?” See this [SEP article](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/#NormReas) for more on the distinction between motivating/explanatory reasons and normative/justifying reasons.

Note that what is important here is the _concept_ of a reason, not the _term_ "reason". The term "reason" is merely a linguistic device that English speakers have constructed to express the _concept_. But there is nothing inherently special about this linguistic device. Just as rocks would exist if we hadn't invented the term "rock", so too would individuals have reasons even if we didn't have the term "reason". To see why, consider the fact that non-English speakers clearly also have terms to refer to reasons, and these terms in their language express the same concept that "reason" expresses in English. Further, the concept of a _reason_ concept can be expressed using other synonymous terms within English. For example, when one says "A has decisive reason to do X" (where X = adopting an attitude, a desire, a belief, etc.), this can also be interpreted as "A _ought_ to do X", "it is _rational_ for A to do X", "A is _warranted_ in doing X", "A is _justified_ in doing X", "it _makes sense_ for A to do X", etc. All of these statements express the same idea despite using different terms. This shows that what's special about normative concepts lies not in any particular terminology. Throughout the post, I will use the term "reasons" when referring to normative reasons, but sometimes I may use terminology such as "what is justified" or  "what is rational", etc. to refer to the same concept.

### The ubiquity of normative reasons

Now that meaning of normative reasons has been clarified, I would like to stress the fact that normative judgments are found in every aspect of our thinking.

All philosophers engage with the concept of normative reasons in some capacity, particularly epistemic normative reasons. Epistemic normative reasons (also called theoretical normative reasons) are different from normative reasons generally in that epistemic normative reasons are concerned with reasons for _belief_, whereas, say, practical normative reasons are concerned with reason for reasons for _action_.

Every philosopher advances a claim about epistemic reasons when they present an _argument_ for a claim. Arguments provide premises that _support_ their conclusions. In other words, arguments provide premises which (if true) provide _reason_ to believe the conclusion of the argument by appeal to some (often implicit) inference rule (e.g. [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)). There are different valid inference rules depending on the mode of reasoning being employed. For example, [deductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning), [inductive reasoning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-inductive/) and [abductive reasoning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/) provide different inference rules that underline the reasons that the premises of an argument provide for a conclusion. Other philosophical debates are more explicitly concerned with disputes about epistemic reasons. For example, questions about the [analysis of knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/), about theories of knowledge (e.g. [foundationalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/) vs [coherentism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/)), about the proper methods for establishing knowledge (e.g. [empiricist vs rationalist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/)), etc. are best seen as disputes (in part) about _epistemic justification_, i.e. disputes about what we have _reason_ to believe. Questions of these kinds (which are essentially concerned with epistemic reasons) have significance to all of philosophy since all philosophers (even the most ardent skeptics) are interested in determining what we are justified in believing.

For a more practical example of the importance of epistemic reasons, consider an epistemic guide that almost everyone accepts: [Occam's Razor](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/#OckhRazo). Occam's Razor is best formulated as a thesis about our epistemic reasons. For example, the [SEP article on simplicity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/#Int) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200618183518/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/)] gives the following formulation of Occam's Razor: 

> If theory T is simpler than theory T*, then it is rational (other things being equal) to believe T rather than T*. Or it may be formulated as a methodological principle: if T is simpler than T* then it is rational to adopt T as one's working theory for scientific purposes.

But what does it mean for it be rationale to believe T rather than T*? Of course, it must mean that there is more epistemic reason to believe T rather than T*.

Similar remarks can be said about every dispute in philosophy. All parties in debates regarding the existence of [determinism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/), the existence of [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/), the truth of [compatibilism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/), the truth of [skepticism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/), the existence of [external reality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/), etc. believe that there is more (epistemic) reason in favor of their particular side of the debate. Even skeptics of an area believe that we have more reason to be skeptical than we have to assume knowledge in that area.

These points demonstrate that philosophers are essentially concerned with forming *normative judgments*, i.e. judgments about normative reasons. We also find ample examples of normative judgments in ordinary people. For example, when you ask someone why they hold the beliefs that they hold, they usually explain their beliefs by appeal to (what they consider to be) _evidence_ for their beliefs. But what is "evidence"? Evidence is [that which justifies belief](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/#EviWhiJusBel) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200702100349/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/)]. But _justified belief_ is synonymous with beliefs that we have normative _reason_ to hold. For another example, almost everyone agrees that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is round than there is that the Earth is flat. But even flat-Earthers must believe that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is flat. Either way, virtually everyone accepts that there is more evidence in favor of certain beliefs over others. In other words, virtually everyone accepts normative reasons.

### Arguments against normative skepticism

Now that the definition and ubiquity of normative reasons have been illustrated, I will now provide arguments against normative skepticism, i.e. arguments that there *are* normative reasons. 

**All deliberative agents are committed to rejecting normative skepticism**

My first argument will emphasize an earlier point about the ubiquity of normative judgments. Earlier, I noted that normative judgments are made by virtually everyone, including both philosophers and ordinary people. However, the ubiquity of normative judgments is deeper than that. The capacity and disposition to form normative judgments are *essential* to our nature *insofar as we are deliberative beings*. In [*The Sources of Normativity*](https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/k/korsgaard94.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190810030439/https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/k/korsgaard94.pdf)] (pages 78-79), Christine Korsgaard stresses this point when she notes that humans, unlike many lower animals, do not merely form beliefs based on our immediate perceptions or form intentions based on our immediate desires. As "essentially reflective" creatures, we are capable of thinking *about* our perceptions, desires, beliefs, intentions, and other thoughts. This capacity to "back up" from our attitudes sets up what Korsgaard calls "the problem of the normative", i.e. this capacity allows us to question and evaluate whether our attitudes are appropriate. In other words, the capacity for self-reflection enables us to question what attitudes (what beliefs, intentions, desires, etc.) we have *reason* to hold. *Deliberation* is the process of attempting to answer this normative question. In other words, the process of deliberation is a process of determining what to do, what to believe, and how to feel; and these determinations are based on our judgment that there are *reasons* for or against certain attitudes. Therefore, all rational agents, insfoar as they are deliberative, are essentially committed to the judgment that there are *reasons* in favor of certain beliefs, intentions, or feelings. In ["An Outline of an Argument for Robust Metanormative Realism"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2607202), David Enoch raises a similar point when he argues that "in deliberating, you commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation" (page 38).

Now, one might object that our commitment to normative reasons does not entail that there *really are* normative reasons. This is technically true. However, I still believe that exposing this commitment constitutes is a good argument for normative reasons. I believe this because I believe that arguments are largely a discursive device. Specifically, the primary purpose of an argument (I believe) is to rationally motivate an interlocutor to accept a claim that they do not already accept. One argumentative strategy to accomplish this purpose is to provide *reasons* to accept the conclusion of an argument. However, such a strategy must appear question-begging for this particular argument because my interlocutor does not already acccept that there are reasons. Instead, another argumentative strategy is to show that an interlocutor is *already* committed to the claim (whether they know it or not). That's exactly what I've done here as I've shown that all agents (insofar as they are deliberative) are committed to normative reasons. Therefore, my interlocutor (insofar as they are deliberative) is also committed to there being normative reasons, and this is sufficient to ground a solid argument in favor of normative reasons.

**Some beliefs are justified**

This argument is largely borrowed from Richard Rowland's paper ["Moral Error Theory and the Argument from Epistemic Reasons"](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/78d1/d6dcf0f56dbbf8394c4d114f50121419ad13.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606183140/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/78d1/d6dcf0f56dbbf8394c4d114f50121419ad13.pdf)] (page 14):

1. Normative skepticism is the denial of normative reasons.
2. Some beliefs are justified.
3. In order for a belief to be justified, there must be normative reason to hold the belief.
4. Therefore, we have normative reasons (from 2, 3, and 4).
5. Therefore, normative skepticism is false (from 1 and 5).

The most controversial premise here is premise 2, but I think it can be shown to be true rather easily. I will show that some of my beliefs are justified by merely listing some examples that all sane persons should accept (some of these are taken from the Rowland paper linked earlier): I am justified in believing that I do not know everything, that I am thinking, that I am having certain experiences and feelings right now, that I perceive myself to be typing on a keyboard at the moment, that certain logical and mathematical propositions (e.g. 1+1 = 2) are true, etc. Every sane person should concede that *some* of these beliefs are justified. But even this minor concession is sufficient to demonstrate that there are normative reasons, for justified belief requires that there are normative *reasons* in favor of the belief.

**Normative skepticism is self-defeating**

My last argument will show that normative skepticism is self-defeating (which I believe to be the best kind of argument). I will start by showing that normative skepticism is unjustified if it is true:

1. Assume normative skepticism is true.
2. In order for a position to be justified, there must be normative reason to believe the position.
3. Therefore, there are no normative reasons to believe anything (from 1).
4. Therefore, normative skepticism is unjustified (from 2 and 3).

Thus, even if normative skepticism is true, it would be unjustified. But propositions that would be unjustified if true are unreasonable (this should not be a controversial assumption!). Therefore, normative skepticism is unreasonable.

Terrence Cuneo provides a similar argument in his book [*The Normative Web: An Argument for Moral Realism*](https://philpapers.org/rec/CUNTNW).

## Conclusion

This suffices to show that normative skepticism is unreasonable, i.e. that there *are* normative reasons. I provided three arguments in favor of there being normative reasons. I argued that all deliberative agents are committed to there being normative reasons, that some beliefs are justified (implying that there are some normative reasons), and that normative skepticism is self-defeating (since it implies that it itself is unjustified). 

An interesting implication of my argument here is that (I believe) it also suffices to demonstrate [*categorical*](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/#KanHypImp)  (as opposed to *hypothetical*) normative reasons, i.e. normative reasons which are not contingent on an agent's ends or interests. The reason for this is that arguments that I have given here demonstrate that there are *epistemic* reasons, which do not depend on an agent's ends or interests. Surely, whether a agent's belief is justified or whether there is evidence for a an agent's belief does not depend on that agent's ends or interests. For example, an agent's ends or interests might be best served by having *unjustified* beliefs (e.g. a theist's belief in God might advance his intersts - e.g. it might make him happier - regardless of whether the belief was justified). This has some important implications on debates in other areas of philosophy such as metaethics. For example, many arguments for moral skepticism are premised on the claim that morality purports to issue categorical practical reasons and the claim that categorical practical reasons are implausible. My arguments here have only demonstrated categorical *epistemic* reasons and not categorical *practical* reasons which morality is concerned with, so my arguments here have not demonstrated refuted these particular arguments for moral skepticism. However, I believe the existence of categorical epistemic reasons *does* lend some credence to the existence of categorical practical reasons (since it shows that there are categorical normative reasons). Now, I do believe that there *are* categorical practical reasons (counter the kinds of arguments for moral skepticism mentioned here), but a full defense requires a separate post.
