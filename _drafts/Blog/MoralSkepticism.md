In response to “I can’t understand categorical reasons”:
-   Consider epistemic reasons.  
-   Consider your own moral beliefs. You judge that it’s morally wrong to torture babies, i.e. that we morally ought not torture babies, i.e. that we have overriding moral reason to not torture babies. Is this judgment coontingent on the particular goals of the agent? Probably not.
- Consider the instrumental principle. That itself is a categorical reason. That is, we have reason to take the means to fulfill our ends regardless of our own ends. Which means we have reason to take the means to fulfill our ends is independent of our own ends.

Internalism is not a problem for morality    
-   Either internalism is argued as a conceptual truth. In which case, clearly internal reasons are a different concept than moral reasons.
-   Or internalism is argued as a substantive truth. In which case, there can be no argument strong enough to deny our intuitions that one ought not torture for fun.

Against:
* Error Theory
* Moral Relativism
	- There may be some agent-relativity with regard to whether we have reason to *blame* someone. I.e. we only have reaosn to blame agents who are potentially motivated by moral considerations. But the moral standards themselves are not agent-relative, i.e. an action X might be wrong, but we might not have reason to blame someone for doing X, because of specific circumstances (e.g. they are disabled, they had a fit of rage, they were incapable of being motivated by moral considerations, etc.). We can still have the standards however. E.g. imagine an agent completely immoved by their future self. We can objectively say that their actions are objectively *imprudent*, or even that they have *prudential reasons* against their behavior, despite the complete lack of motivation from them. 
		- The *standards* for morality and prudence (at least, for some standards) or not agent-relative.
		- However, the appropriate reaction we have to those who violate the standards, and whether or not someone is *irrational* for violating those standards, might be agent-relative.
		- Relativists claim that there are no objective moral standards because there is no way to rationally resolve moral disagreements
			- Same with most normative domains. How do we rationally resolve disputes about foundational vs coherentism? How do we rationally resolve disputes about what is prudent?
			- Also, maybe we can rationally resolve these disputes. But that's a question for normative ethics, not metaethics.
			- Why is this the standard? Some interpretations of "rationally resolvable dispute":
				- Dispute that can be resolved by persuading the parties
					- Too high of a standard. This rules out truth about logical reasoning.
				- Dispute that can be resolved by following the logical extension of all parties' beliefs
					- Too high of a standard. This rules out the truth of most epistemic principles (e.g. induction) and even instrumental reasoning.
				- Dispute that can be resolved via purely instrumental reasoning from any agent's moral views",
					- What about epistemic principles? Also, this seems arbitrary. Why is the principle of *instrumental* reasoning applied to *moral* reasoning? Why not consider whether a dispute can be rationally resolved given that agents have the primary aim of rationally resolving their disputes?
		- The moral norms specify the conditions where it would have reason to blame a *moral* agent who violated those standards.
			- But this does not mean that the moral norms themselves are relative. The moral norms are still absolute/objective. E.g. the imperative is "do not rape people for pleasure"; it is NOT "do not rape people for pleasure *unless you are not a moral agent*"
			- The norms themselves are objective/absolute. They are made true by the hypothetical agreements of fully rational agents who had the primary aim of rationally resolving ethical disputes.
	- This relativity applies equally well to epistemic normativity. E.g. imagine a being that formed beliefs but their beliefs had no concern for logical consistency. Imagine that they never formed higher order beliefs (e.g. beliefs about their beliefs), so they never recognized that their beliefs were inconsistent.
		- We could say that this create was objectively *illogical*, or (*imprudent* or *immoral*).
		- But we couldn't say that the being was *irrational*.
	- Note: whether someone is *subject* to morality is mind-dependent, i.e. they must be a *moral agent*, i.e. a rational agent capable of recognizing moral reasons. However, the moral norms/reasons themselves is not mind-dependent. So if a non-moral agent violated a moral norm, we can say that the *act* was wrong, but it wouldn't really make sense to say that *he* was wrong. 

### (1) What is moral skepticism?

Anything that denies this:
* Some moral propositions have truth value (in a minimalist sense)
	- Actually, don't argue for (non-minimal) truth. E.g. there is debate as to whether Kant believed that moral claims where truth apt. I'm not trying to argue against Kantianism (even if Kantianism portrays morality as being non truth-apt).
* Some such propositions are attitude-independently true
* Some such propositions provide all rational agents with non-institutional reason for action
* Some such propositions ascribe categorical imperatives 
* There are some moral propositions X such that we have good reason to believe X possesses the above qualities

Basically, it is attitude-independently true that we have normative reason to follow certain categorical imperatives

My opposition:
* Error Theory - there are no true moral propositions
* Subjectivism - what _makes_ a moral proposition true is some agent(s) belief in the proposition
* Relativism - all true moral propositions are conditional on an agent's individual or cultural practices, conventions or traditions.

## Argument (20)

### (1) Walkthrough

Argue against Moral skepticism, not for moral realism
* After all, I’m not arguing against Kantians

Argue that moral skepticism is “unreasonable”, not that moral realism “true”
* "unreasonable" = not "reasonable"
* This allows us to complete the argument by showing continuity between morality and reasons.
* We don’t need to show continuity between reasons and ordinary descriptive facts
* This drives home the point that what’s “reasonable” is what anyone cares about.
* If the title was “moral skepticism is false”, this might fail because (a) I succeed in finding continuity between morality and reasons, but people counter that reasons are not true, or (b) I try to find continuity between reasons and truth, but people reject this.

Defensive arguments

1. Skepticism about all normative claims is unreasonable.
2. If skepticism about all normative claims is unreasonable, then skepticism about all moral claims is reasonable only if there is a distinction between all moral claims and all non-moral normative claims generally that _explains_ why skepticism about the former but not the latter is reasonable.
3. There is no distinction between all moral claims and all non-moral normative claims that _explains_ why skepticism about the former but not the latter is reasonable.
4. Therefore, skepticism about all moral claims is not reasonable.
5. Conclusion: moral skepticism is unreasonable.

## Normative reasons

Perhaps the biggest distinction between moral claims and ordinary claims is that [moral claims are _normative_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/) whereas ordinary claims tend to be _descriptive_. Moral claims are normative because they prescribe how agents _ought_ to act and how the world _ought_ to be, whereas descriptive claims merely describe agents _actually_ act and how the world _actually_ is. So one might think the problem with moral claims stems from the fact that they are normative. So let us investigate whether there is anything problematic with normative claims.

## Practical reasons

If the above is correct, then there are clearly some true claims about our epistemic reasons, which means there are some true normative claims. Therefore, if skepticism about moral claims is justified, then it must be justified on the basis of some feature of moral claims that is not a feature of all normative propositions. So what is so special about moral claims that warrants skepticism about moral claims that does not also warrant skepticism about normative claims generally? To investigate this question, we need to determine what distinguishes moral claims specifically from normative claims generally.

Perhaps it is the fact that moral claims are issue _practical reasons_ as opposed to _epistemic reasons_ which were considered above. Recall that _practical_ reasons are concerned with reasons for action, whereas _epistemc_ reasons are concerned with reasons for belief (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason/#PraTheRea) for more on this distinction). So what are the best arguments to be skeptical about practical reasons? As far as I know, there are none (seriously, I don't know of any philosophers that deny practical reasons). There doesn't seem to be anything special about practical reasons that makes them less credible than epistemic reasons. 

### Argument against practical reasons

One argument against practical reasons that might seem intuitive could be one that draws on the fact that _beliefs_ (but not _actions_) are capable of being true, which explains why we can have normative reasons for the former but not the latter. For example, one might provide the following argument:

1. Beliefs can be true.
2. Actions cannot be true.
3. A claim that one has _reason_ to adopt an attitude can be true only if that attitude itself is true.
4. Therefore, there can be true claims about what one has reason to _believe_, but there cannot be true claims about how one ought to _act_.

The problem with this argument is premise 3. Premise 3 implies that a belief can be justified only if that belief is true. But this is clearly false. It is possible for a false belief to be justified. The justification for belief in a proposition is based on the _evidence_ for that proposition, but one can have _evidence_ for a false proposition. For example, because it is almost statistically impossible that any particular person will win the lottery, it would be unjustified for anyone to assume that they will win the lottery. In fact, people are justified in predicting that they will _not_ win the lottery. But of course some people do win the lottery. Does this mean that lottery winners, prior to actually winning the lottery, would have been justified in predicting that they will win? Of course not. Whether a belief is justified depends on the _evidence_ that is available, not on any future events.

Another argument is as follows:

1. Epistemic reasons can be reduced to facts about probability
2. Facts about probability are non-normative facts
3. 
4. From 1 and 2, epistemic reasons can be reduced to non-normative facts
5. Practical reasons for an action are not considerations that raise the probability of that action 
6. Etc...

So, as far as I'm aware, there is nothing particularly problematic about practical reasons specifically. Thus, if we grant that there are epistemic reasons (which we must grant), then we should also grant that there are practical reasons. Just as epistemic reasons are considered whenever we deliberate about what to _believe_, practical reasons are considered whenever we deliberate about what to _do_. Thus, the presence of practical reasoning is just as ubiquitous as the presence of epistemic reasoning. In fact, almost everyone accepts that [instrumental rationality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/) provides reasons for _action_, i.e. almost everyone accepts that rational agents have reason to adopt the means to fulfill their ends. For example, it seems obvious that if someone values healthy teeth, then they have _reason_ to regularly brush their teeth. Further, insofar as someone fails to adopt the means to fulfill their ends, they are acting _irrationally_ (assuming there are no other reasons rejec their ends). This kind of reasoning - i.e. deliberation about practical reasons - is almost always present when we decide what to do. People do not act on their most immediate impulse or desire. Rather, we determine and weigh the _reasons_ that favor one action over another before forming an intention.

## Moral reasons

### What are moral reasons?

If the above is correct, then there are clearly some true claims about our practical reasons, which means there are some true normative practical claims. Therefore, if skepticism about moral claims is justified, then it must be justified on the basis of some feature of moral claims that is not a feature of all practical normative claims. So what is so special about moral claims that warrants skepticism about moral claims that does not also warrant skepticism about practical normative claims generally? To investigate this question, we need to determine what distinguishes moral claims specifically from practical normative claims generally.

So what is special about moral claims? Most philosophers grant that moral claims are in some sense "social" or "impartial" ("other-regarding" reasons) whereas practical reasoning generally may be concerned solely with the individual ("self-regarding" reasons). For example, whereas instrumental reasoning is a form of practical reasoning that is only concerned with the ends of the agent in question, moral reasoning is a form of practical reasoning that - in some sense - is concerned with the ends of all being affected by the agent's actions. There are many [ways to define](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/#Vari) the "social" or "impartial" feature that is special to moral reasons. For example, in ["Moral Realism"](http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/chang/papers/railton-moralrealism.pdf), Peter Railton states that "moral norms reflect a certain kind of rationality, rationality not from the point of view of any particular individual, but from what might be called a social point of view." According to [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/#NormDefiMora), most "non-religiously influenced philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition limit morality to behavior that, directly or indirectly, affects others". Other philosophers argue that morality is concerned with norms that can be [justified to others](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/). As you can see, there are many variations in defining the "social" or "impartial" core of morality. 

Certain normative ethical theories can be seen as attempts to characterize this "impartial" or "social" component of morality. For example, in John Rawls's [original position](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/), parties are to determine which principles of justice are most rational for them. But the decisions are made behind a "veil of ignorance"; this can be seen as an attempt to indirectly account for the impartial aspect of morality, by making it rational for each individual to care about the welfare of others. Or consider utilitarianism. Many people accept [rational egoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/#RatiEgoi) as a theory of individual rationality, yet accept [utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) over [ethical egoism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egoism/#EthiEgoi) as a moral theory because it is a conceptual constraint of moral theories (but not theories of rationality generally) that they give weight to the interests of all sentient creatures. Note, however, that some philosophers deny that there is any distinction between practical reasons generally and moral reasons specifically. For example, [Kant](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/) believed that the supreme principle of morality - the Categorical Imperative - rationally necessary, certain egoists (those who accept rational egoism and ethical egoism) can maintain that morality and rationality converge on promoting one's self interest, and some philosophers (those who [reject personal identity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-ethics/#IdeNorEth)) can maintain that morality and rationality converge on promoting the interests of everyone. However, I believe most philosophers believe that moral reasons differ from other non-moral practical reasons in that the former is concerned with other-regarding interests whereas the latter may be solely concerned with self-regarding interests.

Other philosophers say that moral norms are special not because they prescribe certain reasons for _action_, but because they prescribe certain reasons for our _responses_ to certain actions. For example, [Allan Gibbard](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2381318) claims:

> An act is wrong if and only if it violates standards for ruling out actions such that if an agent in a normal frame of mind violated those standards because he was not substantially motivated to conform to them, he would be to blame. To say that he would be to blame, here, is to say that it would be rational for him to feel guilty and for others to resent him.

On this view, what is special to moral claims is not just that they prescribe reasons to _act_, but that they also prescribe reasons to _resent_ and reasons to feel _guilt_ (contrast this with e.g. instrumental reasons, which prescribe reasons for action, but not with reasons to feel resentment or guilt). Other philosophers argue that moral norms provide reasons for other attitudes. [For example](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-definition/#MoraLinkNormForRespBeha), moral reasons might be the rules picked out "by appropriate norms for praise and blame, and other social sanctions."

### Categorical Practical Reasons

One aspect of moral reasons that may seem to warrant skepticism is the fact that moral reasons _issue_ categorical imperatives. Hypothetical imperatives are normative prescriptions that apply to an agent which are dependent on the agent's desires or motivations whereas categorical imperatives apply independently of an agent's desires or motivations. For example, imagine that it's raining outside. Now, consider the prescription: "Adam should grab an umbrella before leaving his house". Whether or not this prescription is true - i.e. whether Adam _should_ grab an umbrella - depends on Adam's desires. If Adam desires to avoid getting wet, then he _should_ take the umbrella. But if he desires to become soaked, then he should _not_ take the umbrella. This prescription would be a hypothetical imperative since it's application depends on the relevant agent's desires. On the other hand, I believe moral norms _purport_ to issue categorical imperatives. For example, the prescription that you should not torture others applies independently of the agent's particular desires. Even _if_ you desire to torture, it is still true that you should _not_ do so. I take it to be a conceptual truth that morality purports to issue categorical imperatives. The categorical nature of morality seems to be _constitutive_ of the concept of morality. Thus, if someone were to deny that moral norms were categorical, then they wouldn't really be talking about morality (they might be referring to a different domain of practical reasons, such as instrumental reasons or prudential reasons). Many error theorists about morality, such as J.L. Mackie, believe that morality purports to issue categorical imperatives (Mackie denies categorical imperatives, which partially explains why he is an error theorist about morality). So if we are to avoid moral skepticism, we must avoid skepticism about categorical imperatives.

As far as I know, the primary motivation for skepticism of categorical imperatives is something like [reasons internalism]([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/]) (I will refer to merely as "internalism" from now on). Internalism states that in order for a consideration to be a reason for an agent to act in a certain way, that consideration must bear a special relation to the agent's motivations. For the sake of simplicity, I will only consider forms of internalism that claim that reasons must bear a relationship to the agent's _actual_ motivations (as opposed to their hypothetical or counterfactual motivations). Various philosophers have appealed to some sort of internalism to support skepticism of either morality or categorical imperatives (e.g. see Philippa Foot's ["Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives"](http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/laurier/textes/phi-6330-h12/Foot-Morality-Hypothetical-Imperatives-72.pdf) or [Chapter 1](https://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/readings/mackie.pdf) from J.L. Mackie's _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_). [The Humean Theory of Reasons](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#HumTheRea) is one example of an internalist theory. It states that in order for an agent to have a reason to perform an act, that agent must have a desire that would be served by performing the act. Other forms of internalism may appeal to other motivating attitudes, such as emotions or intentions. It should be clear that [internalism directly contradicts categorical imperatives](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#CenPro). Therefore, if we are to avoid skepticism about categorical imperatives (and thus moral skepticism), we must show what is wrong with reasons internalism.

One reason to accept reasons internalism is acceptance of something like a motivational intermalism, i.e. one will always be motivated to do what they take themselves to have reason to do. But, as Korsgaard notes, this is not necessarily true, even in the case of instrumental reasons. Rather, one will always be motivated to do what they believe they have reason to do insofar as they are *instrumentally rational*.

As I've argued [elsewhere](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/reasons-internalism-an-argument-from-theoretical-reasons/]), reasons internalism seems like a plausible thesis. However, I now believe that the thesis is only true for specific _types_ of reasons. For example, regarding practical reasons, reasons internalism might make sense as a constraint on [_instrumental reasons_]([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/]). But why assume this must apply to _all_ practical reasons? Why not hold that other kinds of practical reasons that operate differently? For example, consider prudential reasons, which are a class of practical reasons that are concerned with an present and _future_ ends and interests. Whereas instrumental reasons are concerned only with an agent's present ends, prudential reasons are concerned also with an agent's longterm ends and interests. As Derek Parfit has [argued](http://www.stafforini.com/docs//parfit_-_rationality_and_reasons.pdf), it certainly seems plausible to say that an agent has reason to promote their future ends and interests, _even if this conflicts with their current ends_.

For example, imagine that Bob must decide whether to eat a pack of peanuts to eat. If Bob eats the peanuts, this will provide a minor source of pleasure for Bob in the next five minutes because he loves the taste of peanuts. But it will also cause an immense source of suffering for several days starting tomorrow because he has strong peanut allergies. Because Bob values his future wellbeing, he decides not to eat the peanuts since the immense suffering of his allergic reaction over several days far exceeds the minor pleasure of the taste of peanuts for a few minutes. Most people would agree that this was clearly a reasonable decision, i.e. it was the decision that Bob had most reason to make. But now imagine that Bob has unknowningly consumed a pill that significantly raised his [time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) for a short period of time. The pill has caused him to value his wellbeing within the next five minutes. He does not care at all about his wellbeing more than five minutes in the future. Everything else about his psychology remains the same. 

Now, imagine that Bob again has to decide whether to eat a pack of peanuts. Does he still have reason to reject the peanuts? It see quite obvious to me that he _does_ have reason to reject the peanuts. He just isn't aware of the reason (everyone accepts that people can be ignorant about their normative reasons). The reason to reject the peanuts in this case is the same as the reason to reject the peanuts in the original case: the fact that it will cause him immense suffering over a few days. However, if the kind of internalism considered here is correct, this fact would _not_ be a reason for Bob to reject the peanuts, since this fact bears no relation to Bob's motivations (due to the pill). This seems obviously wrong. There may be a _sense_ in which Bob does have reason to eat the peanuts, but there is also _another_ sense in which Bob does _not_ have reason to eat the peanuts. That is, we should say that Bob has _instrumental_ reason to eat the peanuts (since that would promote his current ends most), but we should also say that he has _prudential_ reason to not do so. It seems far more plausible so that Bob has these two different _types_ of reasons than to deny that prudential reason is present.

For these reasons, I believe reasons internalism should be rejected as a theory about _all_ practical reasons. It should be restricted only to particular classes of practical reasons, i.e. instrumental reasons. However, there are other classes of practical reasons, e.g. prudential reasons, that are not bound by the internalism constraint. Prudential reasons are also an example of _categorical_ practical reasons. People have (prudential) to promote their future desires and interests, _even if they don't have any current desire that would be served by doing so_. Like prudential reasons, _moral_ reasons are another source of practical reasons which are not bound by the internalism constraint and which issue categorical imperatives. In fact, moral reasons can be seen as structurally similar to prudential reasons in the following sense. Whereas an agent's prudential reasons can be distinguished from his instrumental reasons in that prudential reasons include concern for his _future_ self, an agent's moral reasons can be distinguished from his personal or egoistic reasons in that moral reasons include concerns for persons _other_ than the agent in question. To echo an argument made by Derek Parfit, it seems that internalists are referring to a different concept of "reason" when they constrain reasons to an agent's motivations, i.e. they are referring specifically to e.g. instrumental reasons and not to _all_ classes of reasons such as e.g. prudential or moral reasons. 

### Attitude-independence

The final aspect of moral reasons that many find objectionable is that they purport to be *attitude-independent*. Following Stephen Finlay's ["Four Faces of Moral Realism"](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/1292/docs/FFMR-preprint.pdf), there are four different way to understand what is meant by "attitude-independence" (Finlay uses the phrase "attitude-independent" in the paper):

* *Semantic*: moral *claims* have objective truth values, i.e. the truth values are independent of the attitudes that anyone takes towards the moral claims.
* Ontological: there exists robust moral *facts*, facts i.e. moral properties, relations or entities.
* Metaphysical: there exists moral facts are attitude-independent moral *facts*, i.e. moral facts that do not consist in what anyone’s attitudes are or would be under any condition.,
* Normative: morality is authoritative for agents independently of their desires and other motivational attitudes.

I will be arguing for *semantic* attitude-independence. My argument is agnostic with respect to ontological and metaphysical attitude-independence. As for normative attitude-independence, this is merely a form of categorical reasons, which I argued for in the previous section.

It might be objected that defending *semantic* attitude-independence is not sufficient to avoid moral skepticism. Rather, one needs also to defend ontological attitude-independence in order to avoid moral skepticism. But this seems obviously. For example, Immanuel Kant is commonly interpreted as rejecting the existence of an ontological moral realm of attitude-independent moral facts. Rather, he believed that morality (and rationality generally) were intimately connected with our attitudes; he believed that moral truth was constituitive of our agency. In fact, he argued that an ontological moral realm - if such a realm existed - could not be authoritative for humans as rational agents. Modern Kantians such as Korsgaard should not be considered skeptics, yet they also deny that ontological attitude-indepence. Kosgaard accepts semantic realism because she believes that moral questions have attitude-independent *answers*, but denies ontological realism because she believes moral questions *practical* answers rather than *theoretical* answers, i.e. moral questions are questions about what to do, not questions about how the (moral) world *is*. Surely, no one would argue that *Kant* was a moral skeptic. Thus, it is clearly false to assume that ontological attitude-independence is needed to avoid moral skepticism.

Once we are clear that we are concerned with ontological independence, we can handle many of the objections to moral attitude-independence. For example, consider some of J.L. Mackie's arguments against "objective" moral truth.

Robust moral realism - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/#Sub
Mackie - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/moral-error-theory.html
Mackie - https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ethics%3A-Inventing-Right-and-Wrong-Mackie/0bd79287b60b4418a0cf25e7196252f7c2ccffbf

Mackie - arguments that only attack robust realism
- The argument from queerness - Epistemological and metaphysical
- The argument from supervenience
- This is only an issue for robust realism. I.e. Plato's Forms, Robust Non-naturalism

Consider other normative reasons
- There are some attitude-independent constraints on non-moral, practical reasons
	* Instrumental reasoning
	* Ought implies can
	* Supervenience
- There are some attitude-independent epistemic reasons
	* Occam's razor
	* Logical consistency
	* Induction

Consider if the truth of moral claims *change* based on the attitudes that we have towards those claims.

Consider if the truth of moral claims are *explained* by the attitudes that we have towards those claims.

Independence
- Attitude-independent norms (no ontological independence)
- Against Mackie's arguments against ontological realism
- Against Mackie's relativity argument
- Against institutional argument

## Conclusion

### Remaining issues

* Epistemology
* Ontology
* Evolution

### The true goal

* Moral realists are really interested in showing a continuity between moral reasons and normativity generally.
* Give morality the same respect/dignity that we give epistemology
* People treat morality with this disdain that is not warranted

### The argument here is very permissive

* It is compatible with non-cognitivism that accept novel explanations of "truth"
* It is compatible with non-ontological forms of non-naturalism
* It is compatible with non-subjective forms of naturalism
