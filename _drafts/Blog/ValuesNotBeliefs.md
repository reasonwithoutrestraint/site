World-to-mind fit vs mind-to-world fit

Desire vs Belief vs Special attitude

## Characteristics

1. Ubiquity -> This is not an advantage for either
2. A priori -> Against naturalism
3. Supervenience -> Against non-naturalism
4. Disagreement -> Against naturalism
5. Translations/Flexibility/Socialization -> Against all descriptivism

6. Motivation -> Against all Descriptivism

Non-cognitivism > Naturalism + Non-naturalism
