## Distinguish from From non-normative

Non-normative meanings of normative terms
* Normative vs explanatory
* Normative “should”/”ought” vs predictive “should”/”ought”

## Ontology

* Normativity is not a property of language
	- What makes normative terms normative?
	- How do we determine whether terms in other languages are normative?
	- How about normative statements that do not use normative terms, e.g. "a man is nothing without his word"
* Normativity is not a property of reality
* Normativity is a property of thought

## Normative Concepts

### Domains

* Rationality
* Prudence
* Epistemology
* Aesthetics
* Morality

### Internal Reduction

Reasons / Oughts / Justification / Warranted / Credible

Accounts
* R is a reason for A to F iff R explains why A has reason to F.
* R has reason to F iff this relation plays a weighing explanation in why A ought to F.
* see “Reason versus ought” by Broome
* Also see “Reasons as explanation vs Evidence” (or something like that)

### Aspects of relativity

Objective (potential) vs subjective (available)
* Same concept: objective reason = subjective reasons under full information

Different attitudes for different agents

Different kinds of attitudes
* Practical reasons = reasons to act
* Epistemic reasons = reasons to believe
* Aesthetic reasons = reasons to admire/appreciate

Different kinds of practical reasons: 
* Rational reasons = instrumental reasons given the ends of the agent
* Prudential reasons = instrumental reasons given the ends of the agent and the agent’s future self.
* Moral reasons = instrumental reasons given the ends of everyone

Other distinctions
* Agent-neutral vs agent-relative
* Internal vs External
* Object-given vs State-given reasons
* Right vs Wrong kinds of reasons

## Psychology

* We commit ourselves to make normative judgments whenever we behave intentionally/deliberatively
* We judge ourselves to have reason to X whenever we conclude that X is to be done at the outcome of deliberation (i.e. whenever form an answer to the practical questino)

## Further questions

### External Connections

* Only rational agents can have reasons
* Ought implies can
* Supervenience
* Is/ought gap

### Other questions

* External reduction (seems implausible)
* Nature of normative judgments
* Conditions for normative truth (if any)
* How to acquire normative knowledge
