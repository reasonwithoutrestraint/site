## Not Beliefs

See other post

## Not obviously desires

- One can desire something but not value it (e.g. drug addict, procrastination)

## Not strongest desires

- One can not value their STRONGEST desire 
- Values have constituitive characteristics. E.g. if A values X, and believes X -> Y, then A must value X. This is not true for desires.

## Not any desires (desires about desires)

- The act of stepping back from our desires and choosing which ones to act on, is the act of determining which desire we have most reason to endorse, not the act of determining which desire is strongest. THAT can be determined without reflection.
	- This is true even under instrumental rationality. So even if this reasoning ultimately results in choosing that which will most satisfy one's desire in the longrun, this choice is still a normative judgment, not a desire itself. The agent would just judge that they have normative reason to satisfy their desires in the longrun, even though - in the short run - their stronger desire might be something else.
	- Instrumental rationality requires that normative judgments are not mere desires. E.g. if someone strongest or highest-order desire is X but does not pursue it, this is not irrational. On the other hand, if someone judges that they have strongest reason to X, but does not pursue it, then this IS irrational because they are not doing what they value (on scanlon's definition of irrationality which is to not do something that they take to be irrational).

## Desires can't explain other normative domains

e.g. judgments about epistemic reasons

## Values are a simple

Can't be reduced, similar to normative concepts
