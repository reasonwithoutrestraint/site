## Degree of disparities

**Black criminality**

As most people know (hopefully), blacks are extremely disproportionatelyThe purpose of this post is to explore two commonly hypothesized explanations of rampant levels of black criminality. The first explanation states that the rampant levels of black criminality is primarily the result of systemic racism against blacks. The second explanation states that black criminality is primarily the result of the structural or socioeconomic circumstances that blacks find themselves in. I will present data that suggests that both of these explanations are faulty. I argue that, relative to alternative explanations which I mention at the end of the post, systemic racism and socioeconomic status (SES) play little to no causal role in explaining the rampant levels of black criminality. But before explaining this, I will first illustrate the high levels of black criminality relative to non-blacks.

## The degree of black criminality

**Black criminality**

Blacks are significantly more likely to engage in criminal activity relative to other racial groups. I write about this in more detail in a  [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/), so I’ll just mention some of the key indicators of excessively disproportionate crime in the black population.a few key points here:

-   Blacks commit 37% of violent crime despite being 13% of the general population ([FBI crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605235303/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)]).
-   Blacks commit 53% of murders and 54% of robberies ([FBI crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605235303/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)]).
-   Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15-19, aged 20-24, and aged 25-35 (see  [page 34](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)]).
-   Homicide is the cause of _most_ deaths (50.8%) of black males aged 15-19 and nearly _half_ (49.6%) of deaths of black males aged 20-24 (see page 34). For comparison, homicide was the cause of only 3-5% of the deaths of white males of this age (see  [page 27](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)]).
-   The homicide death rate for blacks aged 20-24 (110.8 deaths per 100,000 population; page 34) is over _20 times_ the rate for similarly aged whites (5.4 deaths per 100,000 population;  [page 27](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)]).
- Among the 10 cities with the highest homicide rates in the country, 4 are black majorities and 9 are black pluralities (see my [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/) for sources).

**Early black misconduct**

Now, consider the fact that disproportionateRampant levels of misconduct appears in black children far before they interact with the criminal justice system. This misconduct appears even appearsvery early in life, as early ats preschool. I give more details in a  [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/), but here are some important facts:

-   A  [2010 report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)] on urban middle schoolers by the Southern Poverty Law Center showed that black males are nearly 3 times as likely as white males to be suspended (28.3% vs 10%) [Figure 2]. Black females are over 4 times as likely as white females to be suspended (18% vs 4%) [Figure 2].
-   A  [2014 report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)] by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights shows that “Black students represent 18% of preschool enrollment, but 42% of preschool students suspended once, and 48% of students suspended more than once.”
-   A  [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] on discipline disparities shows black preschoolers are over 3 times as likely as white preschoolers to be suspended (1.1% vs 0.3%) [Table 17].
-   A  [2014 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)] published in the  _Journal of Criminal Justice_  found that prior problem behavior accounts for the racial disparity in school suspensions: “Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature.” The study concludes, “these findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued.”

## Systemic Racism

E.g. 
* biased policing,
* systemic racism
* Transgenerational trauma https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/02/legacy-trauma
* etc.

**Non-black minorities**

Systemic racism is a poor explanation forSome people try to explain black criminality by appealing to alleged systemic racism in the United States. These types explanations are undermined by the following facts: (1) the rate of criminality for other non-black minorities in the United States, (2) the low rate of incarceration for black legal immigrants, and (3) the fact that comparable relative levels of black criminality exists in other countries. 

**Non-black minorities**

Explanations of black criminality that rest on appeals to systemic racism in the U.S. are undermined by low rates of criminality (relative to the rate of black criminality) for other racial minorities. Systemic racism cannot explain why blacks have far higher crime rates than other non-black minoritievery other racial group in the United States:

* The homicide rate for blacks (10.3 homicides per 100k) is 4-5about 4 times higher than the rate for Hispanics (2.71 per 100k) Hispanics and, 5 times higher than the rate for American Indians or Alaska Natives (1.95 per 100k), and nearly 15 times the rate for Asians and Pacific Islanders (0.727 per 100k). (homicide rates calculated using [FBI crime statistics 2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605235303/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)] and [U.S. Census 2019 population data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608170556/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218)]).
* Among 20-24 year-old males, the homicide death rate for blacks (110.8 per 100k) is over 4 times the rate for Hispanics (22.5 per 100k) and, over 4 times the rate for American Indians or Alaska Natives (26.4 per 100k), and over 25 times the rate for Asians and Pacific Islanders (4.2 per 100k). ([National Vital Statistics Reports 2018](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)). Homicide death rates can be a good indication of murder rates since [data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200530095126/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls)] from the FBI suggest that crime is overwhelmingly intra-racial.

SAlso, systemic racism is also a poor explanation forcannot explain why Asians have lower crime rates than whites:

* The homicide rate for Asians and Pacific Islanders (0.727 per 100k) is less than half the rate for whites (1.69 per 100k) (homicide rates calculated using [FBI crime statistics 2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605235303/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)] and [U.S. Census 2019 population data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608170556/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218)]).
* Among 20-24 year-old males, the homicide death rate for Asians and Pacific Islanders (4.2 per 100k) is lower than the death rate for whites (5.4 per 100k) ([National Vital Statistics Reports 2018](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)).

**Black immigrants**

According to [a 2018 brief](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/their-numbers-demographics-countries-origin)Systemic racism might seem plausible as an explanation for why blacks have higher crime rates relative to whites. One might be able to argue that society is structured in a way that benefits the majority at the expense of the minorities, which ultimately results in blacks being compelled to commit crimes through a variety of social forces. That might seem plausible, but this cannot explain why blacks have far higher crime rates than every other racial minority in the country. Surely, systemic racism harms these other racial minorities too? Appealing to systemic racism as an explanation of black criminality requires positing that, for some strange reason, the societal bias against *black* people specifically is extremely stronger than the societal bias against other racial minorities (presumably, the bias needs to be *extremely* stronger to explain why blacks are *extremely* more likely to engage in criminality). This may seem plausible for certain minorities but not for *all* other minorities. For example, the genocidal history of Native Americans in the United States would suggest that anti-Native American bias is at least not *extremely* weaker than anti-black bias. But even if it can be demonstrated that societal bias against blacks is extremely stronger than bias for other racial minorities, one still needs to demonstrate a *mechanism* that *explains* how this anti-black bias *causes* blacks to commit crimes to such extreme degrees. It is implausible that any of this can be demonstrated.

**Black immigrants**

Another problem with systemic racism as an explanation of black criminality is the relatively low rate of incarceration for black legal immigrants. For example, according to [a 2018 brief](https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/their-numbers-demographics-countries-origin) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200519010248/https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/their-numbers-demographics-countries-origin)] by the Cato Institute, black immigrants have far lower crime rates than black natives. The incarceration rate for black legal immigrants, while high relative to other legal immigrants, areis low relative to natives. In fact, the incarceration rate for black legal immigrants is lower than the rate for natives of all racial groups, including white and Asian natives (Table 1). This is poorly explained if systemic racism is the primary cause of the elevated rates of crime in the black population. If arrests by police have an anti-black bias, or if the criminal justice system is biased against blacks, and this bias explains elevated crime rates in the black population, then why doesn't this exact same (keep in mind that incarceration rates are also a good measure of crime rates, as I've shown in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/)).

This would be an unexpected outcome if systemic racism was a significant cause of black criminality. If societal anti-black bias explains black criminality, then shouldn't this anti-black bias also apply to black immigrants? Does the anti-black bias only apply to nativesblack residents who are *citizens*? This is implausible. A bettergood explanation is that systemic racism plays little to no role in elevated crime rates in the black population.

**Black criminality around the world**

Now, consider the fact that we find similar relative levels of black criminality in other countries. I give more detailed facts in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/), but here are a few important points:

-   **United Kingdom**: according to  [data from the UK Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)], black people are arrested at 3 times the rate for white people (66.9 vs 22.8 per 1,000 population) [Table 3.12] and represented 13.1% of the prison population [Table 5.03] despite representing 3.1% of the general population [Table A].  [Crime statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606012412/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)] by the UK government show that for the three-year period year ending March 2017 to the year ending March 2019, blacks accounted for 18% of principal suspects for homicide. This implies that the black homicide rate is over 6 times the white homicide rate, a similar pattern that is found in the United States.
-   **Canada**: a  [fact sheet](https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023409/https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf)] by the  [Colour of Poverty](https://colourofpoverty.ca/fact-sheets/)  reported “In 2016, black people comprise 3.5% of the general Canadian population, but made up 10% of the federally incarcerated population.” A  [2014 commentary](https://scinapse.io/papers/2025963420)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024845/https://health.gradstudies.yorku.ca/files/2016/09/The-Canadian-war-on-drugs-Structural-violence-and-unequal-treatment-of-blacks.pdf?x35134)] revealed that “homicide rates among blacks in Montreal were estimated to be as high as 24 per 100,000, strikingly higher than their white counterparts at 3 per 100,000” (page 193). This implies that the black homicide rate is 8 times the white homicide rate, a similar pattern found in the United States.
-   **Brazil**: a  [2019 article](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/brazils-violence-map-shows-alarming-trends)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/brazils-violence-map-shows-alarming-trends)] published in  _Think Brazil_  reported that “In 2017, the number of blacks killed was almost three times higher than among non-blacks (a group encompassing white, Asian, and indigenous people).” A  [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763365/)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928045040/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763365/)] published in  _Aggression and Violent Behavior_  grouped the homicide rates by race and found that the homicide rate for blacks (34.6 per 100,000) was over 2 times the rate for whites (16.3), and over 5 times the rate for Asians (6.8) (see section 4.1). Trends in homicide rates can be found  [here](https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608025123/https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract)].
-   Consider  _[The Handbook of Crime Correlates](https://archive.org/details/LeeEllisKevinM.BeaverJohnWrightHandbookOfCrimeCorrelates/page/n7/mode/2up)_, a huge book published in 2009 that collects the summary analysis of crime research around the world. Table 2.3.2a summarized the results of a large number of studies that compared the rates of violent crime by blacks and whites in North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Oceania.  _Every_  study found that being black was significantly associated with criminality. Also, every study that compared the rates of non-violent criminal and delinquent behavior found that being black was significantly associated with property offenses, drug offenses, and delinquency (Table 2.3.2b).

https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2017/01/07/the-black-white-crime-gap-across-nations-time-and-age/

**United States**

Recall from the above that blacks have far higher crime rates than Hispanics and American Indians or Alaska Natives. These disparities in crime are poorly explained by disparities in poverty because the black poverty rate (25.8%) is similar to the poverty rate for Hispanics (23.2%) and American Indians or Alaska Natives (23.9%) ([U.S. Census Bureau 2013](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605200257/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf)], Table 1).

Now, recall that whites have higher crime rates than Asians. Again, these disparities in crime are poorly explained by disparities in poverty because Asians are more likely to be poor than whites. The poverty rate for Asians (11.6%) is higher than the rate for non-Hispanic whites (9.9%) ([U.S. Census Bureau 2013](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf), Table 1).

Of course, poverty is not the only component of SES, so perhaps it is other components of SES that explains why blacks are so much more likely to commit crimes than other poor groups such as Hisanics or American Indians and Alaska Natives. However, these other components cannot be an explanation either, because blacks perform similar or better than these other groups on most other measures of SES:

* *Unemployment*: based on a 2018 report by the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2018/pdf/home.pdf), blacks have typically experienced similar unemployment rates as American Indians and Alaska Natives (Tables 12 and 12A). In fact, In recent years (2015-2018), blacks have experienced lower unemployment rates. Compared to Hispanics, blacks have experienced slightly higher unemployment rates (Table 12).
* *Labor Participation*: Based on the same report, blacks have typically experienced higher labor force participation rates than American Indians and Alaska Natives (Table 4 and 4A). Compared to Hispanics, blacks have experienced fairly similar labor force participation rates (Table 4).
* *Parental education*: [a 2019 report](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019144.pdf) published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shows that the parents of black children are more likely to have graduated from high school and to have acaquired a bachelor's or higher degree than the parents of Hispanic or American Indians and Alaska Native children (page 18). 
* *High school graduation*: the same NCES report shows that the high school graduation rate for blacks (78%) was higher than the rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives (72%) and very similar to the rate for Hispanics (80%) (page 124). 
* *High school completion*: the same NCES report shows that a higher proportion of blacks had completed high school by age 25-29 than both Hispanics and American Indians or Alaska Natives (page 237).
* *College education*: the same NCES report shows that blacks aged 25-29 are more likely to have earned a bachelor's degree than similarly aged Hispanics or American Indian and Alaska Natives (page 239).
* *Youth Idleness*: the same NCES report shows that blacks aged 18-24 are less likely to be neither enrolled in school nor working than American Indian and Alaska Natives (22% vs 29%) (page 243). The figure for blacks was moderately larger than the figure for Hispanics (16%).
* *Literacy*: the [2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy](https://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470_1.PDF) found that the literacy rate for blacks was higher than for Hispanics on every metric (although in 1992, the black literacy rate was slightly lower than the Hispanic literacy rate). Data was not published for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

I've considered 9 measures of SES: poverty, unemployment, labor force participation, parental education, high school graduation, high school completion, college education, youth idleness, and literacy. Compared to American Indians and Native Alaskans, blacks have better characteristics with respect to each metric for which we have data for both groups (aside from unemployment, as the two groups have similar unemployment rates). Compared to Hispanics, black have better or very similar characteristics with respect to 7 of the 9 metrics: poverty, labor force participation, high school graduation, high school completion, college education, parental education, and literacy (blacks perform worse with regard to unemployment and youth idleness). 

Therefore, there does not appear to be extreme disparities in SES between blacks and other poor groups in the United States. Thus, we should be skeptical that SES is the cause of black criminality, since we find similar deprivation in other poor groups (i.e. Hispanics and American Indian and Alaska Natives). A good explanation of disproportionate black criminality should explain why blacks are so much more likely than Hispanics and American Indians and Alaska Natives to commit crimes. This rules out many of the traditional measures of SES (the measures of SES that I considered earlier).

**United Kingdom**

Just like in the United States, blacks in the United Kingdom have far higher crime rates than Asians:

* [Crime statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606012412/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)] by the U.K.	 government show that for the three-year period year ending March 2017 to the year ending March 2019, blacks accounted for 18% of principal suspect of a homicide offense. This is despite the fact that they account for just 3.4% of the general population (figure 1 from the [United Kingdom Census 2011](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200613151047/https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest)]). For reference, Asians accounted for 9% of murder suspects despite being 7.5% of the population. This implies that the black murder rate is over 4 times the Asian murder rate in Londonof high levels of black *native* criminality relative to black *immigrants* must appeal to some factor other than systemic racism. And this factor, whatever it is, likely accounts for high levels of black criminality relative to non-blacks. Thus, the best explanation of black criminality in the United States likely does not involve any appeal to systemic racism.

**Black criminality around the world**

The final problem with systemic racism as an explanation of black criminality is the fact that comparable relative levels of black criminality exist in other countries. I give more details on black criminality worldwide in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/), but here are a few important points:

-   **United Kingdom**: according to  [data from the UK Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)], black people are arrested at 3 times the rate for white people (66.9 vs 22.8 per 1,000 population) [Table 3.12] and represented 13.1% of the prison population [Table 5.03] despite representing 3.1% of the general population [Table A].  [Crime statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606012412/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)] by the UK government show that for the three-year period year ending March 2017 to the year ending March 2019, blacks accounted for 18% of principal suspects for homicide. This implies that the black homicide rate is over 6 times the white homicide rate, a similar pattern that is found in the United States.

-   Consider  _[The Handbook of Crime Correlates](https://archive.org/details/LeeEllisKevinM.BeaverJohnWrightHandbookOfCrimeCorrelates/page/n7/mode/2up)_, a huge book published in 2009 that collects the summary analysis of crime research around the world. Table 2.3.2a summarized the results of a large number of studies that compared the rates of violent crime by blacks and whites in North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Oceania.  _Every_  study found that being black was significantly associated with criminality. Also, every study that compared the rates of non-violent criminal and delinquent behavior found that being black was significantly associated with property offenses, drug offenses, and delinquency (Table 2.3.2b).

This would be an unexpected outcome if systemic racism was the primary cause of black criminality in the United States. If societal anti-black bias explains black criminality in the United States, then why do we find comparable rates of black criminality around the world? Do all of these other countries have similar levels of anti-black bias, despite wildly different histories and cultures? This is implausible. A good explanation of black criminality outside of the United States must appeal to some factor other than systemic racism. And this factor, whatever it is, likely accounts for black criminality in the United States. Thus, the best explanation of black criminality in the United States likely does not involve any appeal to systemic racism. In fact, the evidence presented in this section - the relatively low rates of crime among non-black minorities, the low rate of crime among black legal immigrants, and the high rates of black criminality in other countries - suggests that systemic racism plays little to no causal role in explaining black criminality.

## Reasons to be skeptical of SES-based explanations of black criminality

Perhaps the most commonly posited explanation of black criminality appeals to the low socioeconomic status (SES) of blacks. But we should be skeptical of these SES-based explanations given that the crime rate for blacks is extremely higher than the crime rate for other low-SES racial groups. I will give examples of this pattern in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. 

**United States**

Recall from the above that blacks have far higher crime rates than Hispanics and American Indians or Alaska Natives. These disparities in crime are poorly explained by disparities in poverty because the black poverty rate (25.8%) is similar to the poverty rate for Hispanics (23.2%) and American Indians or Alaska Natives (23.9%) ([U.S. Census Bureau 2013](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605200257/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf)], Table 1).

Now, recall that whites have higher crime rates than Asians. Again, these disparities in crime are poorly explained by disparities in poverty because the Asian poverty rate (11.6%) is higher than the white poverty rate (9.9%) ([U.S. Census Bureau 2013](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf), Table 1).

Of course, poverty is not the only measure of SES. Perhaps other measures of SES explain high levels of black criminality relative to other poor minority groups. However, this explanation will not work either, because blacks perform similar or better than these other groups on most other measures of SES:

* *Unemployment*: based on a 2018 report by the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2018/pdf/home.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200424205558/https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2018/pdf/home.pdf)], blacks have typically experienced similar unemployment rates as American Indians and Alaska Natives (Tables 12 and 12A). In fact, In recent years (2015-2018), blacks have experienced lower unemployment rates. Compared to Hispanics, blacks have experienced slightly higher unemployment rates (Table 12).
* *Labor Participation*: Based on the same report, blacks have typically experienced higher labor force participation rates than American Indians and Alaska Natives (Table 4 and 4A). Compared to Hispanics, blacks have experienced fairly similar labor force participation rates (Table 4).
* *Parental education*: [a 2019 report](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019144.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200621224543/https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019144.pdf)] published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) shows that the parents of black children are more likely to have graduated from high school and to have acquired a bachelor's or higher degree than the parents of Hispanic or American Indians and Alaska Native children (page 18). 
* *High school graduation*: the same NCES report shows that the high school graduation rate for blacks (78%) was higher than the rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives (72%) and very similar to the rate for Hispanics (80%) (page 124). 
* *High school completion*: the same NCES report shows that blacks are more likely to have completed high school by age 25-29 than Hispanics and American Indians or Alaska Natives (page 237).
* *College education*: the same NCES report shows that blacks aged 25-29 are more likely to have earned a bachelor's degree than Hispanics or American Indian and Alaska Natives (page 239).
* *Youth Idleness*: the same NCES report shows that blacks aged 18-24 are less likely to be neither enrolled in school nor working than American Indian and Alaska Natives (22% vs 29%) (page 243). The figure for blacks was moderately larger than the figure for Hispanics (16%).
* *Literacy*: the [2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy](https://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470_1.PDF) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200623160906/https://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/PDF/2006470_1.PDF)] found that the literacy rate for blacks was higher than for Hispanics on every metric (although in 1992, the black literacy rate was slightly lower than the Hispanic literacy rate). Data was not published for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

I've considered 9 measures of SES: poverty, unemployment, labor force participation, parental education, high school graduation, high school completion, college education, youth idleness, and literacy. Compared to American Indians and Native Alaskans, blacks perform better or similarly with respect to each metric for which we have data for both groups. Compared to Hispanics, black perform better or similarly with respect to 7 of the 9 metrics (blacks perform worse with respect to unemployment and youth idleness). 

Note: One metric of SES on which blacks perform significantly worse is family structure (specifically, rates of single-mother households and out-of-wedlock births). This *particular* component of SES may play a stronger role in explaining black criminality (I will revisit this at the end of the post), but SES in general does not.

**United Kingdom**

Just like in the United States, blacks in the United Kingdom have far higher crime rates than Asians:

* [Crime statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606012412/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)] by the U.K.	 government show that for the three-year period year ending March 2017 to the year ending March 2019, blacks accounted for 18% of principal suspect of a homicide offense. This is despite the fact that they account for just 3.4% of the general population (figure 1 from the [United Kingdom Census 2011](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200613151047/https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest)]). For reference, Asians accounted for 9% of murder suspects despite being 7.5% of the population. This implies that the black murder rate is over 4 times the Asian murder rate in the U.K.
* According to [data from the UK Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)], the arrest rate for blacks (66.9 per 1,000) is 3 times higher than the arrest rate for Asians (22.9 per 1,000) and those categorized as “Chinese or Other” (20.9 per 1,000) [Table 3.12]. For comparison, the arrest rate for whites is 22.8 per 1,000. Table A shows that Asians, whites and those categorized as "Chinese or Other" are under-represented in arrests whereas blacks are significantly over-represented.
* [Data](https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023234/https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018)] from the Metropolitan Police Service shows that blacks (or “Afro-Caribbeans”) committed 4.2 times as many knife crimes as Asians (14,527 vs 3,443) in London during the years 2008-2018. This is despite the fact that there are 20-40% more Asian residents than black residents in London (based on [census data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London)] from 1991-2011). This implies that blacks are 5-6 times more likely to commit knife crimes than Asians in London.
* Finally, consider this [homicide dashboard](https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/homicide-dashboard/) published by the Metropolitan Police Service in the United Kingdom. The dashboard contains information on homicide victims and homicide offenders in London since 2003. During 2003-2019, black people committed 1,489 homicides out of a total of 3,635 (sum the B1, B2, and B9 codes), which means black people are responsible for 41% of homicides. Asians committed 525 homicides during this same period (sum the A1, A2, A3, A9, O1, and O9 codes). So blacks committed 7 times as many homicides as Asians. This is despite the fact that the Asian population has been 20-40% larger than the black population during this time (according to [London census data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London)] in 2001 and 2011). This implies that the black murder rate is at least 8 times the Asian murder rate in London.

Now, one might try to explain this by appealing to socioeconomicSES disparities between blacks and Asians. However, this is a poor explanation because of the following reasons:

* According to a [2019 report](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/income-distribution/latest) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200607184227/https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/income-distribution/latest)] on income from the UK government, black households receive similar incomes as Asian households. During the period of 2015-2018, the percentage of black households in the lowest 2 income quintiles (55%) was comparable to the percentage of Asian households in the bottom 2 quintiles (53%). In fact, there were slightly more Asian households in the bottom income quintile (31%) than Black households (30%). The report does find that blacks are slightly more likely to find themselves in the bottom income quintile after housing costs (33% vs 40%), but this cannot explain why the black murder rate is over 4 times the murder rate for Asians. So combining this data with earlier data regarding murder rates implies that *the black murder rate in the U.K. is over 5Combining this data with the earlier data on murder rates means that *the black murder rate in the U.K. is over 4 times the Asian murder rate despite the fact that blacks and Asians have similar probabilities of earning low incomes.*
* In London, Bangladeshi and Pakistani people are more likely to be low SES compared to blacks, yet they have far lower crime rates. According to [a 2017 report](https://trustforlondon.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/documents/LPP_2017_full_report.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200615063832/https://trustforlondon.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/documents/LPP_2017_full_report.pdf)] by Trust for London, the unemployment rate for Bangladeshi and Pakistani people (they were lumped into one group) was higher than the unemployment rate for blacks (46% vs 31%, pages 85-86), and the low pay rate for Bangladeshi and Pakistani people (46%, page 103) was higher than the low pay rate for blacks (46% vs 35%, page 103). However, according to the [homicide dashboard](https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/homicide-dashboard/) on London homicides during 2003-2019, black people committed 1,489 homicides, whereas Bangladeshi people committed just 103 homicides, and Pakistani committed just 77 homicides. Thus, black people committed 14.5 times as many homicides as Bangladeshi people and 19.3 times as many homicides as Pakistani people. In London, the black population is 4.9 times as large as both the Bangladeshi population (1,088,640 vs 222,127) and the Pakistani population (1,088,640 vs 223,797) (according to the [United Kingdom Census 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London)]). This means that *the black homicide rate is approximately 3 times the Bangladeshi homicide rate and 3.9 times the Pakistani homicide rate in London, despite the fact that the Bangladeshi and Pakistani population have lower pay and higher unemployment*.
* I'm unable to find nation-wide data on Bangladeshi and Pakistani criminality, but other evidence suggests that they are less likely to commit crimes than blacks despite their lower socioeconomic status. A [2008 report](https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/sites/crimeandjustice.org.uk/files/ETHNICITY%20HARM%20AND%20CRIME%20A%20DISCUSSION%20PAPER.pdf) published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies shows that Bangladeshi  and Pakistani people are more likely to be poor (Table A and Table B), and are more likely to be unemployed (Table C). Despite the socioeconomic disadvantages of Bangladeshi and Pakistani people, black children are far more likely to be permanently excluded from schools (Figure 1). Since childhood misconduct tends to predict adult criminality, I think it's reasonable to assume that blacks in the U.K. are much more likely to commit crimes than Bangladeshi and Pakistani people in the U.K., despite having a superior socioeconomic status.

**Canada**

Just like the United States and the United Kingdom, blacks in Canada have far higher crime rates than Asians. Also like the U.S. and U.K., these disparities in criminality cannot be explained by SES disparities. For example, in 2011 the incarceration rate for blacks was far higher than the incarceration rate for every group of Asians despite having higher median incomes:

* According to the [2011 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=), the median income for blacks (24,281) was higher than the median income for South Asians (23,340), Chinese (21,201), Southeast Asians (23,087), West Asians (17,656), and Korean (16,408). Asian groups that had higher median incomes were Filipinos (27,954) and Japanese people (29,112).
* A [2014 analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada) in *the Oxford Handbook of Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration* reported that the incarceration rate for blacks in 2011 was 3.36 times higher than the incarceration rate for the general population. The incarceration rate for Asians, South Asians, and West Asians was 0.45, 0.25, and 0.92 times (respectively) as high as the incarceration rate for the general population. This implies that the incarceration rate for blacks is 7.5, 13.4, and 3.7 times the incarceration rate for Asians, South Asians, and West Asians, respectively. *In 2011, blacks were substantially more likely to be incarcerated than South Asians and West Asians despite having a higher median income.*

Similar patterns can be found in 2004:
* A [2004 report](https://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/r144-eng.shtml) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200422231218/https://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/r144-eng.shtml)] by the Correctional Service of Canada found that there were 773 black people incarcertaed in the Canadian . "The Black offender group consisted of 773 participants. The Asian offender group was composed of 277 participants (88 Asiatic, 88 South East Asian, 50 South Asian, 45 Chinese, 4 Korean, and 2 Japanese offenders)." According to [the 2001 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/English/census01/products/standard/themes/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=1&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=1&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=65795&PRID=0&PTYPE=55430&S=0&SHOWALL=No&SUB=0&Temporal=2006&THEME=44&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20181204162046/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/English/census01/products/standard/themes/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=1&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=1&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=65795&PRID=0&PTYPE=55430&S=0&SHOWALL=No&SUB=0&Temporal=2006&THEME=44&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)], the population sizes for blacks, South East Asians, South Asians, and Chinese was 662,215, 198,880, 917,075, and 1,029,395 (respectively). Thus, the offender rate ratio compared to South East Asians, South Asians, and the Chinese was 2.6, 21, and 26.7 (respectively). 
* Also the Asian population at the time was at least 3.5 times the size of the black population (662,215 blacks vs at least 2,319,325 Chinese, South Asian, South East Asian, Korean, and Japanese people). Which means the offense rate was at least for blacks was at least 9 times the offense rate for Asians.
* According to the [2001 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170717211008/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)], the low-income incidence rate for blacks (50.6%) was lower or comparable to every Asian group:  Chinese (55.2%), South Asian (50.3%), Filipino (47.9%), Southeast Asian (50.7%), West Asian (57.7%), Korean (72.5%), and Japanese (49.4%).

## Studies involving SES

### Direct controls on SES

I only know of 3 studies that directly compared the criminality of blacks and whites within the same SES bracket. Each study finds that substantial disparities in criminality of blacks persist after controlling for SES:

* [Levitt 1999](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittTheChangingRelationship1999.pdf) found "The most striking feature of Table 4 are the enormous differences between whites and blacks. Twenty-five percent of whites in all time periods lived in neighborhoods where not a single white homicide victimization occurred over the course of a decade. Even the most dangerous neighborhoods for whites experienced homicide rates of only about 10 per 100,000, about one-fourth the median homicide rate among blacks. Black residents in the highest risk neighborhoods were murdered at rates about ten times greater than whites in the most dangerous white neighborhoods" 
* [Gjelsvik et al. 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455929/pdf/11524_2006_Article_337.pdf) reported "For all men combined, there was a trend of increasing homicide risk as block-group socioeconomic conditions moved down the gradient (Fig. 1). Race-specific patterns also showed this trend. However, except for proportion of female-headed households, white men had not only a substantially lower risk of homicide compared to black and Hispanic men within the same block-group socioeconomic level, but also the highest risk for white men (over all socioeconomic levels) was still substantially lower than the lowest risk of homicide for black and Hispanic men (over all socioeconomic levels) (Table 1). " 
* [Zaw et al. 2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20190125064658/https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/wealthraceincarcerationrates.pdf) found that "Between races, we find that at low levels of wealth both blacks and Hispanics still had a higher incarceration rate than whites. At higher levels of wealth at the baseline, although the black-white incarceration disparity was reduced for males, it was not eliminated." 

### Reviews

Consider state-by-state variations in crime rates. The proportion of a state's population that is black correlates very highly with the violent crime rate in that state. This should not be surprising, since black people disproportionately commit crime. However, if racial disparities in crime are the result of racial disparities in socioeconomic status, (SES) then one would expect that the SES-crime correlation across states would be stronger than the black-crime correlation. It turns out that this is not what we find. The association between crime and the percent black of a state is *larger* than the association between crime and most traditional measures of SES. Consider the following:
* [Rubenstein 2005](http://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2005-Color-of-Crime-Report.pdf) measures how the violent crime rate in a state (or Washingont D.C.) is correlated with various variables such as poverty, unemployment, percent of population that is black/Hispanic, and percent of population that has not completed high school. He finds that finds that the correlation between violent crime rate and percent black/Hispanic (r=0.81) is far larger than the correlation between violent crime rate and poverty (r=0.36), unemployment (r=0.35), and percent that has not completed high school (r=0.37) (Figures 14-17).
* [Templer and Rushton 2011](https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IQ-Skin-Color-Crime-HIV-AIDS-and-Income-in-50-U.S.-States-2011-by-Donald-I.-Templer-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf) report similar findings when investigating crime rates across the 50 states of the country (so not including Washington D.C.). They also find that the correlation between the percent black and murder rate is extremely large (r=0.81). Murder was found to be more strongly associated with percent black than with IQ (r=0.54), life expectancy (r=-0.61), or income (r=-0.40).

The classic work on structural correlates on crime is [Land, McCall, and Cohen 1990](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247657745_Structural_Covariates_of_Homicide_Rates_Are_There_Any_Invariances_Across_Time_and_Social_Space). Here are some of the main findings: 
* Researchers reviewed 21 studies, and 44 models that investigated various covariates and homicide. Percent black was associated with homicide more consistently than any other covariate. Table 1 shows that: 86% (38/44) of the models found a significant positive association between homicide and percent black. For comparison, 69% (22/32) of the models found a significant positive association with poverty, 29% (8/28) found a significant positive association with income inequality, 20% (1/5) found a significant negative association with median family income, and 0% (0/9) found a significant positive association with unemployment. 
* The study also found that, in 1980, percentage black had a stronger effect on a city's or metropolitan area's homicide rate than any other variable (Table 2). The other variables were percentage divorced, percentage of kids not with both parents, median family income, percentage families below poverty, gini index, and unemployment rate.
* In another model, the researchers combined various covariates into a single variable: median family income, the percentage of families in poverty, income inequality, percentage of population that is black, the percentage of children not living with both parents were all combined into a single variable: *resource deprivation/afluence component*. In this new model, unsurprisingly, the *resource deprivation/afluence* variable had the strongest association with homicides. However, the researchers note, "Among these elements, the single element that is most consistently (although not invariably, as documented earlier in tables 1 and 2) associated with homicide rates is the percentage of the population of a city, metropolitan area, or state that is black" (page 954).
* An update to the paper was released 20 years later: [McCall et al. (2010)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6398/d079c3099c17b02eea5e8e07e459fbd4c37d.pdf) 

Other studies had similar findings:

*  [Kposowa, Breault, and Harrison 1995](http://www.jstor.org/stable/591624?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) found similar results. Table I presents regression estimates for counties with populations in excess of 100,000 in 1980. The results were that percentage black was by far the best predictor of homicides. The regression between homicide and percent black (0.739) was larger than the regression between homicide and poverty (-0.119), gini (0.177), divorce (0.187), density (0.126), unemployment (-0.026), and education (-0.027). The variable with the second largest association with homicide was percent hispanic (0.265). Table II shows that percent black was also the strongest predictor of homicides in counties under 25,000 population. Finally, when considering all counties together, percent black was found to be the strongest predictor of homicides (0.363, Table V) and violent crime (0.369, Table IV), but not property crimes (0.178, Table III).
* [Pratt and Cullen 2005](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Travis_Pratt/publication/284966231_Assessing_the_relative_effects_of_macro-level_predictors_of_crime_A_meta-analysis/links/5aa01b330f7e9badd9a08dde/Assessing-the-relative-effects-of-macro-level-predictors-of-crime-A-meta-analysis.pdf) meta-analyzed 162 studies that investigated the relationship between a region's crime rates and 34 variables, including percent black. 72% of said studies found a significant positive association, with an average effect size of .294. Among the variables with at least 15 studies, only 2 variables had a stronger effect size (incarceration effect and percent nonwhite which had effect sizes of -0.332 and 0.328, respectively), and only 3 variables were found to have a significant effect in a larger proportion of studies (racial heterogeneity, percent nonwhite, and social support/altruism were found to have a significant effect in 72.83%, 76.38%, and 74.47% of studies). Percent black had a larger average effect size and was more consistently significantly associated with crime when compared to poverty, inequality, socioeconomic status, and unemployment.
* [Worrall 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19086115/) states "Racial composition and unemployment have appeared as either theoretically-relevant controls or variables of substantive interest in numerous studies of crime. While there is no clear consensus in the literature as to their statistical significance, the lack of consensus has been most apparent in panel analyses with unit fixed effects. One explanation for this is that racial composition and unemployment are fairly invariant, or slow-moving, which leads to collinearity with unit dummies. A number of pertinent studies are reviewed to illustrate how two slow-moving variables, percent black and percent unemployed, have behaved inconsistently. A fixed effects vector decomposition procedure [Plumper, V., Troeger, V. E., 2007. Efficient estimation of time-invariant and rarely changing variables in finite sample panel analyses with unit fixed effects. Political Analysis, 15, 124-139.] is used to illustrate how these variables' coefficients appear positive and significant when the slow-moving process is accounted for". 

**A more granular unit of analysis** 

* [Shihadeh and Shrum (2004)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732170490459502) - find a large, significant effect of % black on crime rates, but this became statistically insignificant when controlling for socioeconomic, structural, and demographic variables. It focuses on crime only in Baton Rouge. It differs from other studies in that it uses blocks as the unity of analysis as opposed to cities or metropolitan areas.
* [Peterson and Krivo (2009)](https://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) use the neighborhood as the unit of analysis. "Our analysis is restricted to 8286 census tracts (i.e., neighborhoods) across eighty-seven cities for which complete information is available for the set of violent crimes analyzed here". Finds that controlling for residential instability, residential loans, immigration, and disadvantage reduces the crime in black areas to crime in white area ratio from 4.29 to 1.78, accounting for about 76% of the crime disparity.  "Disadvantage is an index (average z-scores) of the extent of joblessness, professional or managerial occupations (reverse coded), high school graduates (reverse coded), female-headed families, secondary sector workers (those in the six occupations with the lowest average incomes), and poverty."
* [Feldmeyer et al., (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111273/) - attempts to find various confounding variables in the percent black-crime association, however the relationship persisted beyond these variables. Before controlling for confounding, they found a correlation of 0.438 between homicide rate and percent black, 0.513 between robbery rate and percent black, 0.304 between rape rate and percent black, and 0.199 between aggravated assault rate and percent black. 
	* The study still found that controlling for structural disadvantage did not eliminate the entire gap.
	* Uses "census places" as from California and New York the spatial unit of analysis.
	* Also, in the introduction section, gives a good review of literature since Land (1990).

Review:
* Neighborhood disadvantage is more imortant than count/city/household SES.
* Though we need more studies to confirm this link. Not clear if controlling for structural disadvantage accounts for the disparities in crime. Studies are mixed.
* At best, controlling for neighborhood disadvantage probably accounts for a significant proportion of the the disparities in crime.
* Insofar as structural disadvantage accounts for crime disparities, that doesn't imply that structural disadvantage causes crime (because it may be confounded with another variable that explains crime disparities, e.g. IQ disparities).
* Even if structural disadvantage is causal, what explains lower structural disadvantage?

Other unanswered questions:
* What explains black misconduct among children?
* What explains blacks criminality outside of the United States, in places where they are no more poor than other groups, yet have substantially higher crime rates?
* What explains elevated black criminality compared to other disadvantaged groups? (even granting that controlling fro disadvantage eliminates the disparity in crime)
* What explains why blacks tend to find themselves in poor neighborhoods?

## Causes

Factors:

Personal:
* Intelligence
* Impulsivity
* Single-parent motherhood
* Parenting

Concentrated neighborhood disadvantage:
* Poverty/income
* Unemployment
* Single-parent motherhood
* Education (HS/college graduates)

Ranking the importance:
* Intelligence is most important
	* It directly predicts crime
	* It predicts income/poverty, unemployment and education, which predicts crime
	* Correlates strongly with self-control (though self-control is still independently important)
	* Most important because it is not caused by any of the other variables (though maybe parenting)
* Self-control
	* is separate because it is predictive independently of IQ
* Single-parent households
	* is separate because it is not predicted by IQ (for blacks)
	* also predicts household poverty
* Parenting
	* is separate because it is obviously predictive indeendently of IQ
	* 

### Intelligence

Virtues:
* Explains misconduct among children
* Explains black criminality outside of the United States
* Explains black criminality compared to other disadvantaged groups
* Explains why blacks find themselves in poor neighborhoods

Evidence seems to suggest that the majority of the black-white gap in criminality can be explained by the black-white gap in intelligence (as measured by IQ tests). Research on race and IQ has fairly consistently shown that the average IQ score for Blacks in the US is about one standard deviation (about 15 points) lower than the average IQ score for Whites ([Neisser et al. 1996](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200531161409/http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf)], page 93). Studies usually put the average Black IQ slightly above 85 and the average White IQ slightly above 100. 

* We also know that having a low IQ makes someone much more likely to engage in criminality. [Gottfredson (1998)](https://analyseeconomique.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-general-intelligence-factor.pdf) notes that youths with IQ of 75–90 are seven times more likely to be incarcerated than those with IQ of 110–125. She also notes that ‘‘no other trait or circumstance yet studied is so deeply implicated in the nexus of bad social outcomes - poverty, welfare, illegitimacy and educational failure - that entraps many low-IQ individuals and families."
* [Beaver et al. 2013](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Intelligence-is-associated-with-criminal-justice-Beaver-Schwartz/3df27bf46efc05593295dede96227d454985878e) investigated whether IQ influenced the probability of being arrested and incarcerated for blacks and whites. The study finds "When combined with previous literature, there is good reason to believe that IQ is related to criminal involvement regardless of the sample analyzed, the measurement of crime, and the inclusion of controls for potentially confounding factors, such as executive functions. There is likely not another individuallevel variable that is so consistently associated with crime and other forms of antisocial behaviors than IQ" (page 285). The study finds that IQ has significant impacts on the likelihood of arrests and incarceration for both blacks and whites.
* [Murray and Herrnstein (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)] test the degree to which the crime gap is eliminated after controlling for IQ. They find that, among 29-year-olds, 13% of Blacks had ever been interviewed in a correctional facility (a proxy for incarceration) compared to 2% of Whites. Among 29-year-olds of average IQ (IQ=100), the number drops to 5% for Blacks and 2% for Whites (page 338). So controlling for IQ reduces the incarceration disparity from 11 percentage points to just 3 percentage points, accounting for 73% of the gap.

Earlier data suggests that some of the black-white crime gap may be the result of SES disparities between blacks and whites. This may be true. However, the SES disparities between blacks and whites are largely the result of the black-white IQ gap. Plenty of studies have shown that differences in earnings between blacks and whites are mostly eliminated after controlling for IQ:

-   Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) allows us to examine the effect that IQ has on the wage gap between Blacks and Whites born between 1957 and 1964. The NLSY required participants to take the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), which, like most cognitive tests, can be used as a proxy for IQ (correlation between AFQT and IQ = 0.8). After controlling for age and AFQT scores,  [Johnson and Neal (1998)](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~wrj8y/finaljencks.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20181221010750/http://www.people.virginia.edu/~wrj8y/finaljencks.pdf)] found that AFQT disparities explain about two-thirds of the wage gap for young men and all of the gap for young women. The wage gap reduces from 24% to 9% for men after controlling for IQ. For young women, Black women go from a 17% disadvantage to a 5%  _advantage_  after controlling for AFQT scores (page 4). Assuming black men and black women represent roughly equal shares of the black labor force, controlling for AFQT scores reduces the wage gap from about 21.5% to 2% (averaging the figures above), accounting for about 90% of the wage gap. Also, see  [Neal and Johnson 1996](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/Neal%20and%20Johnson%20(1996).pdf)  for an alternative article reporting on the same experiment.
-   Using the same dataset,  [Jencks and Phillips (1998)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200428215546/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)] (page 6) report that, among men who scored above the 50th percentile on the AFQT, the average Black male earns 96% of the average White male after controlling for age, and the racial wage gap is reversed for women. Thus, the wage gap is virtually eliminated without even controlling for geography, education, parental socioeconomic status, or even occupation.  [O’Neill 1990](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4726239_The_Role_of_Human_Capital_in_Earnings_Differences_Between_Black_and_White_Men)  finds similar results.
-   Pew Research released  [data](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/empreportsupward20intergen20mobility2008530pdf.pdf)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200516151458/https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/EMPReportsUpward20Intergen20Mobility2008530pdf.pdf)] showing that about 75% of Whites born into the bottom quintile of income transition out of that quintile, whereas only about 56% of Blacks do the same (figures 3a and 3b). However, among those with a median AFQT score (a proxy for IQ), there is almost no difference in the likelihood of transitioning out of the bottom quintile – 81% for Whites and 78% for Blacks (figure 13). So, the relative lack of economic mobility for Blacks is mostly the result of the relative lack of cognitive ability.
- [Murray and Herrnstein (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)  [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)] used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to find that 90% of the wage gap is erased after controlling for IQ. Controlling only for age, the mean black worker’s wages are 80% of the mean white worker’s wages. After controlling for age and IQ, the mean black worker's wages becomes 98% of the mean white worker's wages. On the other hand, controlling for age, education and parental SES (but not IQ), brings the number up to only 86% (page 324).

Therefore, insofar as the the black-white crime gap is due to the black-white SES gap, this is ultimately due to the black-white IQ gap, since the black-white SES gap is mostly the result of the black-white IQ gap.

### Time-preference

Virtues:
* Explains misconduct among children
* Explains black criminality outside of the United States
* Explains black criminality compared to other disadvantaged groups

Time-preference involves exercising delayed gratification. The capacity to delay gratification is a form of self-control, which is another psychological trait that predicts criminality even after controlling for IQ. 
* [Moffitt et al. 2010](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/7/2693.full.pdf) has shown that low self-control predicts criminality and poverty even after controlling for IQ and parental socio-economic status. We also know that blacks and whites have different levels of self-control. There have been studies that haeve demonstrated deficiencies in self-control among children and adults, with in the United States and in other countries. 
* Include study on time-preference and criminality

Why we know that blacks have higher time-preferences

* [Castillo, Ferraro, Jordan, and Petrie 2011](https://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/06/11/racial-differences-in-self-control/Castillo,%20Ferraro,%20Jordan,%20and%20Petrie%20(2011)) had a sample consisting of 82% of the student population of 4 middle schools in a poor Georgia school district. They ran an experiment to measure self-control among black and white students. They say “In our experiment, subjects are asked, orally and in writing, to make twenty decisions in total. For each decision, subjects are asked if they would prefer $49 one month from now or $49+$X seven months from now. The amount of money, $X, is strictly positive and increases over the twenty decisions.” Using this design, they were able to measure at what point people began to prefer the later reward and, thus, the strength of their preference for immediate gratification. Blacks were found to have significantly less self-control than Whites.
* [Wany, Rieger, and Hens (2011)](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1481443) utilized a sample of 5,291 university students from 45 countries and gave participants a chance to choose an immediate monetary reward or a larger long term reward. The chart below shows the proportion of people from different regions that chose the larger and less immediate reward.

This pattern also applies to adults in the United States:
* [Borgo (2013)](http://www.iza.org/conference_files/SUMS_2013/dal_borgo_m5011.pdf) looked at data on 25,820 American households and found that Black homes had lower savings rates than White homes even after controlling for differences in income, age, family size, education, region of residence, and marriage. Normally, using savings rates as a measure of self-control would be problematic because it is obviously easier to save money if you have a large income, but this study utilized an impressive set of controls and so can be taken as a valid measure of self-control.
* More luxory goods purchased by blacks despite lower income


### Single parent motherhood

Virtues:
* Explains misconduct among children
* Explains black criminality compared to other disadvantaged groups

One of the direct variables that are used to control for SES 
* [Harper and McLanahan 2004](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.519.2721&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* [Maginnis 1997](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=167327) "the most reliable indicator of violent crime in a community is the proportion of fatherless families."

Controlling for family structure eliminates gap in crime?: https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/2015/11/16/racial-differences-in-homicide-rates-are-poorly-explained-by-economics/

Of course, this doesn't prove that family structure explains the crime disparities (e.g. family structure is confounded with genetics and possibly other factors).

But it does allow as a possible CANDIDATE for an explanation.

**Canada**

Just like the United States and the United Kingdom, blacks in Canada have far higher crime rates than Asians. Also like the U.S. and U.K., these disparities in criminality cannot be explained by SES disparities. For example, in 2014 the incarceration rate for blacks was far higher than the incarceration rate for every group of Asians despite having higher median incomes:

* According to the [2011 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170717211008/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)], the median income for blacks (24,281) was higher than the median income for South Asians (23,340), Chinese (21,201), Southeast Asians (23,087), West Asians (17,656), and Korean (16,408). Asian groups that had higher median incomes were Filipinos (27,954) and Japanese people (29,112).
* A [2014 analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada)] in *the Oxford Handbook of Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration* reported that the incarceration rate for blacks in 2011 was 3.36 times higher than the incarceration rate for the general population. The incarceration rate for Asians, South Asians, and West Asians was 0.45, 0.25, and 0.92 times (respectively) as high as the incarceration rate for the general population. This implies that the incarceration rate for blacks is 7.5, 13.4, and 3.7 times the incarceration rate for Asians, South Asians, and West Asians, respectively. *In 2011, blacks were substantially more likely to be incarcerated than South Asians and West Asians despite having a higher median income.*

Similar patterns can be found in 2004:
* A [2004 report](https://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/r144-eng.shtml) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200422231218/https://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/research/r144-eng.shtml)] by the Correctional Service of Canada found that there were 773 black people incarcerated in the Federal Canadian Correctional System. "The Black offender group consisted of 773 participants. The Asian offender group was composed of 277 participants (88 Asiatic, 88 South East Asian, 50 South Asian, 45 Chinese, 4 Korean, and 2 Japanese offenders)." According to [the 2001 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/English/census01/products/standard/themes/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=1&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=1&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=65795&PRID=0&PTYPE=55430&S=0&SHOWALL=No&SUB=0&Temporal=2006&THEME=44&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20181204162046/https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/English/census01/products/standard/themes/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=1&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=1&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=65795&PRID=0&PTYPE=55430&S=0&SHOWALL=No&SUB=0&Temporal=2006&THEME=44&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)], the population sizes for blacks, South East Asians, South Asians, and Chinese was 662,215, 198,880, 917,075, and 1,029,395 (respectively). Thus, the offender rate for black people was 2.6, 21, and 26.7 times (respectively) the offender rate for South East Asians, South Asians, and the Chinese people.
* Also the Asian population at the time was at least 3.5 times the size of the black population (662,215 blacks vs at least 2,319,325 Chinese, South Asian, South East Asian, Korean, and Japanese people). Which means the offender rate for blacks was at least 9 times the offender rate for Asians overall (there were 2.8 times as many black offenders as Asian offenders, despite the Asian population being at least 3.5 times the size of the black population).
* According to the [2001 Canadian Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170717211008/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=0&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=106746&PRID=0&PTYPE=105277&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2013&THEME=98&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=)], the low-income incidence rate for blacks (50.6%) was lower or comparable to every Asian group:  Chinese (55.2%), South Asian (50.3%), Filipino (47.9%), Southeast Asian (50.7%), West Asian (57.7%), Korean (72.5%), and Japanese (49.4%).

In conclusion, we find that blacks tend to have far higher rates of criminality than many other non-white racial groups in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. This is despite the fact that they have superior or similar SES levels compared to many of these racial groups (the one exception may be single-mother household rates for which blacks do perform significantly worse). So we should be skeptical that SES is a significant explanation of black criminality, since these other low-SES groups do not have comparable rates of criminality.

Note: as stated above, one metric of SES on which blacks perform significantly worse is family structure (specifically rates of single-mother households and out-of-wedlock births). This may play a stronger role in explaining black criminality. Again, I will revisit this topic at the end of the post.

## Studies on the relationship between SES and black criminality

The previous section only provided reason to be *skeptical* of SES-based explanations of black criminality. This section provides studies that attempt to more rigorously examine the relationship between SES and black criminality. The general trend is that crime is more strongly associated with the presence of blacks than it is with low-SES conditions. Findings appear to be quite mixed on whether controlling for SES eliminates most of the association between race and crime.  

**Race vs other covariates with crime**

If black criminality was mainly the result of SES, then one would expect that the crime-SES correlation across states would be stronger than the crime-black correlation (i.e. the correlation between a state's crime rate and percentage of the population that is black) across states. It turns out that this is not what we find. The crime-black association is consistently found to be stronger than crime-SES association:

* [Rubenstein (2005)](http://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2005-Color-of-Crime-Report.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200620230504/http://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2005-Color-of-Crime-Report.pdf)] measures how the violent crime rate in a state (or Washington D.C.) correlates with various variables such as poverty, unemployment, high school completion rate, and percent of population that is black/Hispanic. The finding was that the correlation between violent crime rate and percent black/Hispanic (r=0.81) is far larger than the correlation between violent crime rate and poverty (r=0.36), unemployment (r=0.35), and percent that has not completed high school (r=0.37) (Figures 14-17).
* [Templer and Rushton (2011)](https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IQ-Skin-Color-Crime-HIV-AIDS-and-Income-in-50-U.S.-States-2011-by-Donald-I.-Templer-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170304173924/http://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IQ-Skin-Color-Crime-HIV-AIDS-and-Income-in-50-U.S.-States-2011-by-Donald-I.-Templer-John-Philippe-Rushton.pdf)] report similar findings when investigating crime rates across the 50 states of the country. They find that the correlation between the percent black and murder rate is extremely large (r=0.81), larger than the correlation between murder and IQ (r=0.54), life expectancy (r=-0.61), or income (r=-0.40).

The classic work on structural correlates on crime is [Land, McCall, and Cohen (1990)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247657745_Structural_Covariates_of_Homicide_Rates_Are_There_Any_Invariances_Across_Time_and_Social_Space) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200616045036/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247657745_Structural_Covariates_of_Homicide_Rates_Are_There_Any_Invariances_Across_Time_and_Social_Space)]. Researchers reviewed 44 models across 21 studies that investigated the relationship between homicide and various covariates. Here are some of the main findings: 
* Percent black was associated with homicide more consistently than any other covariate. Table 1 shows that: 86% (38/44) of the models found a significant positive association between homicide and percent black. For comparison, 69% (22/32) of the models found a significant positive association with poverty, 29% (8/28) found a significant positive association with income inequality, 20% (1/5) found a significant negative association with median family income, and 0% (0/9) found a significant positive association with unemployment. 
* In 1980, percentage black had a stronger effect on a city's or metropolitan area's homicide rate than any other variable (Table 2). The other variables were percentage divorced, percentage of kids not with both parents, median family income, percentage families below poverty, gini index, and unemployment rate.
* The authors of the study created another modal that combined various covariates into a single variable: median family income, the percentage of families in poverty, income inequality, percentage of population that is black, and the percentage of children not living with both parents. This new variable was called the *resource deprivation/affluence component*. Unsurprisingly, the *resource deprivation/affluence* variable had the strongest association with homicides compared to all other variables used. However, the researchers note that "among these elements, the single element that is most consistently (although not invariably, as documented earlier in tables 1 and 2) associated with homicide rates is the percentage of the population of a city, metropolitan area, or state that is black" (page 954).
* An update to the paper was released 20 years later: [McCall et al. (2010)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6398/d079c3099c17b02eea5e8e07e459fbd4c37d.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190601053740/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6398/d079c3099c17b02eea5e8e07e459fbd4c37d.pdf)]

Other studies had similar findings:

*  [Kposowa, Breault, and Harrison (1995)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/591624?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) found similar results. Table I presents OLS regression estimates between homicide and other covariates for counties with populations in excess of 100,000 in 1980. The regression results results indicate that the standardized coefficient between homicides and percentage black (0.739) was stronger than the association between homicide and poverty (-0.119), gini (0.177), divorce (0.187), density (0.126), unemployment (-0.026), and education (-0.027). The variable with the second largest association with homicide was percent hispanic (0.265). Table II shows that percent black was also the strongest predictor of homicides in counties under 25,000 population. Finally, when considering all counties together, percent black was found to be the strongest predictor of homicides (standardize regression coefficient=0.363, Table V) and violent crime (0.369, Table IV), but not property crimes (0.178, Table III).

Among the variables with at least 15 studies, only 2 variables had a stronger effect size (incarceration effect and percent non-white which had effect sizes of -0.332 and 0.328, respectively), and only 3 variables were found to have a significant effect in a larger proportion of studies (racial heterogeneity, percent non-white, and social support/altruism were found to have a significant effect in 72.83%, 76.38%, and 74.47% of studies). Percent black had a larger average effect size and was more consistently significantly associated with crime than poverty, inequality, socioeconomic status, and unemployment.

**Wealthy blacks vs poor whites**

The above studies do not *prove* that black criminality is not ultimately the result of low-SES, but they do provide reason to be skeptical of any such claims. To make more decisive claims about whether black criminality is the result of SES, we should consider studies that directly compare criminality between blacks and non-blacks in similar SES conditions.

One such study is [Zaw et al. (2016)](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/wealthraceincarcerationrates.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190125064658/https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/wealthraceincarcerationrates.pdf)] where researchers examined the impact of race and wealth on the probability of being incarcerated. The study reveals that black males are more likely to be incarcerated than white males at nearly every wealth bracket (Figure 2b). The only exception is the highest wealth bracket, but as the study notes "given the small sample sizes, this finding is inconclusive" (page 108). The study reports found that "at low levels of wealth both blacks and Hispanics still had a higher incarceration rate than whites. At higher levels of wealth at the baseline, although the black-white incarceration disparity was reduced for males, it was not eliminated" (page 112). 

Keep in mind that incarceration rates are a good indicator of criminality, as I've demonstrated in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/)).

**A more granular unit of analysis** 

One criticism of some of the above studies is that the unit of analysis is too broad (e.g. data is aggregated at the city or state level). Other studies attempt to overcome these issues by using data aggregated at more granular levels, e.g. at the neighborhood or block level. Some of these studies show that, at these more granular levels of analysis, the relationship between race and criminality is completely or mostly accounted for after controlling for SES:

* [Shihadeh and Shrum (2004)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02732170490459502) examined the relationship between SES, race, and crime on block groups in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The researchers find that, before controlling for any other factors, race is the "strongest and most consistent predictor of serious crime rates, with the exception of rape and larceny theft" (page 522). However, they find that controlling for economic disadvantage, social disorganization, and other background characteristics "eliminates the effect of race on crime rates" (page 524).
* [Peterson and Krivo (2009)](https://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200212001416/http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf)] analyzed 8286 neighborhoods across 87 cities "for which complete information is available for the set of violent crimes analyzed here" (page 916). The study finds that controlling for residential instability, residential loans, immigration, and "disadvantage" reduces the ratio of black violent crime rate to white violent crime rate from 4.29 to 1.78 (Table 2), accounting for about 76% of the racial crime disparity. The authors measure "disadvantage" as "the extent of joblessness, professional or managerial occupations (reverse coded), high school graduates (reverse coded), female-headed families, secondary sector workers (those in the six occupations with the lowest average incomes), and poverty" (page 917).

Note that in the Peterson and Krivo (2009) study, blacks are still nearly 2 times as likely to commit violent crimes as whites after accounting for the controls. Nevertheless, the controls do account for a significant degree of the racial disparity in violent crime. 

However, other studies find conflicting results. These following studies find that, even with more granular levels of analysis, the relationship between race and criminality persists even after controlling for SES:

* [Levitt (1999)](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittTheChangingRelationship1999.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200611040559/http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittTheChangingRelationship1999.pdf)] explored the relationship between race, income, and homicides in Chicago neighborhoods. The study found that, during 1986-1995 (the latest time period available), the homicide rate for black residents in neighborhoods with the *highest incomes* was about 3 times higher than the homicide rate for white residents in neighborhoods at *all income levels* (Table 6). The study also notes (page 92) "even the most dangerous neighborhoods for whites experienced homicide rates of only about 10 per 100,000, about one-fourth the median homicide rate among blacks."
* [Gjelsvik et al. (2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455929/pdf/11524_2006_Article_337.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200624040744/http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC3455929&blobtype=pdf)] investigated the risk of homicide victimization among black, Hispanic, and white men by block group-level SES characteristics in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The study reports (page 706) that "except for proportion of female-headed households, white men had not only a substantially lower risk of homicide compared to black and Hispanic men within the same block-group socioeconomic level, but also the highest risk for white men (over all socioeconomic levels) was still substantially lower than the lowest risk of homicide for black and Hispanic men (over all socioeconomic levels) (Table 1)." Table 1 shows that the estimated risk for homicide of black men is over 10 times higher than the risk for white men among nearly every SES bracket.
* [Feldmeyer et al. (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111273/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609062223/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111273/)] analyzes the relationship between race, crime, and other covariates in census places in California and New York. The study finds that, for small census places, "racial/ethnic composition effects on violence are largely nonsignificant after accounting for concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility, and other structural and demographic characteristics of census places." However, while structural controls can account for the association between race and crime in smaller areas, this is not true for larger areas. Specifically, the authors report that their findings "provide consistent evidence that black and to a lesser extent Latino population concentration in larger places is linked to higher levels of violence, and that these effects cannot be fully accounted for with structural controls."

So perhaps controlling for SES at the *neighborhood* level (as opposed to the household, city, or state level) may reduce racial disparities in criminality. While this is certainly possible, studies appear to be mixed, with many studies finding *strong*, persistent associations between race and crime even after controlling for SES. The truth is probably that controlling for neighborhood SES can reduce a considerable portion of disproportionate black criminality, but it probably will not eliminate gap completely.

## Final problems with SES-based explanations of black criminality

I will end by revealing a broader problem with using some of the above studies to conclude that SES is a significant cause of black criminality. Even *if* controlling for SES reduces a significant portion of black criminality, this does not entail that SES is a significant *cause* of black criminality. This would merely demonstrate a statistical *association* between SES black criminality. But this association could very well be [spurious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship) rather than causal, i.e. there could be some third variable X that is causally responsible for both the SES gap and the crime gap. If so, then controlling for SES would implicitly control for X, which means the reduction in the crime gap would be *caused* by controlling for X (not by controlling for SES). If such a variable existed, then X would be the cause of the crime gap, not the SES gap. 

I believe we have very good evidence that X *does* exist: X is intelligence (as measured by IQ tests). The *IQ gap* explains why blacks find themselves in low-SES neighborhoods and why they exhibit high levels of criminality. It is low-IQ, not low-SES, that is largely responsible for black criminality. The reason that controlling for SES reduces the crime gap is that controlling for SES implicitly controls for IQ (since high-IQ individuals tend to be higher SES).

I will go into more detail - and provide evidence - on the role of IQ in explaining black criminality in a future post. For now, I'll just explain why the IQ gap has more explanatory power than the SES gap as a cause of the crime gap. Firstly, the extreme levels of black criminality in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom (where blacks do not have extremely low SES) cannot be explained by the SES gap, but they can be explained by the IQ gap. Secondly, positing the SES gap as the explanation for black criminality does not explain *why* blacks consistently find themselves in low-SES neighborhoods and households, whereas the IQ gap can perfectly explain this phenomenon (low IQ groups tend to lack the skills necessary to avoid low SES circumstances). Therefore, even if the SES gap *does* have some small causal impact on the crime gap, the IQ gap would nevertheless be the *ultimate* cause, since the racial IQ gap is the cause of the racial SES gap as I have shown in a [previous post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/).

The one exception here may be racial differences in family structure, e.g. rates of single-mother households and out-of-wedlock birth rates. Family structure has a significant impact on criminality, and racial differences in family structure are not accounted for by controlling for IQ (as I have shown in a [previous post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/)). So differences in family structure may be a significant cause of black criminality independently of the IQ gap. I will go into more detail on the causal importance of family structure in a future post.
