# Police killings and black criminality

In light of the killing of George Floyd, there has been much discussion regarding anti-black bias in the criminal justice system (CJS) in the United States. It seems to me that the mainstream assumption is that the disproportionate police killings of black people is strong evidence of an anti-black bias in the CJS. My goal in this post is to refute this assumption. I believe that an honest and impartial assessment of all of the relevant data provides strong reason to *deny* that the disproportionate police killings of blacks is evidence of anti-black bias. I will argue that the best explanation of disproportionate police killings against blacks doesn't involve any appeal to an anti-black bias. That explanation consists in the fact that black people disproportionately engage in criminal activity and the fact that the police disproportionately kill criminals.

My argument will proceed in the following stages. First, I will detail the degree to which blacks are disproportionately killed by the police. Then I argue that the disproportionate killings can be adequately explained by disproportionate black criminality with no reason to appeal to an anti-black bias with the CJS. I show this by citing statistics on disproportionate black criminality, by citing studies that demonstrate the relationship between levels of violent crime and police killings, and by citing studies that fail to detect any anti-black bias in policing. This evidence provides, I believe, strong reason to believe that disproportionate police killings of blacks is the result of disproportionate black criminality, not an anti-black bias.

However, to demonstrate my primary claim, it is not sufficient to merely show that disproportionate police killings of blacks is the result of disproportionate black criminality. Some people assume that disproportionate black criminality is *caused by* anti-black bias in the CJS. I need to challenge this assumption as well in order to demonstrate my claim. So, in the second half of this post, I will provide evidence that disproportionate black criminality is *not* caused by anti-black bias in the CJS. My argument for this will proceed in the following stages. First, I debunk a few common claims of anti-black bias within the CJS. Second, I show that similar levels of disproportionate criminality and misconduct is found among blacks who have never interacted with the United States CJS. This demonstrates that there are factors independent of the U.S. CJS that cause the levels of black criminality that we find in the United States. This post is agnostic with respect to what these factors are, but these factors (whatever they may be) can plausibly explain black criminality within the United States without involving any anti-black bias.

## Disproportionate police killings of blacks

First, let's understand the degree to which blacks are disproportionately killed by the police:

* A [2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200601220156/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/)] that analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System showed that, in 17 U.S. States during 2009-2012, victims of police killings were majority white (52%) but disproportionately black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among blacks than whites:
* Statistics published by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606135907/https://www.statista.com/statistics/585152/people-shot-to-death-by-us-police-by-race/)] show blacks comprised 24% of all people shot to death by the police in 2018 (359 out of 965).
* Similar findings are reported by [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200607161849/https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/)], a website that tracks police killings in the country using the most popular crowdsourced databases. The report shows that black people were 24% of those killed by the police, and that they are about 3 times more likely to be killed by the police than white people.

It is also worth noting that the nifty the tool at [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/nationaltrends) shows that the rate of police killings against blacks has been decreasing fairly stably over the past 6 years. The rate of police killings against *unarmed* blacks has been dropping especially rapidly. In 2015, there were 78 police killings against unarmed black people. In 2018 and 2019, that number dropped to *28* per year. Of course, this is not to say that each police killing isn't a tragedy or that we should be satisfied with this number. This point is merely provide to some relevant context that most people are not aware of.

## Disproportionate police killings against blacks is caused by black criminality

In this section I will argue that disproportionate killings can be adequately explained by disproportionate black criminality with no reason to appeal to an anti-black bias with the CJS. The argument will proceed in the following steps. First I argue that, given the disproportionate level of black criminality, blacks are actually *under-represented* in police killings. Then I cite studies that attempt to find anti-black bias in policing which fail to find any such bias.

### Black criminality

As most people know (hopefully), blacks are exremely disproportionately likely to engage in criminal activity. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has recently published a report ["Prisoners in 2018"](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603213541/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf)] which shows that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned:

* Despite being only 13% of the general population, blacks comprise 32% of the prison population (410k out of 1.3M, see Table 14). 
* The imprisonment rate for black adults is over 5 times the rate for white adults (see Table 6). 
* The imprisonment rate for black 20-24 year-olds is *8* times the rate for their white counterparts (Figure 2). 
* The imprisonment rate for black 18-19 year-olds is over *12* times the rate for their white counterparts (Figure 2).

Someone might object by saying that this data merely reports black *imprisonment* rather than black *crime*. This objection can be dismissed by using [crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200604013633/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)] published by the FBI. The data shows that black people commit a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States:

* Blacks commit 36% of violent crime (despite being 13% of the general population).
* Blacks commit 51% of murders and 53% of robberies.
* Among criminals under the age of 18, blacks commit over 60% of murders and 68% of robberies.
* Among criminals under the age of 18, blacks commit over 50% of violent crime.

So racial disparities in imprisonment rates actually reflect racial disparities in criminality.

Someone might object by saying that the FBI data merely reports black *arrests* rather than black *crime*. These people argue that police are more likely to *arrest* black people, but it doesn't show that black people are more likely to *commit* crimes. This objection can be dismissed because we have other indicators for crime. [The CDC (2015)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)] reports the leading cause of death for people broken out by race and age. The results show a homicide epidemic within the black community:

* Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15-19, aged 20-24, and aged 25-35 (see page 34).
* Homicide is the cause of *most* deaths (50.8%) of black males aged 15-19 and nearly *half* (49.6%) of deaths of black males aged 20-24 (see page 34). For comparison, homicide was the cause of only 3-5% of the deaths of white males of this age (see page 27).
* The homicide death rate for blacks aged 20-24 (110.8 deaths per 100,000 population; page 34) is over _20 times_ the rate for similarly aged whites (5.4 deaths per 100,000 population; page 27). If anything, this suggests that the FBI arrest data may *under-estimate* the black homicide rate.

Someone might object by saying that the CDC data merely reports black *deaths* rates rather than black *murder* rates. This objection can be dismissed because, using [data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200530095126/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls)] from the FBI, we know that vast majority (88%) of homicides *against* black victims are committed *by* black offenders. So racial disparities in death rates reflect racial disparities in homicide rates. And the racial disparities in rates of homicide (and other crimes) explain the racial disparities in arrests and imprisonment.

The disproportionate rate of black criminality is not isolated to particular cities or regions of the country. Rampant black criminality is found in every area of the country. A [2019 study](https://vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide19.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200116091603/http://vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide19.pdf)] by the Violence Policy Center analyzed homicides during 2016 and reported that the black homicide rate was extremely high in *every* state in the country. The study reports that the black homicide rate was 20.44 per 100,000, whereas the national homicide rate was 5.10 per 100,000 and the white homicide rate was 2.96 per 100,000. The black homicide rate in *every* state with more than 10 black homicide victims was over 3 times the *average* white homicide rate (see Appendix two: Connecticut had a homicide rate of 9.27 per 100,000, which was the lowest black homicide rate of all states with more than 10 black homicide victims). 

Statistics from the FBI also indicate that blacks are far more likely than whites to kill a police officer:

* During [the period of 2009-2018](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2018/tables/table-42.xls) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200405015441/https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2018/tables/table-42.xls)], 38% of police killings (201 out of 532) were committed by black people. In 2018 (the latest year available), blacks committed 42% of police killings.
* During [the period of 2004-2013](https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2013/tables/table_44_leos_fk_race_and_sex_of_known_offender_2004-2013.xls) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200406165114/https://ucr.fbi.gov/leoka/2013/tables/table_44_leos_fk_race_and_sex_of_known_offender_2004-2013.xls)], 43% of police killings (243 out of 565) were committed by black people. In fact, there were some years where *most* police killings were committed by black people (keep in mind that black people are only 13% of the population).

If anything, the data suggests a possible *pro*-black bias by law enforcement regarding police killings. Despite the fact that black people commit ~50% of murders and ~40% of police killings, they only constitute ~25% of annual police killing victims. 

So we have a very plausible explanation for why black people are disproportionately killed by the police: they are disproportionately engaged in violent criminal activity, especially violent crimes which cause and warrant police killings. The disparity in criminality can explain the disparity in police killings with no need to appeal to an anti-black bias.

Of course, this does not *prove* that there is no anti-black bias. It is *possible* for the disproportionate police killings to be the result of an anti-black bias despite the high rates of black criminality. So, to make any conclusions, we need to review studies on police killings that attempt to measure anti-black bias.

### Studies on police killings

A [2015 review](https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/documents/our-work/2015-02%20-%20Correlates%20with%20Use%20of%20Force%20by%20Police%20Officers.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200419003513/https://www.rit.edu/liberalarts/sites/rit.edu.liberalarts/files/documents/our-work/2015-02%20-%20Correlates%20with%20Use%20of%20Force%20by%20Police%20Officers.pdf)] of literature on use of force by police officers finds several studies showing strong associations between the number of police kililngs and the level of crime in the area. Some of the studies include:

* "Smith (2004) examined the relationship between police force and inequality and race. Four variables were tested: threat, community violence, police professionalism, and police bureaucratic control." The study found that "violent crime rates and police killings of felons were positively related; cities that had more police killings of felons also had higher violent crime rates." (page 2)
* Another study "found that if the number of homicides was higher in a city, so is the number of police killings. The correlation with the number of police officer killings was strongest with justifiable citizen homicides and robbery-related homicides." (page 5)
* "Terrill and Reisig (2003) examined police use of force and its relationships with neighborhood variables and encounter-level variables (whether suspect was male or a minority, his or her age, and wealth) (Terrill & Reisig, 2003). Higher levels of force were found to occur significantly more in high-crime neighborhoods. Those who are suspected of a crime and live in disadvantaged neighborhoods were more likely to have a higher level of force used on them." (page 5)

Of course, these studies only show a relationship between an area's level of violent crime and the number of police killings. This does not *prove* that disproportionate police killings of black people is the result of a disparities in criminality. However, we do have other studies that attempt to test for anti-black bias in police killings at the national level. These studies fail to find evidence of any anti-black bias:

* In a [2010 content analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256255286_Understanding_police_use_of_force_A_review_of_the_evidence) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200607074848/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256255286_Understanding_police_use_of_force_A_review_of_the_evidence)] of use of force studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 1995 and 2008, the vast majority of studies demonstrated that the race of the suspect/officer had no strong relationship on the use of force by officer. Specifically, of the 17 studies that investigated the relationship between a *suspect's* race and use of force by the officer, only *2* studies found a positve relationship whereas 8 studies found no relationship and 7 studies had mixed findings (Table 1). Also, of the 11 studies that investigated the relationship between an *officer's* race and use of force by the officer, 9 studies found no relationship and 2 studies had mixed findings (Table 1).
* In a [2016 review](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200309095419/https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27)] of injuries resulting from law enforcement during arrests or police stops, researchers found that "when blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely than whites to be injured or die during that incident." This result would be very surprising if there was an anti-black bias in the policing. One would expect that a police officer who is biased against blacks would be more likely to injure or kill a black person during a stop or arrest.  
* A [2018 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200221142337/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108)] published in *Social Psychological and Personality Science* found that "When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. Multiverse analyses showed only _one_ significant anti-black disparity of 144 possible tests. Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings."
* A [2019 study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605062150/https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877)] on officer characteristics and racial disparities in fatal officer-involved shootings found "no evidence of anti-black or anti-Hispanic disparities across shootings, and white officers are not more likely to shoot minority civilians than non-white officers."

It seems to me that we have very solid evidence that the disproportionate killings of black people is caused by disproportionate black criminality. First, we know that black people are extremely disproportionately likely to engage in criminality activity, to a degree that is even more disproportionate than their rate of deaths by police. Second, we have ample studies that suggest that the number of police killings in an area is influenced by the crime rate of the area. Finally, studies that attempt to measure anti-black bias in police killings on a national level fail to find evidence of any such bias. The best explanation of disproportionate police killings of blacks is not an anti-black bias in the CJS; rather, it's disproportionate black criminality.

## Black criminality is not caused by anti-black bias in the CJS

In the remainder of this post, I will argue that disproportionate black criminality is not caused by an anti-black bias within the CJS. The argument will proceed in the following steps. First, I debunk a few of the most common alleged sources of anti-black bias within the CJ. Second, I cite instances of similar levels of misconduct among blacks who have not engaged with the CJS. This includes misconduct among black children that is found as early as preschool, and similar relative levels of criminality among blacks in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. This demonstrates that there are factors independent of the U.S. CJS that may cause the relative levels of black criminality in the United States. 

### The evidence for anti-black bias in the CJS is weak

Here I would like to what I take to be the two most commonly alleged sources of anti-black bias with in the CJS. The first alleged source of anti-black CJS bias is the fact that black suspects have higher arrest, conviction and incarceration rates and longer sentences than whites suspects of similar backgrounds. The second alleged source is the fact that blacks are incarcerated for drug related crimes more often than whites despite the fact that the two groups self-report that they use and sell drugs at comparable rates.

First, I would like to address the claim that black suspects, compared to white suspects suspected of the same crime, are arrested, convicted, incarcerated at higher rates, and are given longer sentences. These disparities do exist. However, an anti-black bias need not be best explanation for the disparities. For example, a [2013 study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913000470) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200411001915/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886913000470)] published in *Personality and Individual Differences* found that these disparities were "completely accounted for after including covariates for self-reported lifetime violence and IQ" (the abstract does not mention disparity in sentencing, but the full study notes that "race was not significantly associated with sentence length in the baseline model. After controlling for the effects of self-reported lifetime violence and verbal IQ, the effect of race on sentence length remained non-significant"). Again, we cannot infer anti-black bias in the system from the existence of racial disparities in outcomes.

Now, I would like to address the claim that blacks are disproportionately arrested for drug-related crimes despite using and selling drugs at comparable rates. Before explaining the problem with this claim, I would first like to note that the vast majority of blacks are not imprisoned for drug-related offenses. The ["Prisoners in 2018"](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf)] report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the following:

* The vast majority of black *state* prisoners are not imprisoned for drug related crimes. The majority (61%) are imprisoned for violent crimes. Only 13% of black prisoners are imprisoned for drug-related offenses (including e.g. trafficking), and only 3.2% are imprisoned for drug possession. For comparison, 4.5% of white prisoners are imprisoned for drug possession (Table 13). Note that state prisons contain the vast majority (88%) of all prisoners (page 3).
* About half (45%) of black *federal* prisoners are imprisoned for drug related crimes (Table 15) (federal prisoners constitute only 12% of all prisoners). But almost none of them were imprisoned for drug possession; 99% of federal drug ofenders were sentenced for trafficking (see note g of Table 15).

Now, back to the claim that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned for drug-related offenses given their self-reported rates of drug usage and drug sales. There are explanations for this disparity that do not involve appealing to an anti-black bias. For example, blacks are more likely to sell and do drugs in manners that increase the probability of an arrest:

* A [1995 report](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rdusda.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200602085024/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rdusda.pdf)] by the Bureau of Justice Statistics showed that some of the disparity between the black self-reported drug usage and the black drug arrest rate can be attributed to race-neutral factors. The reports says "Although blacks are 13% of drug users, they should comprise over 13% of drug possession arrests since the types of drugs they use, the frequency with which they use them, and the places where they use them, put blacks at greater risk of arrest." 
* A [2006 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7178364_Racial_differences_in_marijuana-users'_risk_of_arrest_in_the_United_States) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7178364_Racial_differences_in_marijuana-users'_risk_of_arrest_in_the_United_States)] on the purchase patterns of marijuana users showed that black people are more likely to engage in risky purchasing behaviors that increase their likelihood of arrest. The study revealed that "African Americans are nearly twice as likely to buy outdoors (0.31 versus 0.14), three times more likely to buy from a stranger (0.30 versus 0.09), and signiﬁcantly more likely to buy away from their homes (0.61 versus 0.48). These results provide an additional explanation for the differential in arrest rates between African Americans and whites."

Also, several studies have shown that blacks tend to under-report their rates of drug usage and other misconduct relative to whites:

* An [1982 article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274504185_On_the_Use_of_Self-Report_Data_to_Determine_the_Class_Distribution_of_Criminal_and_Delinquent_Behavior) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608014631/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274504185_On_the_Use_of_Self-Report_Data_to_Determine_the_Class_Distribution_of_Criminal_and_Delinquent_Behavior)] in the _American Sociological Review_ cited a study that found that "Correlations of black juvenile's SR delinquency scores with other external measures of delinquency were consistently smaller than was the case for white juveniles, suggesting less honest self-reports of black juveniles. The external measures included not only police records and juvenile court records, but also a measure of school misconduct and teacher ratings of hte boys as discipline problems and of the likelihood they would get in trouble in the future." (page 430).
* A [2005 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455900/pdf/11524_2006_Article_433.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170110065002/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455900/pdf/11524_2006_Article_433.pdf)] in the _Journal of Urban Health_ notes: "This study provides evidence that compared with other groups, African Americans may provide less valid information on drug-use surveys. The findings suggest that African American respondents had significantly lower concordance rates...the results replicate and extend a growing body of research suggesting that African Americans underreport substance use on surveys" (page ii77).
* Another [article (2006)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298539130_Examining_the_divergence_across_self-report_and_official_data_sources_on_inferences_about_the_adolescent_life-course_of_crime) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608014754/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298539130_Examining_the_divergence_across_self-report_and_official_data_sources_on_inferences_about_the_adolescent_life-course_of_crime)] published by the _Journal of Quantitative Criminology_ also cited a study which found that blacks were more likely than whites to fail to report being arrested: "Hindelang and colleagues (1981, p. 172) similarly find that a large number respondents in their sample failed to report being picked up by the police, and also that the failure to report varies by race and gender. white males failed to report 24% of the occasions when they were picked up by police; the figure for black males is 50%; for white females, 48%; and for black females, 70%." (page 6)
* Finally, a [2008 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495080/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170308104251/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495080/)] found that race was the best predictor for whether a person would underreport their drug usage: "The present study also identified predictors of discrepancies between self-report and hair testing. Race was the most salient predictor of cocaine disagreement. Even when other factors were controlled for, the self-report and hair test results for African Americans were more discrepant than for non-African Americans, a finding consistent with past studies (Fendrich, et al., 1999; Feucht, Stephens, & Walker, 1994). In a large study of youth (9−20), underreporting of cocaine was documented with urine testing validation as well (Fendrich & Yanchun, 1994) where African Americans in comparison to Caucasians who were urine positive were about 6 times less likely to report cocaine use when other factors are controlled for." (see section 4.2).

This only covers two of the alleged sources of anti-black bias within the U.S. criminal justice system. However, for the sake of brevity, I will not consider all of the possible alleged instances of anti-black bias. The data that I presented above should be sufficient to motivate a healthy level of skepticism when presented with any new allegations of anti-black bias.

### Early black misconduct

Now, consider the fact that misconduct appears in black children far before they interact with the criminal justice system:

* A [2010 report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)] on urban middle schoolers by the Southern Poverty Law Center showed that black males are nearly 3 times as likely as white males to be suspended (28.3% vs 10%) [Figure 2]. Black females are over 4 times as likely as white females to be suspended (18% vs 4%) [Figure 2].
* A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] on discipline disparities shows that the racial disparity in suspension rate is not accounted for by controlling for level of school poverty. At level of school poverty, black students are significantly more likely to be suspended than any other race of students. In fact, the out-of-school suspension rate for black students attending schools with the lowest level of poverty (7.5%) is *higher* than the rate for white students attending schools with the highest level of poverty (7.3%) [Table 14]. 

This misconduct appears even at *preschool*:

* A [2014 report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)] by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights shows that black children represent 18% of preschool enrollment, but 48% of preschool children suspended more than once. 
* An [2016 article](https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html)] by the LA Times reported "Although black girls represent 20% of preschool enrollment, but 54% of preschool girls suspended once or more were black."
* A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] on discipline disparities shows black preschoolers are over 3 times as likely as white preschoolers to be suspended (1.1% vs 0.3%) [Table 17]. 

Now, some people might accept these facts but deny that it demonstrates early misconduct by black children. One might argue that this demonstrates only that black children are disproportionately *punished* for *alleged* misconduct, but it doesn't show that they disprorportionately *engage* in misconduct. Such a person might argue that teachers and principals around the country have an anti-black bias when deciding who to punish. To this argument, I have a few responses: 

* While black teachers suspend black children at lower rates than white teachers do, they still suspend black children at a rate several times that of white children. For example, white male teachers suspend black male students at 3 times the rate of white male students (15.4% vs 5.2%), and black male teachers suspend black male students at 2.4 times the rate of white male students (12.7% vs 5.3%) [source: see [Figure 2](https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)] [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)]. So if racial differences in suspension rates are due to an anti-black bias, it looks like the same bias is found among black teachers. While this is certainly possible, it is of course less plausible.
* A [2014 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)] published in the _Journal of Criminal Justice_ found that prior problem behavior accounts for the racial disparity in school suspensions: "Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature." The study concludes, "these findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued." This finding is completely unexpected if we assume teachers had a strong anti-black bias. After all, if a teacher had an anti-black bias, why would she treat black and white students identically if they had comparable histories? Does her anti-black bias magically disappear when she's considering blacks and whites with the same history? No, the best explanation is that black students are suspended more because they are more likely to engage in misconduct.

### Black criminality around the world 

Now, consider the fact that we find similar relative levels of black criminality in other countries.

**United Kingdom**

According to [data from the UK Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)], black people are disproportionately imprisoned and arrested in England and Wales:

* The rate of first time entrants to the criminal justice system for blacks is twice the rate for whites (8.2 vs 3.6 per 1,000 population) [Table 4.15].
* Black people are arrested at 3 times the rate for white people (66.9 vs 22.8 per 1,000 population) [Table 3.12].
* Black people represented 13.1% of the prison population [Table 5.03] despite representing 3.1% of the general population [Table A].

The disproportionate black imprisonment and arrests is the result of disproportionate black criminality. For example, black criminality is particularly striking when we focus on homicides and knife crimes:

* A [2018 article](https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656)] by _News Sky_ revealed that despite being just 13% of London's population, blacks make up 48% of London murder suspects. These numbers are *strikingly* similar to the corresponding numbers in the United States population where, despite being only 13% of the general population, blacks make up 51% of those arrested for murder.
* A [2010 article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html)] by the _Sunday Telegraph_ released similar findings regarding violent crime in London. It reports that "the majority of men held responsible by police for gun crimes, robberies and street crimes are black." Specifically, the findings were that "among those proceeded against for street crimes, 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent."
* [Data](https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023234/https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018)] from the Metropolitan Police Service shows that blacks (or "Afro-Caribbeans") committed 48% of knife crimes in the UK during the years 2008-2018 (14,527 out of 30,486). Keep in mind that [blacks are only 3-4% of the UK population](http://www.irr.org.uk/research/statistics/ethnicity-and-religion/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/http://www.irr.org.uk/research/statistics/ethnicity-and-religion/)].
* The Metropolitan Police Service serves a [homicide dashboard](https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/homicide-dashboard/) that contains information on homicide victims and homicide offenders since 2003. Since 2003, black people have committed 1,489 homicides out of a total of 3,635, which means black people are responsible for 41% of homicides in the UK (combine the figures for "black - Caribbean", "black - African", and "black - Any other black background"). In 2019, blacks committed 93 out of 212 (44%) of all homicides. Note that this is nearly *double* the number of homicides committed by whites in the same year (52 homicides were committed by "white - British" and "white - Any other white background"). This is despite the fact that 87% of UK citizens are white and only 3% are black. 

**Canada**

Even in Canada, blacks are incarcerated at far higher rates than non-blacks:

* A [fact sheet](https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023409/https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf)] by the [Colour of Poverty](https://colourofpoverty.ca/fact-sheets/) reported "In 2016, black people comprise 3.5% of the general Canadian population, but made up 10% of the federally incarcerated population."
* The same fact sheet reported that "In 2016, 40% of inmates in segregation at the Toronto South Detention Centre were black, while being 7.5% of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area"
* A [2014 analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada)] published in the _Oxford Handbook of Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration_ reported that "Even though blacks represented only 2.5 percent of the Canadian population at the time of this study, they represented 8.4% all federally supervised offenders" [Table 1].
* The same analysis reported that the rate of correctional supervision for black people is 4 times higher than the white rate (page 6/27).
* A [1997 study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147637) published in *Crime and Justice* shows that the racial disparities in imprisonment are even more stark when we look at the imprisonment rate of males in Ontario. The study reveals that, among males, the prison admission rate for blacks was "6,796 per 100,000, compared to 1,326 for whites and 3,600 for Aboriginals. These incarcerations statistics show the same pattern as the data from the United States" (page 481).

As in the United States and in the UK, the disproportionate black  imprisonment in Canada is the result of disproportionate black *criminality* in Canada:

* In a [2007 case study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228395730_Effective_Crime_Prevention_in_Toronto_Canada) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228395730_Effective_Crime_Prevention_in_Toronto_Canada)] prepared for *Enhancing Urban Safety and Security*, researchers report that during the years 1992 through 2001, "the average annual homicide rate per 100,000 blacks in Toronto was almost five times higher than the overall homicide rate (10.1 compared with 2.4 per 100,000 population." They note that "this pattern parallels that in the U.S." (page 6)
* A [2013 commentary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974223/pdf/41997_2013_Article_BF03405647.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024744/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974223/pdf/41997_2013_Article_BF03405647.pdf)] published in the *Canadian Journal of Public Health* revealed that between 1992 and 2003, young blacks accounted for 30% of murder victims and 36% of offenders in Toronto area homicides, even though they only represented about 10% of Toronto's population. The commentary also notes that the murder rate of black Toronto residents has risen from 2.4 per 100,000 in the 1990s to 10.1 per 100,000 in 2004, despite an overall decline in violent crime during this period (page 12).
* In a [2014 commentary](https://health.gradstudies.yorku.ca/files/2016/09/The-Canadian-war-on-drugs-Structural-violence-and-unequal-treatment-of-blacks.pdf?x35134) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024845/https://health.gradstudies.yorku.ca/files/2016/09/The-Canadian-war-on-drugs-Structural-violence-and-unequal-treatment-of-blacks.pdf?x35134)] published in the *International Journal of Drug Policy* on the impact of Canadian drug law policies on black communities, it was revealed that "homicide rates among blacks in Montreal were estimated to be as high as 24 per 100,000, strikingly higher than their white counterparts at 3 per 100,000" (page 193).
* The previously linked study shows that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned in every province. It shows that "sizeable black populations in Ontario and Nova Scotia represented 3.8% and 2.1% of provincial populations from 2010 to 2011, respectively, but accounted for 18% and 14% of admissions to Ontario and Nova Scotian jails (Owusu-Bempah & Wortley, 2014). This trend also holds true in provinces with less significant proportions of blacks. In New Brunswick, blacks only account for 0.6% of the population; nevertheless they represent 2.4% of the province’s inmates. Similarly, in Alberta, blacks represent 1.4% of the province’s residents but 5% of its prison population"

As with the United States, misconduct appears among black children in Toronto far before they have had any interaction with the criminal justice system. A [fact sheet](https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-3-racialized-poverty-in-education-learning-3.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024914/https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-3-racialized-poverty-in-education-learning-3.pdf)] by the [Colour of Poverty](https://colourofpoverty.ca/fact-sheets/) reported the following:

* "In 2015, there was a 69% high school graduation rate for black students and 50% for Indigenous students, versus 84% for white students".
* "black students were 12% of the Toronto District School Board student population but represented 48% of all expulsions; Indigenous students were 0.3% of the student population and 1% of all expulsions; Eastern, Mediterranean and Southwest Asian students were 4% of the population but 8% of all expulsions"

**Other countries**

* **Switzerland**: a [2010 article](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/neue-statistik-tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-exjugoslawen/story/27784193) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/neue-statistik-tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-exjugoslawen/story/27784193)] published in a Swiss newspaper reported that "Men from Angola, Nigeria and Algeria receive six times more criminal complaints in Switzerland than Swiss men. In return, the Swiss are almost twice as criminal as immigrated Germans." (translate page to English)
* **Germany**: in a [2016 article](https://www.unz.com/akarlin/immigrant-crime-in-germany/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.unz.com/akarlin/immigrant-crime-in-germany/)] published to the *Unz Review*, immigrants from African and Middle Eastern countries have considerably higher rates of murder and sexual assault than European and East Asian immigrants.

A [2013 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178913000566) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178913000566)] published in _Aggression and Violent Behavior_ grouped the homicide rates by race and found that the homicide rates for blacks (34.6 per 100,000) was over 2 times the rate for whites (16.3), and over 5 times the rate for Asians (6.8) (see section 4.1). Trends in homicide rates can be found [here](https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608025123/https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract)].
* **South Africa**: a [2008 article](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/prisons-race-shock-426802) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/prisons-race-shock-426802)] published in a South African newspaper reported that the incarceration rate for the "Coloured" (651 per 100,000) and African population (342 per 100,000) was over five times the rate for the white and Indian population (60 per 100,000). A [2004 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242681486_Every_six_hours_a_woman_is_killed_by_her_intimate_partner_A_National_Study_of_Female_Homicide_in_South_Africa) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608025121/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242681486_Every_six_hours_a_woman_is_killed_by_her_intimate_partner_A_National_Study_of_Female_Homicide_in_South_Africa)] on female homicides in South Africa found that the rate of intimate femicide for "Coloureds" (18.3 per 100,000) was 6 times the rate for whites (2.8 per 100,000), and the rate for Africans (8.9 per 100,000) was over 3 times the rate for whites.

**Around the world**:

* When we look at [the national homicide rates of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), we find that countries with predominantly black populations (e.g. nations in the Caribbean and Subsaharan Africa) tend to have far higher homicide rates than European and Asian countries.
* Finally, consider [*The Handbook of Crime Correlates*](https://archive.org/details/LeeEllisKevinM.BeaverJohnWrightHandbookOfCrimeCorrelates/page/n7/mode/2up), a huge book published in 2009 that collects the summary analysis of crime research around the world. *Every* study that compared the rates of violent crime by blacks  and whites found that being black was significantly associated with criminality (Table 2.3.2a). Also, *every* study that compared the rates of criminal and delinquent behavior (excluding violent crimes) by blacks and whites found that being black was significantly associated with property offenses, drug offenses, and delinquency.

It seems to me that we have very solid evidence that U.S. black criminality is not caused by anti-black bias in the CJS . First, two of the most common alleged sources of anti-black bias can be debunked by reviewing other studies. Second, we find comparable levels of relative criminality among blacks who have never engaged with the U.S. CJS. This includes black children who display behavioral problems as early as preschool age, and it includes black criminality in other countries around the world. The best explanation of this widespread misconduct and criminality does not involve any appeal to an anti-black bias in the CJS.

My post here is agnostic with respect to the cause of the widespread black criminality. However, I feel it is worth quickly responding to a common assumption, which is that socioeconomic factors such as poverty, income, inequality, etc. are the primary causes of disproportionate black criminality. It seems to me that there is little evidence that controlling for these socioeconomic factors reduces the majority of the racial gap in criminality. For example, [data](https://eji.org/news/study-rich-black-kids-more-likely-incarcerated-than-poor-white-kids/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20170610114455/http://eji.org/news/study-rich-black-kids-more-likely-incarcerated-than-poor-white-kids)] shows that poor white kids are less likely to be imprisoned than rich black kids. Also, some studies - e.g. [Land et al (1990)](http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/phd/courses/2007/01_winter/csss589/land.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200321195430/http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/phd/courses/2007/01_winter/csss589/land.pdf)] - have found that homicide rates in U.S. cities is associated with percent black to a stronger degree than with some socioeconomic variables such as median income or percentage of families below poverty level. Finally, differences in socioeconomic status don't seem to explain differences in criminality between other racial groups. For example, Asian Americans have far lower [crime rates](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200604013633/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)] than whites despite having comparable [poverty rates](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605200257/https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2013/acs/acsbr11-17.pdf)], and Native Americans have far lower crime rates than blacks despite having comparable poverty rates. I have [noted elsewhere](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/) that racial disparities in criminality may be explained to a large degree by racial disparities in IQ. An honest assessment of the cause of black criminality probably warrants a separate post. Regardless, it should be clear that black criminality in the U.S. is not the result of anti-black bias in the United States criminal justice system.

## Conclusion

My goal here was to provide reason to refute the seemingly mainstream assumption that disproportionate police killings against black people is evidence of anti-black bias in the U.S. CJS. I argued that this assumption is mistaken because the best explanation of disproportionate police killings against black people consists in the fact that black people disproportionately engage in criminal activity and the fact that the police disproportionately kill criminals. Further, I argued that disproportionate black criminality is not the result of an anti-black bias in the U.S. CJS, since we find similar relative levels of misconduct and criminality among blacks who have not interacted with the United States criminal justice system. I make no specific normative prescriptions with this post. My only hope is that conversations involving black criminality and the criminal justice system can be more fruitful when all parties are aware of the relevant facts and we aren't making faulty assumptions on key issues.
