Frege:
	- proper names must have senses. 
	- This is the only way for a = b to be informative
	- Because even though a and b refer to the same thing
	- It is not analytically true
	- Thus, they are informative.

Searle:
	- This makes sense only if a or b is a definite desciption.
	- If they are both proper names, then a=b is analytically true

Sense:
	- It doesn't seem that proper names have senses in the way that predicates because we do not e.g. give definitions of proper names.
	- So how can a=b have information not conveyed by a=a?

Analyticity	
	- a statement is analytic if and only if it is true in virtue of linguistic rules alone, without recoruse to empirical investigation
		- What about synthetic a priori?
	- The linguistic rules for using "Cicero" and "Tully" are such that they are both refer to the same identical object.So they are analytic.
	- But "Tully"="Cicero" is analytic because it illustrates certain contingent facts about words (without describing these facts)
	- Some claim "Tully"="Tully" is different from "Tully"="Cicero" because the former is true of any arbitrary substitution of symbols replacing "Tully"
		- This is not true. It is only true given our contingent usage of words, where words used in different orders are understood to refer to different things.
	- This means both are informative without either being propositions about words, and without saying they have the same reference but different senses.

How are we able to refer to an object by using its name?
	- We use certain characteristics of an object and teach others that it has a certain proper name.
	- This means that the rules for a proper name are logically tied to particular characteristics of an object.
	- This means that names have senses necessarily, but references only contingently.
	- One objection might be: 
		- explaining the use of a name by citing the characteristics of the object is not giving the rules for the name, because the rules contain no descriptive content. 
		- The rules is simply to correlate the name to the object independently of any descriptions.
		- But this seems wrong. If all of are characteristics proved false, then we would say that Aristotle did not exist and that the name didn't refer to anyone, not just that Aristotle denoted no objects.
	- Proper names necessarily have a shorthand and vague description.

Two theories:
	- Proper names essentially have a reference, but have no sense (Mill).
		- IMplied by the subject-predicate structure of the language
	- Proper names essentially have a sense, and contingenty a reference (Frege)
		- Implied by the way we use and teach the use of proper names.

What is a proper name's sense?
	- A complete description of the object referred to by the name?
		- Then all true statements of the object would be analytic. All false statements self-contradictory
	- Necessary and sufficient conditions for applying a particular name to a particular object?
		- Possibly, let us see...

What is the difference between proper names and definite descriptions
	- What is the function of proper names in our language?
	- Both proper names and definition descriptions presuppose the existence of one and only one object referred to.
	- But proper names do not in general specify any characertistics of the object.
	- So how do proper names refer?
	- Answer: though proper names do not specify or assert any characteristics, they presuppose that the object that they refer to has certain characteristics.
	- Proper names presuppose the truth of certain uniquely referring descriptive statements without asserting them.
	- A statement "Aristotle never existed" says more than "Aristotle" never referred to anything because the former asserts that a sufficient - but unspecified - number of conventional presuppositions about "Aristotle" are false.

Imprecision:
	- What constitutes the criteria for a proper name is left open.
	- This problem seldom arises. When it does arise, we arbitrarily decide what the criteria shall be.
	- E.g. if it turned out that half of the descriptions for Aristotle were true for one man, and hlf for another man, who would be Aristotle?
	- The looseness of the criteria for proper names is a necessary condition for isolating the referring function from the describing function of language.
	- We want to be able to refer to an object without raising questions about any descriptions about it.
	- Thus, the imprecision is an aspect of the function that proper names play, not an accidental fact about our language.
	- If we abandoned "Aristotle" and said "the teacher of Alexander", then it is a necessary truth that the man referred to is Alexander's teacher.
		- Why can't it be an analytic contingent statement?
