## I. THE CASE FOR THE RIGHT TO CLOSED BORDERS

1. Freedom of association is widely thought to be important.
	- Today, virtually everyone agrees that we are entitled to marital and religious freedom of association; we take it for granted that each individual has a right to choose his or her marital partner and the associates with whom he or she practices his or her religion
2. It includes the right not to associate and even, in many cases, the right to disassociate.
	- In the case of matrimony, for instance, this freedom involves more than merely having the right to get married. One fully enjoys freedom of association only if one may choose whether or not to marry a second party who would have one as a partner.

Just as an individual has a right to determine whom (if anyone) he or she would like to marry, a group of fellow-citizens has a right to determine whom (if anyone) it would like to invite into its political community. And just as an individual’s freedom of association entitles one to remain single, a state’s freedom of association entitles it to exclude all foreigners from its political community.

### Objection 1

Objection: There are morally relevant differences between individuals and groups, and these differences might explain why only individuals can have a right to self-determination.

We regularly assign groups presumptive right to freedom of association
- Even those who insist that the Boy Scouts should be legally forced to include gays and atheists or that Augusta National cannot justify their continued exclusion of women typically concede that there are weighty reasons in favor of allowing these groups to determine their own membership.
- the activists claim only that the prima facie case in favor of group self-determination is liable to be outweighed in sufficiently compelling instances

We regularly assign countries presumptive right to freedom of association
- Think of Canada’s choice to join NAFTA, or Slovenia’s decision to enter the EU, for instance. No one believes that it would be permissible to force Canada into NAFTA or to coerce Slovenia to join the EU. (Of course, nor may Canada or Slovenia unilaterally insert themselves into these associations!).
- And the reason it is wrong to forcibly include these countries is because Canada’s and Slovenia’s rights to self-determination entitle them to associate (or not) with other countries as they see fit.
-  Without positing a right to freedom of association, we could not satisfactorily explain what is wrong with one country forcibly annexing another.
- Would it be permissible for the United States to forcibly annex Canada? No, even if the United States could execute this unilateral merger without disrupting the peace or violating the individual rights of any Canadians, this hostile takeover would be impermissible.

### Objection 2

Objection: even if it is possible for groups to have rights, presumably the interests a group of citizens might have in controlling immigration are nowhere near as important as an individual’s interest in having a decisive say regarding who he or she marries.
- in the vast majority of cases, fellow citizens will never even meet one another
- since there is no intimacy among compatriots, it is not at all clear why we need to respect freedom of association for groups of citizens.

My argument does not rely upon these two types of freedom of association being equally important. 
- Notice, for instance, that being able to choose the associates with whom one worships is also less important than having discretion over one’s marital partner, but no one concludes from this that we need not respect freedom of association in the religious realm.

In my view, autonomous individuals and legitimate states both have rights to autonomy
- Freedom of association is not something that requires an elaborate justification, then, since it is simply one component of the self-determination which is owed to all autonomous individuals and legitimate states
- One need not explain how playing golf is inextricably related to the development of one’s moral personality, say, in order to justify one’s right to play golf, neither must one show that one’s membership in a golf club is crucial to one’s basic interests to establish the club members’ right to freedom of association. And if no one doubts that golf clubs have a presumptive right to exclude others, then there seems no reason to suspect that a group of citizens cannot also have the right to freedom of association

For several reasons it seems clear that control over membership in one’s state is extremely important.

1. The country’s course will be charted by the members of this civic association. 
- People rightly care very deeply about their countries, and, as a consequence, they rightly care about those policies which will effect how these political communities evolve. And since a country’s immigration policy affects who will share in controlling the country’s future, it is a matter of considerable importance.
- Because the members of a group can change, an important part of group self-determination is having control over what the “self” is. 
- the very same reasoning which understandably leads people to jealously guard their state’s sovereignty also motivates them to keep an eye on who can gain membership in this sovereign state

2. A second, less obvious, reason to care about immigration policy has to do with one’s duties of distributive justice. As I will argue in the next
section, it seems reasonable to think that we have special distributive responsibilities to our fellow citizens. 

3. Rather than continue to list reasons why citizens ought to care about issues of political membership, let me merely point out that
citizens today obviously do care passionately about immigration.

### Constraints

I seek to defend a deontological conclusion about how legitimate states are entitled to act, not a consequential prescription for how to maximize happiness or a practical recipe for how states might best promote their own interests
- Just as one might defend the right to divorce without believing that many couples should in fact separate, I defend a legitimate state’s right to control its borders without suggesting that strict limits on immigration would necessarily maximize the interests of either the state’s constituents or humanity as a whole.
- While I conceive of freedom of association in deontological terms, I do not thereby suppose that it is necessarily absolute.

The second aspect of my account worth highlighting is that my defense of freedom of association makes no mention of a political community’s distinctive character or culture. 
- In contrast to authors like Walzer and Miller, my account emphasizes that anyone is entitled to freedom of association. 
- Thus, just as few would suggest that individuals have a right to marry only people of their own ethnicity, culture, nationality, or character, I do not believe that a group’s right to limit immigration depends upon its members sharing any distinctive ethnic/cultural/national characteristics.

## II. THE EGALITARIAN CASE FOR OPEN BORDERS

Given that one’s country of birth is a function of brute luck, it seems grossly unfair that one’s place of birth would so profoundly affect one’s life prospects. Some believe that the solution is clear: political borders must be opened, so that no one is denied access to the benefits of wealthy societies.

### Response 1

First, I suggest that the most compelling understanding of equality does not require us to guarantee that no one’s life prospects are affected by matters of luck; more minimally, equality demands that we address those inequalities that render people vulnerable to oppressive relationships. If this is correct, then the particular theory of equality required to motivate the egalitarian case for open borders is suspect and should be rejected in favor of a theory of relational equality. 

### Response 2

Second, even if luck egalitarianism is the best theory of equality, it would not generate a duty to leave borders open, because a wealthy state’s redistributive responsibilities can be discharged without including the recipients in the union.
- It is standard to keep separate our rights to freedom of association and our duties of distributive justice, so that wealthy people are able to marry whomever they choose and then are required to transfer a portion of their wealth to others no matter whom (or even whether) they marry.
- And just as our domestic redistribution of wealth among individuals has not led us to prohibit marriage, global redistribution does not require us to open all political borders. 
- why cannot wealthy countries fully discharge their global distributive duties without including the recipients in their political union, simply by transferring the required level of funds abroad?

Even if legitimate states have no duty to open their borders to the world’s poor, however, surely it would be unconscionable for a state to slam its doors on people desperately fleeing unjust regimes.
- I am not convinced that the only way to help victims of political injustice is by sheltering them in one’s political territory. 
- These people might also be helped in something like the fashion in which wealthy societies could choose to assist impoverished foreigners: by, as it were, exporting justice
- one can intervene, militarily if necessary, in an unjust political environment to ensure that those currently vulnerable to the state are made safe in their homelands.

## III. THE LIBERTARIAN CASE FOR OPEN BORDERS

As this example illustrates, libertarian arguments against restricting immigration can take either of two forms, depending upon whether they focus on property rights or rights to free movement.

### First Argument

The former emphasizes the rights of those within the state and contends that limiting immigration violates individual property owners’ rights to invite foreigners to visit their private property. 
- States may not limit immigration because doing so wrongly restricts their constituents’ rights to private property.

There is a conflict between a state’s sovereignty over its territory and an individual property owner’s dominion over her land
- but in this case I am inclined to favor the claims of a (duly limited) state
- one cannot consistently insist that property rights are totally unlimited without committing oneself to anarchism. T
- effective political society would not be possible unless some crucial decisions were made by the group as a whole, and all areas of group sovereignty imply a corresponding lack of individual dominion.

One might eschew anarchism and still suggest that individual property rights take precedence over a state’s right to control its borders
- There are several reasons to be skeptical of this approach.
- If each individual’s right to freedom of association must always take precedence over the group’s, on the other hand, then it follows that every single Canadian had the right to veto Canada’s involvement in NAFTA or a single Slovenian citizen would be entitled unilaterally to block Slovenia’s membership in the EU. 
- Consider an uncontested secession like Norway’s break from Sweden in 1905. In this case, more than 99 percent of the Norwegians voted in favor of political divorce and Sweden as a country did not resist the separation. If each individual’s right to freedom of association trumps the state’s right to self-determination in those cases in which the group as a whole seeks to disassociate from others, however, then Norway’s secession was unjustified; it was impermissible because every last Norwegian (if not also each Swede) had the right unilaterally to veto the political divorce

A second reason to doubt that an individual’s dominion over her private property takes precedence over the state’s control of its territorial borders stems from the twin facts that (1) an inability to invite foreigners onto one’s land is typically not an onerous imposition and (2) bringing outsiders into the political community has real consequences for one’s compatriots. 
- (2) all those who enter the territory for an indefinite period must be welcomed as equal members of the political community. If so, however, this explains why a person’s inviting foreigners onto her land has important moral implications for all of the state’s citizens.
- while I am skeptical that an individual has the right to invite foreigners to live on her land indefinitely, I do not see why property owners may not invite outsiders to visit for limited periods. In fact, one need not even object to a guest worker arrangement, as long as the worker does not stay too long.
- (1) And once we make room for this additional right for property owners, one gets a better sense of why the remaining restrictions upon their dominion over their property is rarely terribly onerous

### Second Argument

The latter stresses the rights of foreigners, claiming that closing territorial borders wrongly restricts an individual’s right to freedom of movement.

I do not think that the right to free movement is perfectly general and absolute.
- E.g. My right to freedom of movement does not entitle me to enter your house without your permission
- This does not deny the right to freedom of movement. E.g. No one says that I am denied my right to marriage merely because I cannot unilaterally choose to marry you against your will. 

There is no inconsistency in insisting upon freedom of emigration and internal migration, on the one hand, and allowing states to restrict immigration, on the other hand.
- Freedom of association includes the option not to associate; one may unilaterally emigrate because one is never forced to associate with others, but one may not unilaterally immigrate because neither are others required to associate with you.
- Immigration is importantly different because, unlike either emigration or internal migration, it can involve costs to those who must include you as an equal in their political community
- A state that denies emigration (or perhaps even one that denies internal migration, for that matter) treats its citizens as tantamount to political property insofar as it forces them to remain in the union, regardless of their preferences.

## IV. A QUESTION OF CRITERIA

Walzer: Australians would in fact be permitted to admit only whites, but only if they ceded a portion of their territory to those who needed it to survive.

Miller: a state may not exclude immigrants based upon a category like race because doing so wrongly insults applicants of the rejected race.

Wellman: we have a special duty to respect our fellow citizens as equal partners in the political cooperative. With this in mind, I suggest that a country may not institute an immigration policy which excludes entry to members of a given race because such a policy would wrongly disrespect those citizens in the dispreferred category.

Thus, unless Australia were already composed exclusively of white constituents (and no state is completely homogenous), it would be impermissible to institute immigration policies designed to approximate a “White Australia,” not because such policies might insult potential black immigrants (though no doubt it would) but because they would fail to treat nonwhite Australians as equals. And because no state is completely without minorities who would be disrespected by an immigration policy which invoked racial/ethnic/religious categories, no state may exclude potential immigrants on these types of criteria.
