# Humean Theory of Motivation

There are two forms of principles that characterize the Humean theory of motivation, a weaker and a stronger principle.

- Strong principle: R at t constitutes a motivating reason of agent A to X iff there is some G such that R at t consists of an appropriately related desire of A to G and a belief that were she to X she would G. In other words, a motivating reason to do X consists of a desire-belief pair such that the agent believes that doing X would satisfy the desire.
- Weak principle: Agent A at t has a motivating reason to X only if there is some G such that, at t, A desires to G and believes that were she to X she would G. In other words, a motivating reason to X exists only if there exists a desire-belief pair such that the agent believes that doing X would satisfy the desire.  

The weaker principle represents an *existence* criterion, whereas the stronger principle represents a *constitution* criterion. The weaker principle merely states that all motivating reasons *require* an appropriate desire-belief; the stronger principle states that all motivating reasons are *constituted* by an appropriate desire-belief pair. All anti-Humeans are united against the stronger principle.

The distinction between motivating reasons and normative reasons should be noted. The concept of a reason for action is loosely defined by two dimensions of explanation and justification. A motivating reason emphasizes the explanatory dimension, whereas a normative reason emphasizes the justificatory dimension. Both kinds of reasons are similar in that they render an agent's action intelligible. To say that someone has normative reason to do X is to utter a *truth* stating that her X-ing is justified from the perspective of the normative system (i.e. from rationality, prudence, morality, etc.) that generates the requirement. To say that someone has a motivating reason to X is to describe a *psychological state* which is explanatory of her X-ing, other things being equal.

One can have a normative reason to X without a motivating reason to X. Likewise, one can have a motivating reason to X without a normative reason to X. Both cases can be due to ignorance or irrationality.

## Desires as dispositions

*Phenomenlogical Conception*. According to Hume, desire are a certain kind of feeling, an emotion that we are directly aware of which is phenomenologically salient. This would be a strong phenomenlogical conception of desires, where desires are sensations with a certain phenomenological content. The problem with this conception is that it is incompatible with a plausible epistemology of desire. According to this conception, just as a subject is in pain if and only if he believes he is in pain, a subject desires to X if and only if he believes that he desires X. There are two problems with this conception:

1. People can be fallible about their desires. Firstly, an agent desires something without believing that they do, e.g. children who lash out or cry for seemingly no reason and then calm down when they recieve attention. Secondly, an agent can falsy believe that they desire something, e.g. someone who believes they fundamentally desire to have a certain brand of brand of clothing, when its actually a derivative desire that derives from a fundamental desire for social acceptance and an implicit association between the brand with social acceptance.
2. Desires have propositional content whereas sensations do not. Ascriptions of desires may be given in the form 'A desires p' where 'p' is a proposition. Ascriptions of sensations do not have this constraint.

*World-to-mind fit*. An superior alternative conception of desire can be given based on focusing on its direction of fit. There are two directions of fit of mental states with the world. Beliefs are a kind of mind-to-world fit state of mind; they aim at truth and their being true is their fitting with the world. Desires are a kind of world-to-mind fit state of mind. They aim at realization and their realization is the world fitting with them. Whereas a belief that p tends to vanish upon perceiving that not-p, a desire to p tends to persist upon perceiving that not-p.

*Dispositional Conception*. More precisely, desires are states with a functional, dispositional role. To desire to G is to be disposed to X in conditions where they believe they can G by X-ing.

## Desires as Motivating Reasons

The following argument can be given to show that motivating reasons are constituted by, among other things, desires.

1. Having a motivating reasons is having a goal.
2. Having a goal is a world-to-mind fit.
3. Having a world-to-mind fit is a desire.
4. Therefore, motivating reasons are constituted by desires.

(1) cannot be reasonably rejected because reasons as explanations are teological explanations. The *function* of a motivating reason is to motivate someone *towards* some state, which can be characterized as a goal. (2) cannot be rejected because a goal to p is not automatically dismissed upon perceiving that p is not true, so it cannot be a mind-to-world fit. (3) might be rejected for two different reasons.

1. The first objection states that desires are not the only world-to-fit state of mind. This objection can be dismissed by broadening the concept of desire to include all world-to-mind states of mind. This would not change the spirit of the Humean Theory of Motivation.
2. The second objection states that there can be a state with both directions of fit, e.g. a *besire*. But this doesn't work when considering what happens when one besires that p and perceives that not-p. If this tends to cause the besire to vanish, then the besire can't be a world-to-mind fit, but if this allows the besire to persist, then the besire can't be a mind-to-world fit. It might be objected that the attitude has two directions of fit but at different content. But this implies that there can be cases where someone has a besire and the desire and belief can never be pulled apart. This seems implausible, for it seems possible that one can have besire at one time and then have their motivation sapped later without losing their initial belief.
