# Constructing Protagorean Objectivity

Values have protagorean objectivity if the following conditions are met:

1. They are dependent on us by their very nature,
2. They are fully objective as values

Constructivists theories attempt to explain how these two conditions can be combined.
We can reject subjectivism, relativism, etc. which immunizes individuals or groups from error.
We can also reject Platonism, theological voluntarism or any other view that allows radically esoteric values.
Constructivism is thus an attractive middleground between standard "realist" and "anti-realist" views.

This work outlines a possible constructivist theory that can explain protagorean objectivity.
It does not aim to defend such a theory.

Such a theory may not be a proper "metaethical" proposal. 
It avoids some conventional metaethical questions in the "realist" versus "anti-realist" debate.
In fact, we should not take any questions for granted. 
Questions must be justified as not misguided.
The proper methodology is *default quietism*: any "meta-question" is presumed misguided, until shown to be well-motivated and admits of illuminating answers.

One important question is: what is the deep mistake in assuming that to conclude from the rejection of subjectivism, etc. that objective values must be located somewhere within the impersonal world.
Standard constructivists have not answered this question. 
The position outlined here will.

## Constructivism: Four Theses

1. Basic Thesis: necessarily, a normative proposition is true if and only if (and because) anyone capable of following the norms of practical reasoning would affirm it on the basis of valid, faultless reasoning, in conditions optimal for practical reflection.
2. Constitutional Conception of Validity: to reason validly is to manifest a full understanding of the activity of reasoning. 
3. Protagorean Constraint: validity in practical reasoning cannout oustrip the patterns of thought exhibited in the human practice of practical reasoning.
4. Rationalist Anti-Skepticism: (1) Good practical reasoning favors a range of particular ethical conclusions associated with commonsense ethics (e.g. "Slavery is bad", "Pain is bad", etc.), and (2) We cannot adequately understand ourselves except as creatures endowed with practical reason, understood to include reasoned practical judgment.

## Precluding brute error

Constructivism assumes the sub-claims (1) and (2) of the Rationalist Anti-Skepticism thesis can each be negatively justified.
Any theory that denies these can be denied on their own terms, without assumption of constructivism's other positive thesis.
E.g. Basic practical/moral claims - pain is bad - exploitation is unjust - are manifestly more plausible than a theory that rejected them.
E.g. Nietzsche, Hume, Darwin, etc. argue we cannot recognize ourselves without practical reasoning.

Minimal realism can account for this without any of the additional constructivist thesis.
I.e. it claims that particular ethical claims are true, objectively true, known, and stops there.
The question, then, is why is a further metaethical exlpanation (i.e. constructivism) even needed?
A further explanation (i.e. constructivism) is needed to explain how there can be objective ethical truth that depends on us.
The constructivism outlined here does this best by adderssing the possibility of brute error - error despite the best of human reasoning.
Constructivism is distinctive in htat it explicitly rules out the possibility of brute error.

The Basic Thesis proposes *explanation*.
The norms governing practical reasoning are valid independently of the truth of the judgments to which they lead.
"Optimal conditions" are elaborated in terms of such truth-independent norms, which are *imperatives* of thought and judgment.
Ethical propositions, which are truth-apt, are explained in terms of such *imperatives*.

Minimal realism does not provide an explicitly protagorean account of objective values.
Assume there is an ethical dispute between two parties advancing incompatible claims.
The question is: what explains how one of these claims could be the truth?
On minimal realism, there just is an objective truth and we are able to know it.
But this is not really an *explanation*. 

One might say "one party has better arguments".
This makes sense if one says "best arguments constructs ethical truth", but this is the constructivist position.
Otherwise, one must say that best agruments coincides with ethical truth.
Now, we need to explain this relation, the relation between independently fixed ethical truth and good reasoning/arguments.
The relation is either contingent or it is necessary.
If it is contingent, then we can be in brute error because we could reason perfectly and still be wrong.
It can be necessary only if "best reasoning" is *defined* as whatever is independently truth, which allows brute error about "best reasoning". 

The Basic Thesis precludes brute error at the level of basic ethical judgments.
The Constitutional Conception of Validity and the Protagorean Constraint precludes brute error at the level of reasoning.

We can reject conventionalism, relativism, subjectivism, etc. (based on actual attitudes) in the same general way.
We can regard ethical truths as "objective" in case their truth value is *invariant* with respect to possible differences in our attitudes.
It doesn't require an explanation for why the relations of attitude invariance hold.
We can thus show that the norms of practical reasoning allows us to criticize certain attitudes independent of an agent/group's attitudes.
For any subjective condition of an agent/group C, so long as we can criticize C's relevance, then ethical truth does not vary with C.
Thus, ethical truth would be objective with respect to that C.

## The autonomy of the ethical from the outside

We might still ask what does validity in practical reasoning consist in or what does "valid" mean.
Possible answers include expressivism, platonism, etc.
Constructivism adopts quietism with respect to those questions. 
Thus, constructivism is not in conflict with traditional theories that do answer those questions.
Constructivism trascends rather than enters these traditional metaethical debates.
Korsgaard claims norms of rationality only arise from the practical standpoint, ignoring much metaethical theoretical/explanatory aspirtations.

## An intellectualist approach

Kosgaard's appeal to constitution is a *voluntaristic* version of the Constitutional Conception of Validity. 
The activity of "practical reasoning" is understood as the activity of choice or "action".
This threatens the objectivity of values.
A better version is an "intellectualist" version of the Constitutional Conception.
"Practical reasoning" is not action per se, but a species of *judgment*, guided by imperatives of *thought*.
There is a strong constitutive relation between validity and the practice of *reasoned practical judgment.*

*Reasoned practical judgment* begins when one poses a question about what is to be done in a situation.
It ends when one reaches a judgment on the matter.
This process is psychologically guided by norms, understood as imperatives of thought.
E.g. "Consider this", "Ignore that", etc. tell us which facts are relevant features, how long to deliberate, what general principles to take as explaining relavent features, etc.
The same guiding norms provide a basis for evaluating a process of reflection as defective. E.g. a person may have:
underestimated the force of certain features, have been ill motivated, unimaginative, stubborn, mentally unsound, under duress, etc.

Thus, The activity of reasoned practical judgment is constitutively open to assessment as well or badly done.
Were one to "reason" at whim without accountability for some norms, one wouldn't be engaged in *reasoned* practical judgment.
They would be engaged in something else, perhaps deference to authority or make-believe.
Reasoned practical judgment is non-structured by its very nature.
This thus far does not say why *particular* norms count as valid or invalid in a process of thought.

To sufficiently grossly violate certain specific requirements of an activity is not to be engaged in the activity at all.
I.e. to sufficiently grossly violate the ground rules of chess is not to play chess.
To sufficiently similarly violate constraints of reasoning (i.e. "formal constraints" such as consistency) is not to be engaged in reasoning.
If one violates the reqiurements, but not sufficiently grossly, then one still engages in the activity, but badly.
All validity in reasoning is is fully understanding what is involved in making a reasoned practical judgment.

The Constitutional Conception is a thesis *external* to practical reasoning.
Because it is (1) about validity in general and (2) neutral with regard to what is valid (i.e. neutral regarding substantive content).
Question of validity are apt only as internal questions.
A judgment of validity is invariably first personal and not a purely "descriptive" affair.
Any classification of a requirement as necessary to understand an activity cannot but rely on one's understanding of the activity in question, including one's best understanding of what good practice of the relavant kind involves.
There is no way to classify a requirement of chess without consulting thoes who play and relying on one's understanding of the game.
We can only make a judgment about what reasoning is by drawing on our best udnerstanding of what the activity involves.
We can only answer by carrying out practical reasoning, explicating what we discover and subjecting those discoveries to scrutiny.

## The intelligbility argument

The question then is why constructivism is not ultimately a form of conventionalism, like chess.
We can critically evaluate any conventional practice in behavior/reasoning.
Any truly *reasoned* practical judgment would be open to such evaluation.
This undercuts variance with subjective conditions and establishes objectivity.

Imagine we discovered creatures who exhibited patterns of thought radically different than any we could recognize as valid reasoning.
According to the Inlligibility Argument, such beings would not intelligibly count as engaged in the activity of reasoned practical judgment.
Thus, we do not have to explain how their thought is invalid reasoning.
They do not qualify as engaged in practical reasoning to begin with.
E.g., someone who decides to be a lawyer rather than a doctor because she had a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch.
E.g., someone who judges that some painful experiences are not bad because they occur on a Tuesday.

Constructivism also rejects "protagorean relativism", which says that ethical truth is relative to *actual* human reasoning practice.
Imagine we have a case of a framework of dissimilar thinking that we are trying to evaluate. 
There can be cases unlike the above, unlike where there is insufficient compliance with what we recognize as practical reasoning.
There can be cases where the framework cannot be wholly disqualified.
In those cases, the argument shifts to an *internal* argument.
Either the dissimilar patterns can be internally validated based on deeper argreement with familiar reasoning norms.
Or the imagined patterns might be internally validated, based on internal claims about what full understanding of practical reasoning involves.

Objectivity will arguably depend on interpersonal reality. 
To engage in practical reasoning is to speak for humanity about the case at hand.
Thus, one incurs a responsibility of due deference in the face of disagreement.
Reasoned disagreement counts as pro tanto grounds that some party has fallen at least in partial error. 
Constructivism entails that the truth of an ethical proposition requires the ability to cite unreason as the source of ethical disagreement.
If this cannot be mantained, then there is no truth of the matter in the proposition at hand.
