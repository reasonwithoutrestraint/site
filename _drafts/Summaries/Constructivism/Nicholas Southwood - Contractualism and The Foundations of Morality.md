# Chapter 4 - The structure of deliberative contractualism

According to deliberative con- tractualism, morality’s foundations are to be located in facts about what common code we would agree to live by if we were, as I shall put it, perfectly deliberatively rational. The deliberative rationality of a course of action is a matter of its being the outcome of deliberation with othersin which the agent fullycomplies with relevantdeliberative norms, where these norms are taken to be presuppositions of the activity of deliberation itself.

Deliberative contractualism offers a characterization of the moral point of view that is neither distastefully personal nor oppressively impersonal, but genuinely interpersonal. To embrace the interpersonal point of view, as I shall call it, is neither to view the world through the inescapably subjective lens of one’s own beliefs, goals, hopes, fears, commitments, and so on; nor is it to view the world as a merely disinterested and impartial observer in which the personal and partial have been transcended and all subjectivity cast off. Rather, it is to view the world from the standpoint of a participant in an intersubjective process involving other persons who are distinct but similarly situated

## 4.1 Deliberative Rationality

Three conditions must therefore be satisfied in order for a decision to count as deliberatively rational: 
1. First, agents must engage in deliberation with relevant others prior to making the decision. 
2. Second, in doing so they must fully comply with relevant deliberative norms. 
3. Third, the decision must be based on the outcome of such deliberation.

### Deliberation

In order to be deliberatively rational a decision to act must be preceded by deliberation with others who are affected by the decision. In short, according to the deliberative conception, rationality is necessarily an interpersonal achievement. What, then, does the kind of interpersonal engagement constitutive of deliberation with others amount to? 

1. First, it has a communicative aspect. The communicative aspect of deliberation is oriented towards the free and open exchange of relevant information.
2. Second, deliberation has a discursive aspect. If the communicative aspect of deliberation is oriented towards the free and open exchange of relevant information, the discursive aspect is oriented towards persuasion, argumentation, and ultimately consensus. In discourse, deliberators do not endeavour to reach mutual understanding, but rather to argue with and persuade one another to act in this way or that, while remaining amenable to being persuaded in turn.
3. Third, deliberation has a reflective aspect. The reflective aspect of deliberation is oriented towards self-exploration and self-interrogation, on the one hand – working out and rendering coherent the content of one’s beliefs and desires, hopes and fears, goals and commitments – and towards self-transformation, on the other – reorienting this content in light of communication and discourse.

### Deliberative Norms

The deliberation that precedes an agent’s decision to act must fully comply with relevant deliberative norms. At a first approximation, deliberative norms are simply procedural norms that are applicable to deliberation with others. They are procedural in the sense that they impose procedural rather than substantive constraints on deliberation. They make demands on the form deliberation must take, not on the substance of its content or output. 

More specifically, deliberative norms must constitute a special kind of norm: one in which deliberative considerations are somehow central to the kind of normative appraisal that the norm licenses. (By analogy, epistemic norms are not merely norms that apply to beliefs, but a kind of norm in which epistemic considerations such as truth and evidence are central).

1. Communicative norms: some that apply to deliberators qua *communicators*, others that apply to deliberators qua *communicatees*. Norms qua communicators:
	- Sincerity - requiring them to communicate only believed truths 
	- Effective transmission - requiring communicators to make a good-faith attempt to make themselves understood to communicatees 
	- Communicative relance - requiring communicators to communicate all and only considerations that they take to be relevant.
	- Openness - requiring communicatees to be open to communication; 
	- Effective reception - requiring communicatees to make a genuine and good-faith attempt to understand what is being communicated to them
	- Communicative rectification - requiring communicatees to take certain steps to solicit communication in cases where communicators are unable (but not terminally) and/or unwilling.
2. Discursive norms: 
	- Persuasion - requiring deliberators endeavour to persuade others of the wisdom of their respective points of view, rather than, say, engaging in threats, bribery, or flattery. 
	- Norm of reciprocity - requiring deliberators to endeavour to present considerations for and against in a manner that their fellow deliberators are capable of regarding as normatively salient.
	- Adaptiveness - requiring deliberators to aim to be capable of being persuaded insofar as they take considerations advaced to warrant it.
3. Reflective norms: 
	- Internal exploration - requires individuals to determine what they actually think: what they believe, desire, hope, fear, and so on.
	- Internal coherence - requires deliberators to endeavour to identify and eliminate inconsistencies in the relevant class of psychological states

## 4.2 Inputs to Deliberation

The inputs to deliberation encompas the full range of attitudes that are constitutive of our particular first-personal standpoints. Our standpoints are ones in which we are invested and describe what matters to us. They can be thought of as the lens through which the world is represented in evaluative terms. This includes desires as well as normative judgments about what is important, valuable, worthwhile, judicious, what we/others have reason to do. This even includes *moral* judgments, although such judgments are likely to hold any persuasive weight within the procedure. There should be no other a priori restrictions to the inputs, e.g. don't restrict aggregative claims, or epistemically disreputable claims.

## 4.3 Output: A common code to live by

Deliberative consequentialism states that the output of the deliberative contractual situation is a common code to live by. Deliberative contractualism is a two-level moral theory. By ‘a common code’ is
meant a relatively comprehensive set of common principles, permitting,
forbidding, and requiring certain conduct in certain circumstances.

- Principles = anonymous, general, conclusive prescriptions (or conditional deontic propositions).
- Anonymous => it must be possible to formulate the principles without the use of what would be intuitively recognized as proper names, or rigged definite descriptions.
- General => the principles pick out types of acts in types of circumstances rather than token acts in particular concrete circumstances.
- Conclusive => the principles do not merely recommend, but forbid and require, courses of actions.
- Common principles => principles that both have a common content and are applicable to all affected and deliberatively competent members of the current generation.
- Comprehensive => a coherent system of prescriptions that regulate a relatively extensive domain of conduct, as opposed, say, to principles that regulate specific domains such as those that comprise professional codes of conduct.

Some important questions:

1. In agreeing to live by prnciples, deliberative contractors are agreeing to *accept* rather than merely *comply with* principles. Compliance merely involves acting in accordance with the relevant principles. Acceptance of rules also involves the disposition to encourage others to comply with them, to form favourable attitudes toward others who comply with them, dispositions to feel guilt or shame when one breaks them and to resent others’ breaking them, all of which dispositions and attitudes being supported by a belief that they are justified.
2. The principles that comprise codes will be open-ended in character, requiring individuals to exercise judgment and discretion. As opposed to them being principles that must be followed mechanically and unquestionally.
3. Should facts about the actual probably acceptance of the principles play a formal role in constraining deliberative contractors' choices? No they should not. One reason for thinking they should is that we need to account for circumstances when the people don't follow the principles. But we can merely decide principles that are conditional on circumstances where people do and do not obey the principles.
