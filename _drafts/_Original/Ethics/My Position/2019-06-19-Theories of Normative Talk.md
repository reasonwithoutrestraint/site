## The problem

Now that we have illustrated what I take to be the main features of normative judgments, we can now return to the original task.
We can now attempt to characterize the kind of attitude involved in *deliberative endorsement*. 
Is it more like a belief which represents some kind of normative reality?
Or is it more like a desire that disposes agents to behave in certain ways?
When one makes a normative judgment, is this judgment capable of being true or false?
If normative judgments are like beliefs, what are they attempting to represent?
If they are like desires, then what kind of motivational states are they?

The characterization has to be one that can be applied to the normative judgments of virtually all people.
This universal characterization is required because it is necessary to ground a shared concept, and a shared concept is necessary for the genuine disagreements we have with others. 
Otherwise, these "disagreements" wouldn't really be disagreements, we would just be talking past each other with different concepts.
E.g. if "good" for Adam meant "approved by society" and "good" for Bob meant "approved by God", then when Adam says "X is good" and Bob says "No, X is not good", what is really happening is Adam is saying "X is approved by society" and Bob is saying "No, X is not approved by God". 
But this characterization of normative judgment clearly does not allow for a disagreement (there is no contradiction with X being approved by society and X not be approved by God).
Since Adam and Bob clearly do disagreement when one says "X is good" and the other says "No, X is not good" (i.e. Adam and Bob both judge that the other person is *incorrect*), this characterization does not suffice.

Possible characterizations can be broadly seperated into two categories - world-to-mind states of mind and mind-to-world states of mind.
Both are states of mind that that have propositional content as their objects, i.e. agents have beliefs and desires with regard to p where p is some proposition. 
Mind-to-world states of mind are states whereby the propositional content of the attitude is meant to *correspond* to an external reality. 
E.g. if one believes that p, then p is aimed at corresponding to reality. 
World-to-mind states of mind are states whereby the agent is disposed to modify the world so that the propositional content of the attitude is made true. 
E.g. if one desires that p, then they are disposed to try to make it the case that p is true. 
Whereas mind-to-world states have a *correspondence* role, world-to-mind states have a *dispositional* or *functional* role regarding one's motivations.

How do we determine whether an attitude has a mind-to-world direction of fit or a world-to-mind direction of fit?
One test for the direction of fit of an attitude is to determine whether the attitude persists despite observing evidence against the propositional content of the attitude. 
For example, someone's belief in p will tend to diminish upon observing evidence against p. 
E.g. if someone *believes* that their home football team will win the game tonight, this will (usually) tend to diminish as they observe evidence that the team will lose, e.g. if the home team loses their best player, then this will diminish one's belief they they will win. 
On the other hand, if one *desires* that their home team win, then this attitude (usually) does not tend to diminish upon observing that the team will lose, e.g. if the home team loses their best player, then this will *not* diminish one's desire that they win.
Like most desires, the desire here persists despite evidence against the truth of the corresponding propositional content.

It seems clear to me that normative attitudes have a world-to-mind direction of fit.
That is, when a person endorses A's adoption of attitude X, this does not tend to diminish as one learns that A fails to adopt attitude X.
This to me lends evidence to a non-cognitive analysis of normative judgments.
This implies that normative judgments are not *beliefs* or other cognitive states that represent a normative reality. 
Rather, they are sophisticated forms of desire-like states (or dispositions to have certain desire-like states).
However, other theories of normative talk purport to explain the appearances better. 

In this piece, I will be examining the main competing characterizations of normative thought.
I begin by analyzing varieties of mind-to-world, or *representation*, characterizations.
These would be *cognitive* theories because they suggest that that our normative judgments are capable of being true or false.
These theories posit that there exists a normative reality of normative entities, properties, relations, etc. which our normative judgments are aiming to properly represent. 
E.g. there exists a property *goodness* which are attempting to refer to when we judge that something is "good".
E.g. there is a relation of *oguht* that holds between agents and attitudes that we aim to reference when we judge that an agent "ought" to adopt an attitude.
These cognitive theories can be split into two variants - non-naturalism and naturalism.
Naturalism posits that the normative properties are natural properties. 
"Natural" here is meant to describe properties that belong to the subject-matter of physics and can be discovered a posteriori.
Under naturalism, the normative *properties* just are reducible to ordinary non-normative natural *properties*.
On some strong versions of naturalism, normative *concepts* can also be reduced to natural *concepts*.
While naturalism is often taken to imply Naturalistic *Moral Realism*, the label is sometimes often used for non-realist theories as well.
For purposes here, I will take naturalism to include all cognitive theories that don't involve non-natural normative properties.
Non-naturalism includes all cognitive theories which are not natural.
This means that normative properties cannot be reduced to "natural" properties.
Normative properties are not the subject-matter of physics or science and must be discovered a priori.
Normative properties and concepts cannot be reduced to non-normative or natural properties and concepts.

In the end, I will argue that all cognitive theories fail, either for failing to satisfy the features of normative thought that I mentioned earlier or because of other problems that they bring.
I then present non-cognitivism as a viable alternative to the failed theories and argue why it does not suffer from similar issues as the earlier theories and also give positive reason to accept it.
I end by considering some objections to non-cognitivism.

## Naturalism

### Analytic reductionism

- "A would have a certain pro-attitude with regard to X in circumstances C" where C is given a non-normative characterization.
"A ought to X" = "A desires to do X" or "A desires to desire to do X" or "A would desire X if fully informed"

*Open Question Argument*. (1) Any proposed analytic reduction of a term must be uninformative and obvious. (2) Any analytic reduction of goodness would be informative and nonobvious. (3) Therefore, there can be no analytic reduction of moral terms. Consider the question "Is X good". Now, imagine that a proposed complex analysis of goodness states that all questions of the form 'Is X good' are questions of the form 'Does X have naturalistic property Y'. The problem with this is that, we can always further ask "Is it good that X has property Y". This further question is clearly intelligible and coherent. But, if goodness that could be analyzed in terms of Y, then such a question would not be intelligible.

*Descriptive beliefs don't entail normative judgments*. If M and N are *definitionally* identical, then if A *believes* that X has property M, then it logically follows that A also *believes* X has property N (and vice-versa). Note that this is stronger than mere *property* identity, e.g. H2O might be identical to water, but the fact that A believes water is H2O does not logically entail that A believes it is water (or vice-versa). However, this logical relation does not hold between and normative property and any natural property. If we know that A believes that X has natural property N and he later says that "X has moral property M", then we have always learned something new about A.

Response: deny that all analytic reductions must be trivial and uninformative. Counter: Explain why the normative instance of the paradox of analysis differs from other cases. Normative judgments are supposed to provide reasons for action. In other cases, we would be fine to abandon the terms being analyzed (i.e. no problem switching from "knowledge" to "justified true belief"). But this is not true in the normative case.

*Insistence on Normative Language*. If normative term N really meant natural term M, then why not carry on making claims about M? If the thesis were true, this would be equivalent to making claims about N, so there should be no difference. The fact that one chooses not to do so implies either (1) he believes that there really is something about N not captured in M, or (2) he believes that society believes that there is something about N not captured in M. Either way, either he or society believes that N and M are not analytically equivalent.

*Normativity reduced to Tautology*. While it may be appropriate for an analytic reduction to be nontrivial, it is not appropriate that an analytic reduction could ever provide one with a *reason* for action. If normative concept M can be analytically reduced to natural concept N, then saying "N is M" would be a tautology, and thus could provide no reason for action. For example, if goodness could be analytically reduced to pleasure, then if someone said "pleasure is good", then this would be equivalent to saying "pleasure is pleasure" or "goodness is goodness". But presumably the claim "pleasure is good" is supposed to provide someone with reason for action. But no tautology such as "pleasure is pleasure" or "goodness is goodness" could ever provide a reason or motive for someone to promote pleasure.

*Ethical disagreements reduced to disputed semantics or descriptions.* If analytic naturalism is true, then two parties disagree ethically only if they disagree descriptively. But people can disagree ethically without disagreeing descriptively. There can be two people who represent reality identically without having similar ethical attitudes with regard to that representation. This can only be explained by positing that the two parties have different semantics, but then this wouldn't even be a genuine disagreement. This means that two societies with ethical terms that had different semantic meaning (but were identical in that those terms guided the respective society's behavior) would not really disagree with each other. They would be talking passed one another.

*Subjectivist forms don't allow disagreement*. Note that reducing ethical judgments to *beliefs about attitudes* cannot account for this. If A believes he desires X and B believes he desires not-X, then these beliefs are not in disagreement because they can both be *correct*. E.g. A saying "X is good" and B saying "X is not good" would not be a contradiction, since it would amount to "A desires X" and "B does not desire X". In fact, they would both be *true*. But it seems that ethical disagreement can persist despite accepting these truths. 

*Objectivist forms don't explain motivation*. See below.

### Synthetic reductionism 

*A Priori Argument*. It seems we can come to learn about normative truths a priori. This is inexplicable if there is an a posteriori synthetic relationship between normative facts and non-normative facts. I.e. we cannot learn a priori that yellow is such and such wavelength, or that water is H2O. Yet how can it be the case that we can learn a priori that, e.g. some natural property *necessarily* co-instantiates a normative property? 

*Lack of Disagreement*. Synthetic identities can be found in other domains because we can easily fix the referrents of terms like "water" or "yellow", and then we can find that property that is always instantiated with that referrent. One strategy for doing this is to present a dispositional analysis: an entity is "yellow" just in case it causes sensation that we normally perceive as "yellow". Such a dispositional analysis is not promising for moral terms. Imagine that two societies are lingustically identical except when one society used the word "good" they referred to pleasure and the other society referred to God's will. On this reading, the two cultures wouldn't even disagree with each other, since the content of "good" in these two societies are different - they are using the same word to track different phenomenon. But it seems that these cultures can coherently disagree with each other, especailly if they each act in accordance with what is good.
 
### Non-reductionism
- Succeeds!
- Although it doesn't actually suffice to give a theory.
- Synthetic and Analytic

## Non-naturalism

The lack of influence that normative properties place on the world pose the following three problems:

1. **Concept**: _There is no evolutionary benefit to developing a capacity to track these properties_. In order for there to be a benefit in developing a perceptual faculty, that faculty must be useful at increasing an organism's biological fitness. The only perceptual faculties useful in increasing an organism's biological fitness are faculties that track relevant natural facts, as natural facts are the only facts that influence an organism's chance at reproducing. 
2. **Epistemology**: _We have no epistemic access to non-natural facts_. It is a necessary condition on justified belief that one's belief be explained by the facts in question. Perceptions of natural facts are good evidence for natural properties not because of an intrinsic connection between *perceiving* p and p being true. Rather, *perceiving* p is good evidence for p only if p *being true* causally exlpains why one perceives p. The reliable causal connection between *p being true* and *perceiving p* is required to treat *perceiving p* as a relibable detection of p. There is no way that a non-natural fact p could ever causally explain how we perceive or judge p to be true. Thus, we cannot treat our judging that non-natural fact p as evidence that p is true. This means none of our normative beliefs are ever justified.
3. **Ontology**: _Parsimony is preferrable to complexity with regard to ontology_. When determining which entities exist in the world, we should use inference to the best explanation. Theories with fewer assumptions and better explanatory power are superior. Imagine a world without any non-natural properties but with all the same natural properties. These two worlds would have equal explanatory power, but the world without unneeded properties would have less assumptions and would therefore be superior. The reason is because non-natural properties must be causally inert. The existing of non-natural properties is not necessary to explain reality as we see it.

It seems to be an a priori conceptual truth that moral properties supervene on the non-moral properties, i.e. two circumstances which have identical non-moral properties must also have identical moral properties. This can be easily explained by naturalism, but it is difficult to see how this is explained by non-naturalism. There are two issues here, one epistemological and one ontological.

1. **Epistemology**: When we see an action that we judge to be wrong, we don't just judge it to be wrong in that particular circumstance. We judge that a particular action with certain natural properties always coinstantiates normative properties. Non-naturalism purports that we perceive the non-natural moral facts as we perceive certain natural facts. But there is nothing about this perceptual model that *necessarily guarantees* that we will perceive the same moral facts in circumstances where we perceive the same natural facts. Any perceived supervenience would be, at best, a posteriori; the supervenience relation couldn't be perceived, for have only perceived the one circumstance Thus, the perceptual model of non-naturalism cannot explain the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral.
2. **Ontology**: It is a *conceptual* truth that the normative supervenes on the non-normative. No two worlds can have the same non-normative properties yet have different normative properties. Thus, normative properties and non-normative properties are not just coextensive, they are *necessarily* coexstensive; they are coexstensive in all possible worlds. However, there are no distinct properties that are coextensive in all possible worlds. If two properties are distinct, then there must be *some* possible worlds where only one of the properties obtain. Thus, normative properties, *if they are properties*, must be natural.

## General Problems for cognitivism

*Motivation*. One can infer that an agent has a world-to-mind fit state of mind with respect to X if they judge that they have normative reason to X. With moral judgments, this is particularly true if they *exclaim* that a certain action is (im)moral. This is easy to explain if judgments of normative reasons are themselves world-to-mind fits. Otherwise, this is difficult to explain. Attributions of goodness to P have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any (non-)naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are *necessarily* action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only *contingently* action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent. Non-naturalism fails to account for the motivational feature of normative judgments for the very same reasons that mind-independent naturalism fails. The fact that moral properties move from the natural realm to the non-natural realm does not increase the motivational weight. If such properties did not have motivational force, how can they gain a motivational force by postulating that they cannot be investigated by the hard sciences?

*Translation* Imagine we are trying to translate words for descriptive concepts to another language. This involves picking an extension of the relevant concept that we can all agree with and finding the word from the other language that correlates with this extension. For example, if we want to find the translation for the word "red", we would establish an extension of the concept RED - e.g. blood, stop signs, crayons, etc. Then we would find which word in the other language is often used to refer to the entities in that extension. On the other hand, we cannot do this for normative terms. Firstly, it is doubtful that we could establish an extension of any normative concept that we all agree on. But, more importantly, even if we could, it would not be enough to find the foreign word that corresponds to this extension in order to translate the term. We would also need to know the other society's motivational and non-cognitive attitudes and dispositions with regard to the extension. For, it is conceivable that they could think that the extensions was either good or bad. This attacks all forms of non-naturalism and objectivist forms of naturalism.
-> Also imagine a culture with an identical nonverbal language of our own except that they didn't speak verbally. They used sign language predominantly to communicate. Some analysis of their movements would be reducible to expressions of beliefs. How would we analyze the meaning of showing a middle finger? How would we analyze a parent who angrily points at a child's bedroom (ordering him to go)? Imagine they needed to express more sophisticated thoughts using this language. Is it truly questionable whether they could express the entire range of human attitudes, including the attitudes themselves, dispositions to have the attitudes, endorsement of the attitudes? Is it questionable whether questionable whether they could use their language in a way to influence the behavior of others? Would we have any need to posit the existence of mind-independent action-guiding properties to explain the phenomenon? Would it change if they spoke verbally?

*Disagreement*. Descriptivism cannot explain the role of attitude in ethical disagreements. There are two forms of disagreement, (1) disagreements in belief (both cannot be true) and (2) disagreement in attitudes (cannot be satisfied). Note that reducing ethical judgments to *beliefs about attitudes* cannot account for this (see above). Ethical disagreements commonly feature disagreements in attitudes and in beliefs. But attitudes play the primary role because (1) The attitudes determine which beliefs are relevant, and (2) Ethical disagreement persist after agreement in belief. Perhaps this is actually a disagreement in beliefs about each agent's idealized attitudes, where idealized attitudes are assumed to be convergent. Disagreement in idealized attitudes maybe can account for disagreements in certain normative domains, e.g. disagreements in desires, emotions, maybe even beliefs (i.e. we think other people would come to similar beliefs as us under idealized conditions, because our epistemic frameworks are assumed to be similar). But ethical disagreement can persist despite agreement about the beliefs of everyone's fully rational, fully informed attitudes. This is not the case with something like think art, humor, taste, etc. This is because ethical judgments have a *prescriptive* aspect in that they are meant to guide the behavior of other agents. Such prescriptions cannot *both* be actualized when they conflict.

*Expanded Twin Earth*. What our terms refer is a contingent matter that depends upon our culture and history. It is a feature of our contingent culture that we happened to have hooked up the term "good" with any particular natural or non-natural property good. So, imagine that a group of people whom you disagreed with merely stipulated that what they meant by "good" was not the (natural or non-natural) property that you refered to by "good" and they went on using their terms to regulate their behavior in their society. It still seems that you would disagree with them and think that they were incorrect.

## Non-cognitivism

- Succeeds on all fronts!
- Biggest issue is the linguistic/semantic issues.
- It doesn't explain what the base attitudes are.

More on ethical disagreement:
- Attitudes determine which beliefs are relevant to a disagreement.
- Attitudes determine when the disagreement is resolved.

Kinds of attitudes when S says "A ought to X":
- Expression of endorsement
	- S endorses a pro-attitude for A X-ing
	- S endorses X-ing in A's circumstances
- Prescriptions
	- S prescribes X to A

"X is wrong" =>
- Expressive
	- of attitudes, e.g. disapproval of X
	- of dispositions:
		- of attitudes, e.g. disapproval of X
		- of behavior, e.g. tendency to not 
	- of endorsement
		- of the above cognitive states
- Prescriptive
	- influence the attitudes of others

### Attitude

#### Expressive

One aspect of normative judgments is that they express world-to-mind fit attitudes, some of the attitudes associated with the belief-based theories. The difference is that instead of *reporting* those attitudes, normative judgments *express* those attitudes. It's why it would be fair to *infer* (not in the sense of logical inference) that someone has a particular attitude given their normative statements, but we cannot *deduce* their attitudes given such a statement. This is similar to how assertions can *express* a subject's belief even though they do not *report* an agent's beliefs. E.g. if someone says "P is true", it would not be a contradiction for them to say "I do not believe P". This is strange, because the belief is *expressed* but not *reported* by assertions. In the same way, certain attitudes are *expressed* but not *reported* with normative judgments. 

Sometimes, normative statements express straightforwardly ordinary attitudes. For example, if someone says "X is funny", this can commonly be read as expressing an attitude of amusement. When someone says, "good", that can be read as expressing an attitude of desire or approval. Similar considerations can be said about reasons-statements in general, i.e. if someone says there is reason to hold attitude X, this oftentimes simply expresses that the agent holds the attitude in question. Also, instead of straightforwardly expressing an attitude, such normative statements can also express *dispositions* to have certain attitudes. So when someone says that X is wrong, this need not necessarily express the attitude of blame or resentment in that particular moment. Rather, it can express a *tendency* to blame or resent X in normal circumstances.

#### Deliberative Endorsement

However, this is not all there is to all normative judgments. There are times when a person judges themselves to have reason to adopt attitude X without actually adopting X (and perhaps even without a tendency to adopt X). Indeed, one can take a step back and question their attitudes at any given moment. It is a common feature of human life that we have attitudes that we renounce, and that we endorse attitudes that we lack. It is common for there to be a disconnect between the attitudes we *actually* hold and the attitudes we think we have *reason to* hold. This suggests that there is a special attitude involved in a normative judgment in favor of X can be distinct from the attitude of holding X itself. This is the attitude of *deliberative endorsement*. This state of mind is essential to normative thinking, and is often what we express with normative statements. 

This attitude is what grounds a common subject matter in all normative concepts. Without this attitude of deliberative endorsement, there would be very little in common involved in judging that a fear, desire, belief, anger, etc. were justified. These would just be expressions of different ordinary attitudes or dispositions. However, what's common to all these judgments (or what can be common) is that the ordinary attitudes can be the object of a single attitude - endorsement. This is not to say that e.g. the psychology of judging that e.g. anger is reasonable is exactly the same as judging that e.g. a belief is reasonable. Clearly they are different - the former expresses (but doesn't *report*) that the agent has disposition to feel anger in the given circumstances and the latter expresses that the agent probably adopts the belief in question. However, the point is that the attitude of deliberative endorsement is an attitude common to both of these judgments.

This kind of attitude is found only in creatures with higher order thinking (i.e. thoughts about thoughts) as it is an attitude *about* other attitudes; the *object* of the endorsement is one's attitudes. E.g. one endorses or (renounces) their fear, anger, resentment, desires, etc. Because of this, normative judgments of this kind are probably only present in humans (and perhaps some very rare outliers of others species). Whereas an animal acts according to its desires and believes according to its perceptions, humans have the capacity to step back from their desires/perceptions (and attitudes in general) and question whether those initial attitudes constitute reasons for action/belief, and (if the initial attitudes are normatively assessable) whether there is reason to adopt those initial attitudes. 

There may be a sense in which a person can have unreflective endorsement of their attitudes. For example, if you asked a thoughtless person what they think they should do, they might quickly respond with an action that satisfies their most present desires. They might never actually take a step back and question whether they endorsed their desire or whether they have reason to hold the desire. They might never question *why* they have that desire or what kind of reason they have to pursue the object of that desire. They might never investigate the relevant features of the object of the desire that grounds the reasons. They may never question whether the desire provides them with reason for action. They might never consider how that desire conflicts with other desires that they approve of and what kind of importance or priority the desire should have relative to other reasons he acknowledges. But since they do approve of their desire in a trivial sense, they can be said to endorse their desire in a weak sense. While this oftentimes does happen with normative judgments/statements, this is somewhat similar to the case of a person who expresses straightforwardly non-normative attitudes. This is not the essential feature of normative judgments, which is endorsement after reflection and questioning what one actually takes to be a reason.

#### Prescriptive

There is another core element to normative judgments in addition to *expressing* deliberative endorsement. That is their function at *evoking* the attitudes of others. Thus, there is an *expressive* component and a *prescriptive* component to normative judgments. The prescriptive component is particularly strong for moral judgments. When someone judges that X is wrong, they are expressing a lot of attitudes: they endorse not performing X, they endorse blaming anyone who does X, etc. But it also serves to influence the attitudes of others around them; it is using language as a tool to cause others to refrain from doing X, to blame anyone does X, to incite guilt in anyone who does X, etc. This is the second way that non-cognitivism expands the role of normative langauge. The considerations mentioned earlier showed how normative judgments are extended from expressions of mind-to-world state beliefs to expressions of world-to-mind state attitudes. Now, we see how normative language is extended even further, from a tool for *expressing* attitudes to a tool for *inciting* attitudes.

### Language

1. Emotive Language
2. Normative education (Descriptivism.md)
3. Evolution -> Non-cognitivism necessary and sufficient

Concepts that become used emotively (thick ethical concepts?):
- (Real) Man
- Son, E.g. when a father disowns a son, he says "You are not my son". How does this make sense? Because calling someone a "son" doesn't just describe an ancestral relationship. In our culture, it is implicitly tied to a normative judgment that certain attitudes are appropriate for anyone in this relationship (e.g. to be loving, to care for each other's interests, to assist one another). But if one abandons these attitudes and no longer sees them as appropriate, they also refuse to ascribe the concept as well.
- Cool
- racist

Some of these may have descriptive references, but given that they can be used emotively, people can use them in ways independent of their descriptive reference. E.g. A real man provides for his family, there's nothing cool about taking unnecessary blows in a boxing match, a real nigga doesn't go to prison, white nationalist arguing that they aren't racist, etc. These are all normative expressions because they are ignoring the reference of these terms and instead using them as they are useful for expressing certain dynamic content. These are concepts that regulate specific attitudes in that they express them and prescribe them to others. Saying that a real man does X expresses the imperative that man ought to do X. Saying X is cool expresses the imperative that we ought to appreciate and celebrate someone who does X, etc. 

Why there is objective purport? Why not have our language just be "Boo!" and "Yay!"
- Evolutionary advantages: Objective prescriptions more likely to be adopted by others
- Subject-verb form statements allow for more precision/clarity. We find it already with phrases like "that's a tasty dish" instead of saying "mmmm"

### Truth

Indispensability argument for normative truth

The theory of truth should be such that any agent who accepts its truth abides by the above considerations. I.e. a theory which says "A ought to X iff relation R holds between A and X" implies that any agent who accepts relation R is disposed to follow the above considerations regarding ubiquity, motivation, reasoning, and disagreement.

Third-personal normative judgments. When A judges that B ought to X, how is this to be analyzed? Is it, A, from his own perspective, endorsing B having the attitude? Or is it A imagining what he would endorse if in B's perspective? Both can occur. The former is an external reasons judgment (expressive, prescriptive, speaker-endorsement) whereas the latter is an internal reasons judgment (constructivism, explanatory, subject-endorsement). There are two normative concepts we use. It makes sense to say "the capitalist ought to raise prices that maximize his profits" (in the sense that it would be irrational to do otherwise, a normative conception) and to say "the capitalize ought not to just maximize his profits" (not that it would be irrational, but in that it is not endorsed from the speaker's perspective). 
-> Internal personal reasons: the only reasons that do not entail a subject-indexed reasons. E.g. on external reason judgment (focused around speaker endorsement), we can never say "R is a reason for A to X". We would have to say "R is a reason for A to X, from B's perspective". This is not useful.
-> Do the above considerations (ubiquity, motivation, disagreement, and reasoning) apply to both internal and external reasons. For subject-endorsed normative judgments, they always apply (e.g. external reasons). For subject-endorsed reasons, they apply when the speaker is the subject (i.e. someone is deciding what they ought to do). What about 3rd party subject-endorsed reasons? Do they entail a form of motivation or disagreement? Perhaps under a universal conception of reasons (see Michael Smith), we can account for disagreement. Perhaps we can also account for speaker-motivation - i.e. when S says "A ought to X", the speaker would be motivated to do X in A's circumstances. Thus, we have the following:
	- A believes "I ought to X" 
		-> Judgment: A is motivated to X
		-> Truth: A would be motivated to X insofar as he is rational
	- S believes "A ought to X"
		-> External Judgment: S is disposed to have pro-attitude with regard to A doing X
		-> External Truth: 
			- S would be motivated to have the pro-attitude with regard to A doing X insofar as S is rational 
			- Appeal to the features constituitive of the pro-attitude that A holds. 
			- Can this avoid speaker-indexed truth? Maybe not, but that's okay.
		-> Internal Judgment: S is disposed to be motivated to X in A's circumstances
		-> Internal Truth: 
			- Option 1: S would be motivated to X in A's circumstances insofar as S is rational [speaker-indexed truth, weird]
				-> What does "circumstances" even mean? It has to include the desires, goals, interests, etc. of A. Does it include all of his motivations? 
			- Option 2: A would be motivated to X insofar as A is rational
				--> Perhaps both can be accepted, if we have a universal conception of reasons???
		-> Thus, all are based on speaker endorsement and what's rational for the speaker, Just one is concerned with whether the pro-attitude of the speaker is appropriate and one is concerned with whether the hypothetical behavior of the speaker in certain circumstances are appropriate.
		-> Not sure if a fully universal conception of reasons is necessary. Perhaps we just need enough objectivity to have meaningful disagreements.

Explantory/Motivational/Internal aspect (some belong here, some belong in Normative Correctness.md):
- Psychological: They would not have evolved if they were not motivational. Beliefs are not necessarily motivational but they are still evolutionarily advantageous as they are about the real world, which influences are reproductive ability.
- Rationality: Even if we have an external reason to adopt an attitude, we need an internal/procedural characterization of reasons because there needs to be a method for us to determine what to do when we don't have access to those external reasons. E.g. there is some external reason for all of us to hold beliefs that are true, but we may be completely cut off from which beliefs are true. We only know which are justified given our sensory input - and so we need an internal conception of reasons to articulate the nature of this justification. The same goes for external reasons for action like kindness or generosity, etc. We might be cut off from this. It might be argued we are not cut off from this. We are aware of what kindness is, and we know what it is to be kind, so we have access. But this is just like saying we know what P is and we know what it is to believe P, so if P is true then we have reason to believe P, because we have access. But this is clearly wrong. That P is true cannot itself be a reason that anyone accepts as a reason to believe P. Likewise, than an action exhibits kindndess is no reason to perform that action.
- Irrationality: There is a conception of reasons such that insofar as one accepts that they have reason to X yet fail to X they are being irrational.  
- Motivational: when one judges that they ought to X, this produces are motivation to X insofar as they are rational. But this is only true under the internalist conception of reasons. But this can only true (necessarily) if they accept that X is the rational extension of their current normative stance. I.e. its only true if they acknowledge that X is the rational extension of their current normative stance and fail to do X (internal reason). It would not be true if they acknowledge that X has certain properties which are independent of their current normative stance but which are virtuous or perceieved to be virtuous in some way. One might respond by saying "to be rational" is just to be receptive to reasons. But this is not true, at least not under an externalist conception of reasons. I.e. we wouldn't acuse someone of being irrational just for not believing something that was true, even if it was a priori knowable.
- Ought implies can: To say that A has reason to X implies not just that A is capable of doing X but that A is rationally capable of doing X. E.g. in a weak sense everyone is logically capable of writing genius level papers. However, we wouldn't say everyone is rationally capable of doing such. Thus, we wouldn't say German Jews were irrational for not writing genuis level material to get enough attention to escape the Holocaust. So rational capacity has to be stronger than logical, metaphysical, physical or biological possibility. It's not just as simple as saying "That which is rationally accessible is that which a person would do if they intended". Because it is true of most people that if they intended to write out [insert proof of some theory here], then that person would have written out [insert proof of some theory here]. However, this clearly is not something we are all rationally capable of. In addition to saying "A is rationally capable of doing X so long as A would do X if A intended to", we also have to say "X is rationally accessible to us" where rational accessibility does not apply to something like [insert proof of some theory here]. Note that this may actually be stronger than what an agent has reason to do or what is the rational extension of an agent's given attitudes - e.g. the proof of certain mathematical theories are accessible in the sense that we can deduce them from first principles, but there is a sense that there are not rationally accessible to us. However, it can't be so strong that it only includes whatever action an agent actually does. There are cases where an agent fails to do something that is rationally accessible to them. 
	- The above cases of derivability (but not counterfactual motivation) might lack the accessibility for charges of irrationality.
	- But derivability is sufficient for charges of reasons for/against (counterfactual motivation is not necessary, unless it is *perfect, ideal* counuterfactual motivation. Ideal, perfect counterfactual motivation = derivability?).
--> Three relevant axis regarding action X and agent A:
	- (1) Freedom: Would A X if he intended to? T
	- (2) Accessibility: Is A aware that X is an option? Would he be aware if he applied the appropriate standards to his thinking?
	- (3) Rational accessibility: is A motivated to X (motivating reason)? Would A be motivated to X if he intended to deliberate according to standards he endorses (strong internal reason)? Is X the rational extension of his current motivations (e.g. mathematical proofs derivable, but he might not discover it if he intended to deliberative according to standards he endorses) (weak internal reason)?
- (1) and (3) necessary to have reason to do an action
- (1) and (2) necessary to have free will, i.e. to be blamed for not doing an action, character assessmenets (i.e. assessments of their character). 
- (1), (2) and (3) necessary for charges of irrationality.
- The three pillars? Desire, Belief and Opportunity. Belief + Desire => Intention. Intention + Opportunity => Action. 

### Comparisons with Alternative Theories

Compare non-cognitivism with other theories

*Beliefs and attitudes are logically independent* Take a descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that ascriptions of goodness to x express belief p to x. Take a non-descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that such ascriptions express non-descriptivist attitude q to x. Imagine an agent held q with regard to x but they did not hold p with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they judge x to be good. Now imagine that they held p with regard to x but they did not hold q with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they don't judge to be good.

- Non-naturalism: imagine someone used normative terms with the same extension as normal, competent English speakers. It is possible that someone could do this without sincerely making a normative judgment (or even by making inverse normative judgments) under both non-cognitivism and non-naturalism. They happen to be using the same terms and extension as us, but they *mean* differently and have a different *intension*. I.e. they are using the same terms but expressing different concepts with those terms. Non-cognitivism explains this by the presence or lack of certain attitudes. We can use look at their attitudes to learn whether or not they were using the same concepts. On non-naturalism, it is impossible to know if they had the same meaning. We might try to appeal to their attitudes, but on non-naturalism such attitudes are not necessary. And if they were necessary, then how?
--> Even imagine that someone thought an object had certain normative properties. It is still an open question as to whether someone would endorse/approve or reject/disapprove those properties. I.e. they could have a negative attitude with regard to the normative properties that we take to be good.

Non-cognitivism explains many features
- The Open Question Argument
- The is/ought gap

This analysis of normative statements and normative judgments solves the issues that plagued belief-based theories. 

Firstly, unlike some of the simpler belief-based theories, this analysis can account for familiar normative disagreement. The key issue mentioned earlier with belief-based theories was that it seemed that people could have normative disagreements (especially morally) even if all parties agreed on all of the facts about the world. This can be accounted for with a non-cognitive analysis because normative judgments are not beliefs or other mind-to-world state that represent the world. Rather, they are more akin to plans or some other world-to-mind state that consists of how how one orients themselves in the world. So, two people can have conflicting plans (in the sense that they cannot both be *actualized*), which suffices for normative disagreement, even though they might have identical mind-to-world states.

Secondly, a non-cognitive analysis can be generalized for all normative judgments and statements. As mentioned earlier, there is a core attitude shared among all normative judgments - that is the attitude of deliberative endorsement. Normative concepts differ depending on the object of the endorsement - whether it's a belief, a desire, fear, anger, etc. that is being endorsed. The key element of endorsement is what's shared. 

This analysis avoids any controversial issues regarding the correctness of normative judgments. The reason is that this analysis mantains that normative of judgments don't purport to correspond to an independent normative realm. Because there is no independent normative realm, it doesn't posit a realm that would be the standard for normative judgments. Thus, normative judgments are not actually true or false on this theory, at least not if "true" and "false" are used in the ordinary sense, which is to say correspondence to some independent reality. It may be possible that there is a kind of "correctness" that we can construct for normative langauge that is distinct from the standard of truth for ordinary descriptive judgments, but non-cognitivism doesn't necessarily have any say on the matter.

A non-cognitive analysis also escapes the semantic problems that plague belief-based theories. As mentioned earlier, for any belief-based theory that suggest a definitional reduction between normative property M and natural property N, such a theory implies that if a person believes that an object is M, then we can deduce that the person also believed that the object is N (and vice-versa). In other words, we can deduce normative beliefs from factual beliefs (and vice-versa). Non-cognitive analysis does not suffer from same issue. In fact, it *explains* why the disconnect exists in the first place. Because normative judgments express a world-to-mind fit state whereas factual judgments express a mind-to-world fit, non-cognitivism avoids reducing either domain to the other and explains why any system that attempts to do this is doomed to failure. For any proposed naturalistic properties about an attitude, an agent could either endorse or renounce the attitude in question. Thus, the agent could simultaneously judge themselves to have reason to adopt or not adopt the attitude in question, all without betraying incoherence.

This analysis also explains why normative language is important and inescapable. The reason we still use normative language is because we need to express the attitudes we need to express the world-to-mind fit attitudes that we happen to have. One of the purposes of communications is to allow agents to express their attitudes. Verbal language is one of the many tools to aid in communication (e.g. there's also non-verbal language such as body langauge). All agents must have both mind-to-world fit and world-to-mind fit attitudes. Therefore, there is just as much communicative benefit to expressing world-to-mind fit attitudes as there is for expressing mind-to-world fit attitudes. 

In fact, the communication of non-cognitive attitudes is arguably even more important. Because humans are natural social animals, our success depends in large part on how we are to coordinate and cooperate with one other. Coordination involves the coordination of attitudes. Such coordination will require some sort of tool to express and modify the attitudes of others. Normative language is one such tool to accomplish this. There are, of course, other ways of achieving this, e.g. sticking a middle finger at someone, frowning to someone, crossing your arms with a certain facial expression, etc. can all express anger. The benefit of using language is that it allows for more fine-grained, clear and precise expressions and modifications of one's attitudes. The precision of language even aids in concept-formation as we learn about what our attitudes actually are.
