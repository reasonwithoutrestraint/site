# Summary

This piece is concerned with the definition of good and bad, not with what things are good and what things are bad. Goodness is apparently the only simple concepts in md. While knowing the definition of goodness might not be necessary to form a particular correct moral judgment, it is necessary to establish the reasons supporting or refuting any particular moral judgment, and it is highly unlikely that one can develop a correct *general* moral theory without knowing the meaning of goodness. In this context, the desired definition of goodness is not intended to be the substituting of one word for other words. While any appropriate definition of good must cohere with the sense in which it is ordinarily used, this is not the primary interest. The primary interest is in determining the nature of the *object* or *idea* that the word is generally used to stand for.
