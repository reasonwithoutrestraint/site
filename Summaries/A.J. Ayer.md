# Summary

### Introduction

Ayer held that all meaningful propositions were either analytic or empirical verifiable. The question, then, is to determine whether or not moral propositions are meaningful. This is to be done by determining the definitions of ethical terms. Ayer considers (1) naturalism and (2) non-naturalism as possible theories that define ethical terms.

### Inadequacy of naturalism and non-naturalism

1. According to Ayer, naturalism defines ethical terms in the form of non-ethical terms, e.g. utilitarian theories define goodness in terms of pleasure, happiness, satisfaction, etc; subjectivist theories define goodness in terms of the approval or certain individuals or societies. However, such analysis cannot be correct because for any naturalistic property 'N', it is never *self-contradictory* to say that N is sometimes not good. But this is impossible if there were such a naturalistic property 'N' that 'good' could be defined in terms of. Thus, there is no such naturalistic property 'N' to define 'good', which means naturalism is false.
2. Non-naturalism maintains that ethical concepts are irreducible to empirical concepts. Such a theory must maintain that ethical concepts are controlled by an "intellectual intuitionism". But such a theory cannot be emprically verifiable. Clearly, certain things may seem intuitive to some people but not to others, and there is no verifiable method to choose whose intuitions to trust. Since non-naturalism mantains that ethical propositions are genuine synthetic propositions which are not empirically verifiable, non-naturalism must be false (since, according to Ayer, all meaningful synthetic propositions are empirically verifiable).

### Expressivism

Therefore, moral judgments cannot be expressions of genuine moral propositions capable of being true or false. Rather, moral judgments express particular sentiments. To say that 'X' is wrong is to merely express a certain negative attitude towards stealing. Note that this is not *reporting* one's moral sentiment as in "I do not approve of stealing" (which can be true or false). Rather it is more like uttering "Boo Stealing!!!" (which cannot be true or false). The idea is that moral judgments express feelings about certain objects rather than expressing any assertions about those objects. In addition to expression of speaker's sentiment, moral judgments also function to evoke various sentiments in listeners. Similar arguments can be said of other normative ethical terms and aesthetics. 

### Response to objections

One objection to subjectivist theories ("X is good" = "I approve X") has already been mentioned - it is not self-contradictory to say that one approves of something that is not good, but subjectivist theories would have to maintain that this is self-contradictory. This objection does not apply to Ayer's expressivism, since expressivism does not mantain that *any* moral judgments are self-contradictory (as they hold no meaning whatsoever).

Another objection that applies both to subjectivist theories and Ayer's expressivism is that it cannot account for genuine value disputes. On either theory, when two people make seemingly contradicting assertions of value, they aren't actually expressing incompatible propositions, which means that genuine value disputes are impossible. Ayer responds by denying that people can actually have genuine disputes about value. When people actually engage in evaluative debates, the debates always reduce to factual or logical matters with the presumption of a shared system of values (e.g. arguments consist of one party saying that another has misjudged an agent's motive, that he has misunderstood the effects of a certain action, that he failed to take into account the special circumstances, etc). However, if the two have radically different foundational moral values, then no such argument is possible. Any attempt of convincing by argument is abandoned and instead the argument devolves to derogatory judgments or even to force (if the debate is serious enough). The reason is because one cannot justify their foundational values without themselves appealing to those values, so such an argument is impossible.
