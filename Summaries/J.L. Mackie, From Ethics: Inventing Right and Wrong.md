# The Subjectivity of Values

## Moral Skepticism

There are no objective values. Objective values are not part of the fabric of the world. This includes all moral values - goodness, rightness, duty - as well as nonmoral values such as aesthetic values. Note that this form of moral scepticism is distinct from any first order moral scepticism, such as a view that rejects the practice of expressing judgments, or that rejects conventional moral views of a particular society. This is rather a second order moral scepticism. This is scepticism about the status of moral values and the nature of moral values, and about how these values fit into the world. Further, this is not to say that the properties which are ascribed differential moral values are not distinct; but rather, that there is no objective difference of moral values within those properties.

This moral scepticism is also to be distinguished from moral subjectivist analysis of moral language (i.e. "X is right" means "I approve of X"). The core of this moral scepticism is an ontological thesis, not a linguistic or conceptual thesis. The core of the theory is not especially concerned with giving an analysis of moral language (though this is given as a development, but not a core feature, of the argument). While it may be true that a subjectivist analysis of moral language entails this sort of ontological scepticism, the converse does not hold: One can reject the existence of objective moral values (ontological thesis) while adopting a non-subjectivist analysis of moral language.

## The claim to objectivity

    The main tradition of moral philosophy and much of ordinary thought is committed to the existence of objective moral values. Kant, the rationalist Samuel Clarke the sentimentalist Hutcheson, and Richard Price are given as examples of philosophers committed to objectivity in moral values. As for ordinary thought, there are two main paradigms for analyzing the meaning of moral terms: noncognitivism - whereby moral terms are used to express attitudes, recommendations, or prescriptions - and naturalism - whereby moral terms can be identified with natural descriptive terms.
