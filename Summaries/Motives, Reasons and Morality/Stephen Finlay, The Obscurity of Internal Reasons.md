# The Obscurity of Internal Reasons

## The Standard Argument

Williams's argument has approximately the following form:

For all R, A, X

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A can be motivated to X by believing R.
2. A can be motivated to X by believing R only if there is something in A's motivational set that could bring A to be motivated to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in A's motivational set that could bring A to be motivated to X by believing R.
4. Therefore, there are no external reasons.

There are two elements of ambiguity in this argument:
Firstly, what is the intended sense of *possibility* of A's being rationally motivated, linking premise (1) and (2).
To say that A can be motivated to X is to say that A would be motivated to X under certain circumstances.
The question is what circumstances are characterized here.
If the characterization is too strong (e.g. A's actual circumstances), then premise 1 is implausible and premise 2 is trivial.
It is obvious that the characterization must be "rational motivational", i.e. A would be motivated to X be believing R only insofar as A is rational.
So we need to characterize what is meant by "rational" in this context.

There are two possible readings of the "rational", a broad and narrow sense
Broad sense: to be rational is to have the dispositions of thought that an agent ought ideally to have.
On this interpretation, premise (1) would seem to be a platitude since it is just *ideal rationality*.
Narrow sense: to be rational is to deliberate with *fully imaginative*, *valid* and *sound* thought.
Now premise (1) is no longer a platitude, but a substantive view of rationality that reduces to *sound deliberation*

Secondly, what are the contents of a motivational set, which links premises (2) and (3).
There are two possible readings of the contents of the motivational set.
Narrow sense: the motivational set contains desire-like pro-attitudes that seek that satisfaction of their propositional content.
This would be an *Extended Humean Set* reading.
Broad sense: the motivational set contains anything in an agent's psychological state that is relevant to what he can be motivated to do. 
This contains dispositions to have certain motivations as well.
This is the *Maximally Inclusive Set* reading.

These two interpretative questions combine to form 4 possible interpretations of Williams's argument.

### Ideally Rational + Desire-Like Set

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A is ideally rational.
2. An ideally rational A would be motivated to X by believing R only if A has a desire-like state that could motivate A to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A does not have a desire-like state that could motivate A to X by believing R.
4. Therefore, there are no external reasons.

Premise (1) is an uncontroversial plattitude that would be accepted by everyone.

Note that premise (2) assumes a procedural, Humean instrumentalist view about rationality.
Practical reason is never an independent force of motivation. 
Rather, it facilitates the flow of motivational force from pre-existing desires, channeling it from one object to another.
It does this by discovering how matters of facts or logical inferences are related to one's present desires.
Korsgaard notes that this *motivational* skepticism actually presupposes *normative* content skepticism.
It assumes that rational practical reasoning only endorses the satisfaction of one's present desires.

But this procedural view of rationality is question-begging against externalism.
This rules out substantive views of rationality, which is the basis of externalism.
Externalism can posit that a certain desire-like element is necessary to be ideally rational. 
E.g. concern for others, aversion to pain, desire to respond to reasons, etc.
E.g. McDowell states that becoming rational may require *conversion* rather than *sound deliberation*.
E.g. Millgram states that it might require us to have certain experiences.

### Ideally Rational + Dispositional Set

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A is ideally rational.
2. An ideally rational A would be motivated to X by believing R only if A has a disposition to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A does not have a desire-like state that could motivate A to X by believing R.
4. Therefore, there are no external reasons.

Premise (1) is an uncontroversial plattitude that would be accepted by everyone.

Premise (2) is less controversial but is still question-begging against certain externalists.
Also, note that this may not exclude some theorists who call themselves externalists.
E.g. this does not rule out Korsgaard who thinks that all agents hvae internal Kantian reasons.
She states that pure practical reason exists if and only if we are capable of being motivated by its conclusions as such. 
This capacity, then, will be a disposition found in all agents.

### Sound Deliberation + Desire-Like Set

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation.
2. A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation only if A has a desire-like state that could motivate A to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A does not have a a disposition to X by believing R.
4. Therefore, there are no external reasons.

Premise (1) seems motivated and uncompelling.
E.g. It seems that an agent's moral and especially prudential reasons are not necessarily accessible from sound deliberation.
There might even be desire-based reasons that cannot be accessible from sound deliberation.
I.e. if there are desire-based reasons an agent has because of their inability to deliberate soundly.

Premise (2) is also uncompelling.
It states, believing R would motivate A post-deliberation only if A had some desire-like element in his pre-deliberation motivational set that would motivate him to X by believing R. 
Firstly, it assumes a neo-Humean theory of motivation, that all motivation derives from a desire-like state.
This is a dogma that is often assumed to be an a priori truth.
By all causal processes must be known empirically, and there is no empirical support for this thesis.
E.g. perhaps the introduction of the belief that R is sufficient to ground motivation.
Secondly, even if the neo-Humean theory of motivation is true, premise (2) still does not follow.
It doesn't follow that there needs to be some desire-like state *prior* to the deliberation.
It is possible that deliberation itself generates new, underived desires which were not present before.

### Sound Deliberation + Dispositional Set

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation.
2. A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation only if A has a disposition to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A does not have a a disposition to X by believing R.
4. Therefore, there are no external reasons.

Premise (1) seems unmotivated and uncompelling for the same reasons.

Premise (2) seems trivially true.
All the work is therefore done in (1), meaning this unmotivated/uncompelling premise begs the question against externalism.

## The Alternative Argument

This argument takes as its first premise a *conceptual* claim (not merely necessary/sufficient conditions) that: 

"R is a reason for A to X" *means* "R is an explanation of why A would be motivated to X if he deliberated soundly."

When agents act for normative reasons, those reasons are an explanation.
But not just any kind of explanation.
There can be explanatory reasons that are not normative, e.g. if they are based on false beliefs.
And there can be normative reasons that aren't explanatory, e.g. if the agent is not aware of them.
Thus, normative reasons are normativized kind of explanatory reasons.

### Objections

Even accepting that reasons statements are explanations under idealized conditions, one might question the conditions chosen here.

Why is analyzing reasons in terms of *these* idealizing conditions (rather than e.g. moral requirements) not question-begging?
Because Any rational deliberative agent has in his motivational set an interest in being factually/rationally correctly informed. 
More specifically, insofar as an agent deliberates, he can be assumed to value the conditions of sound deliberation.

Why is analyzing reasons in terms of conditions valued by the agent not question-begging?
Because there is a special role played by reasons statements that distinguish them from other normative statements.
Reasons statements play the role of influencing, motivating and guiding agents.
If we assume that "A has reason R to X" means "R explains why he would X under C", then this can only influence A if he actually values C as a condition for making decisions.
Becuase only these appeals can motivate agents, there are uniquely qualified to be explanations.

### Deliberation

*Some* aspects of deliberation involves reasoning towards an explanation of what one would do if one deliberated soundly.
Note that this is not all deliberation (otherwise, it would be vacuous). There is also instrumentalism, imagination, etc.
This model of deliberation has to take the form of evidence for the explanatory conclusion.
Thus, the motivational set comprises the starting material (or premises) for practical deliberation from which we try to explain what we would do if we deliberated soundly.

Note that an element in an agent's motivational set *cannot* ground any internal reasons if the element is inaccessible through deliberation (e.g. in the subconscious).
This is true despite the fact that such an element could *explain* why an agent has a certain motivation.
This shows how this argument differs from the motivational arguments.
An agent's reasons are restricted by his *epistemic access* to his motivational set.
This is because an agent's reasons are only considerations that can be explanatory of his actions *to him*.

### External Reasons

**Content**

The distinction between internal reasons and external reasons is not merely a connection to motives.
It is granted that external reasons can sometimes motivate.
The point is that external reasons are alleged to be conceptual independent of such a motive.
This allows that an agent *could* have a motive for acting on an external reason.

Williams argues that the *content* of an external reasons statement cannot be explanatory:

1. "R is a reason for A to X" means R is an explanation of why A would be motivated to X if he deliberated soundly.
2. External reasons statements *can* be true independently of an agent's motivations.
3. Nothing can explain an agent's actions under sound deliberation except his motivations.
4. Therefore, an external reason statement *by itself* could not explain one's motivations under sound deliberation.

**Beliefs**

Perhaps it's not the content, but rather a psychological relation to an external reasons statement that can explain action.
E.g. perhaps one's belief that an external reasons statement applies to them is what explains their acting.
The question is then what A comes to believe when he accepts a specific reasons claim.
In order for R to be a reason for A to X, R has to be recognizable *as a reason* to A through deliberation.
External reasons need to explain a special connection between acquiring a motivation and coming to believe a reason statement.
The following two conditions must be met:
(1) The agent acquires the new motivation *because* he comes to believe the reasons statement (otherwise R is not the explanation), and 
(2) This is because the agent is deliberating soundly, i.e. that it is *true* that R is a reason.

Thus, it follows that if A has an external reason to X, then this means (or entails) that: 
If the agent rationally deliberated, then, whatever motivations he originally had, he would become motivated to X.
Therefore, when an agent comes to be motivated by his true belief in an external reasons statement, the agent must *correctly* come to believe that R is an explanation to him, independent of his motivational set, of why he would be motivated to X if he deliberated soundly.
However, if an agent cannot discern in his psychology even a disposition to be motivated to X by R, then one cannot properly infer that R is an explanation for why he would X if he deliberated soundly. 

"By their conceptual independence from the agent’s desires and dispositions, external reasons statements thus exclude something essential for any evidence that the agent would be motivated through sound deliberation to φ. Therefore there can be no evidence that would enable A to draw the sound inference that R would, independently of his motivational set, explain his being motivated to φ if he deliberated soundly, since “if [the external reason statement] was true at all, it was true when [A] was not motivated” (p. 107). It follows that although external reasons *beliefs* might be able to motivate, there still cannot be any external reasons, because the condition that this belief must be true and warranted cannot possibly be met."

The argument against external reasons statements being explanatory by virtue of beliefs is as follows:

1. "R is a reason for A to X" means R is an explanation of why A would be motivated to X if he deliberated soundly.
2. If the explanation is simply A's belief B that R is a reason to X, then this requires (a) the motivation occur *because* of this belief, and (c) this belief must be true.
3. For external reason statements, this requires that A come to a correct conclusion that R would be an explanation of A's actions under sound deliberation, independently of considering his motivations.
4. Nothing can explain an agent's actions under sound deliberation except his motivations.
5. Therefore, beliefs in external reason statements cannot explain one's motivationa under sound deliberation.

Because neither external reason statements nor external reason beliefs can explain an agent's motivations under sound deliberation, there can be no true external reasons.

## Conclusion

It might be objected that the conceptual premise of the alternative argument is unsupported and question-begging.
It is unsupported. Williams seems to assume that it is an a priori truth without argument.
But it is not question-begging.
External reasons theorists agree that external reasons can motivate and explain action.
Williams addresses those theorists who mistakenly think the conceptual link from reasons to explanation is consistent with the existence of external reasons in virtue of being motivated by external reasons beliefs.

Still the conceptual premise is unargued for.
Even if we accept the connection between reasons and explanation, it doesn't follow that normative reason has to explain an agent's acting.
It could be an explanation of why one ought to an in a certain way.
The correct analysis of "a reason for action" remains a matter of controversy.
