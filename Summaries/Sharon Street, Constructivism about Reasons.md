## Introduction

There is no value independently of our valuing. Things are ultimately valuable because we take them to be. While there are no normative truths that hold independently of our normative attitudes (against realism), we can still go wrong about our normative judgments. Our reasons are ultimately a function of the reasons that we take ourselves to have. Any mistakes we make about reasons will be made on our own terms, not some attitude-independent standard.

Constructivist views in ethics understand the correctness or incorrectness of some (specified) set of normative judgments as constituted by whether those judgments withstand some (specified) procedure of scrutiny from the standpoint of some (specified) set of further normative judgments. Importantly, the correctness is *constituted* by the constructivist procedure, not merely *indicated*, *discovered* or *coincident* with the constructivist procedure (for, if the latter were true, there could be a constructivist procedure that was coincident with any ethical theory). It is not that there is truth out there independently that the constructivist procedure discovers; rather, being the upshot of the constructivist position just is what it is for a normative judgment to be correct.

There are three components of any constructivist view:
1. Target set of normative judgments: the set of normative judgments to which the account of correctness is meant to apply. The reasons that are the subject matter of these normative judgments are the *results* of construction.
2. Procedure of construction: the procedure of reflective scrutiny that is involved.
3. Grounding set of normative judgments: the set of normative judgments from the standpoint of which the procedure of reflection is undertaken. The reasons that are the subject matter of these normative judgments are the *materials* of construction.

*Restricted* constructivism makes these claims about the nature of correctness to some specific, restricted subset of normative judgments. *Metathical* constructivism makes these claims about the nature of correctness to all normative judgments.

## Restricted Constructivism

Restricted Constructivism state that the truth of a claim within a certain restricted set of normative claims (e.g. social justice, moral rightness/wrongness, etc.) consists in being entailed from within a substantively characterized practical point of view. An account of the truth is some limited subset of normative claims is reduced to what is entailed from a further set of substantive normative claim, which are taken for granted. 

*Rawl's Conception of Justice*: 
* Target set of normative judgments: judgments about social and political justice in a liberal democratic society.
* Results of construction: Rawl's two principles of political justice. 
* Procedure of construction: Original Position - rational agents, conceived of as representatives of a liberal democratic society and subject to what Rawls calls "reasonable conditions", select principles of justice to regulate the basic structure of society.
* Materials of construction: Two normative conceptions: (1) the conceptions of persons as free and equal, and (2) the conception of society as a fair system of cooperation over time. These normative conceptions are taken to be implicit in the public political culture of a liberal democratic society.
* Grounding set of normative judgments: our judgments endorsing the two normative conceptions of the materials of construction.

The standard of correctness in question is a standard of *reasonableness* rather than a standard of *truth*.
