# Well-being

## Overview

## Introduction

The previous chapter argued for a pluralistic value that doesn't reduce compeltely to teleology.
One might respond that things are valuable only insofar as they contribute to well-being, where well-being is teleological.
This chapter argues that such a response is mistaken by completing the argument of the previous chapter.

It is supposed that a single notion of individual well-being plays the following three roles:

1. It serves as a basis for what a single rational individual has reason to want (ignoring e.g. moral duties).
2. It is what a concerned benefactor has reason to promote for others.
3. It is the basis on which an individual's interests are taken into account in moral argument.

The first role is supposed to be primary; well-being plays the latter two roles *because* of its first role.
It is supposed to be independent of morality.

Well-being is commonly assumed to admit of quantitative comparisons of the following kinds:

* The levels of well-being enjoyed by different individuals.
* The increments in a single individual's well-being that result from various chanegs.
* The levels of well-being represented by different lives.

Many of these suppositions are mistaken.
There is not a single notion of well-being that plays these three roles.
We have an intuitive idea of well-being and can make rough comparisons about that makes a life better/worse from the persective of the person's life.
But individuals have little need for a theory to clarify the boundaries of their own well-being to provide quantitative comparisons.

From a third-person perspective, i.e. a benefactor or morality, we may need to appeal to well-being.
We might need this to make comparisons of how well-off people would be under various conditions.
But the moral conception of well-being used is not the same as the notions of well-being that individuals use to assess their own lives.
E.g. political philosophy concerns comparative standards shaped by the responsibility of basic social institutions.
Well-being used in moral argument concerns conceptions of well-being shaped by ideas of what we owe to each other.
Both of these criteria are incomplete measures of well and individual's life could go.

## Questions of Well-Being

To identify the question of well-being of concern, it shall be distinguished from four other ideas of "quality of life":

1. Quality of a life in terms of material and social conditions.
2. Experiential quality of a life. 
3. Value of a life. Degree to which it is admirable or worthy of respect.
4. Choiceworthiness of a life. 
	The question of whether a person should prefer a certain life of others, e.g. a life of lower well-being that benefits others.
	Each of the earlier 3 factors and the kind of well-being discussd here is a factor that bears on the choiceworthiness of a life.

The idea of well-being of concern here is a quality of life broader than material/social conditions. 
It is also potentially different than experiential quality; it certain isn't definitionally identical to experiential quality.
It is different from worthiness and value.
It is narrower than choiceworthiness all things considered.

## Accounts of Well-Being

Accounts of well-being are commonly divided into three types:

1. Experiential theories. Quality of life is determined by the experiential quality.
2. Desire theories. Quality of life is determined by the satisfaction of an agent's desires.
3. Substantive Good or Objective List theories. The denial of Desire theories (experiential theories are a special case of this).

While experiential theories provide clarity, they seem implausibly narrow;
e.g. the difference between true and false friends affects quality of life.
A desire theory can accomodate this problem, but the most general desire theories (unrestricted actual-desires) seems too broad.
e.g. someone might have a desire about the chemical composition of a star, about whether Julius Caesar was honest, etc.
But it's strange to say that any of these facts can affect a person's well-being.
Another issue is that (as shown in Chapter 1) desires never provide reasons for action.
Thus, it's odd to see how something can contribute to one's well-being without providing reasons for pursuing it.

### Informed and Rational Desires

These objections to desire theories may be partially met by shifting to an "informed desire" theory.
But the objection still cannot be met.
These theories usually understand informed desires as counterfactual desires to avoid appealing to a person's reasons for certain desires.
But when this happen, well-being will lack any connection to reasons for desire/intention again.
Even if we instead identify "informed desire" with "*rational* desire" (normatively understood), there's still a problem.
It seems that there can be times where the objects of a rational desire does not promote one's well-being or quality of life. 
e.g. a person's rational desire might be that a certain admired person is loved by her peers.
But assuming one never finds out about the truth of this matter, this cannot make the person's life better or worse.

Even when a person's rational desires does line up with their well-being, the relation doesn't seem to be causal.
Imagine a person has a rational desire D for X because of considerations C.
X doesn't contribute to well-being because because of the desire D; rather, it's because of the considerations C.
E.g. a person might have a rational desire to learn French because of the enjoyment he would get and how it would change his life.
But it's not the *desire* that improves well-being; it's the enjoyment and the change of life.
Also, it's not the desire that provides the reason for the desire; it's the enjoyment and change of life.  

There are 2 interpretations of "desire" than can explain the wide-appeal of desire fulfillment as the basis of well-being.
One interpretation understands "desires" as "preferences" in formal theories of individual and social choice.
These state that the preferences of rational agents satisfy certain axioms meaning they can be represented by mathematical utility functions.
It might seem that a person's utility, as defined by such a function, should be taken as a measure of well-being.
The problem is that these theories typically do not understand "well-being" as is discussed here.
These are instead concerned with what it is most rational for an individual to choose.
Preferences are expressions of an individual's conclusions about the relative desirability of various outcomes/policies.
This does not imply that preferences are the starting points of deliberation, or that they constitute well-being.

### Rational Aims

Another appeal to desire satisfaction as the basis of well-being is identifying "desire" with a person's rational aims.
Aims here are understood as a person's plans or projects (reflected decisions about reasons) as opposed to desires (seemings of reasons).
These aims aare also viewed from a purely personal perspective.
Both the idea of informed desires and rational aims are open to broader and norrower interpretations.
Broad: the aims and desires that a person would have good reason to have.
Narrow: the aims that a person actually has, insofar as the nature of the aims does not provide good reason to revise/abandom them.
The problem with the broad interpretation is again that aims themselves play no role in one's well-being (it's the considerations themselves).
However, the narrow interpretation can indicate the importance of an agent actually having a certain aim.

One cannot respond pursue every end that is worthwhile; thus, a central part of life lies in selecting the ands to pursue.
Therefore, if an agent endorses an end, then success in achieving it becomes something that makes a person's life better.
The "rational" component of "rational" aim still allows for one's current aims to be criticized.
Note that the criticism must be from the agent's personal perspective (not necessarily from a third-party).
Note that "aim" or "end" is understood broader than teology, e.g. one can have an end to live up to a non-teological value.
E.g. one can adopt as an end to be a good friend, but this need not be understood as a goal to promote some state of affairs.

The shift from "informed desire" to "rational aims" provides a plausible responses to several objections to desire theories.
(1) The range of a person's informed/rational desires is much wider than well-being.
But this might not be true for an agent's rational aims, where aim is taken as a longterm, comprehensive plan for one's life.
In that case, satisfaction of the aim seems like it *would* contribute to their well-being.
(2) Desire theories suggest that a person's overall well-being is measured by the sum of his/her desires.
It doesn't seem that one's well-being is always increased with the number of desires/aims that are fulfilled.
If this were true, everyone should be advised to adopt as many desires/aims as possible as long as they can be satisfied, which is absurd.
Focusing on "rational" aims avoids this because we only focus on aims that it is "rational" to have.
Also, aims (unlike desires) allows us a hierarchical structure of goals, aims and ends.
This allows priority to be given to more important, comprehensive ends, goals or aims.
Unlike desires, where priority must be based purely on "strength". 

### General Theory

Success in one's rational aims therefore can plausibly contribute to well-being, but it is not only well-being.
One's experiential state, suffering, pain and pleasure, can also influence well-being.
It is an open-question whether any other factors can contribute to well-being.
It might be argued that these are the only factors because well-being must affect how things go *for that person*.
These provide the basis for rough judgments of cmoparitive well-being, i.e. well-being is increased if one of these increases without decreasing the other.
But this does not amount to a *theory* of well-being.

A theory might provide:

1. a more unified account of well-being, 
2. a clearer boundary between what contributes to one's well-being, and what one has reason to pursue for other reasons.
3. a standard for making more exact comparisons of well-being.
Such a theory seems unlikely, e.g. it seems unlikely to have a general theory about the weight to give to experiences versus success in rational aims.
Such a theory would have to provide a more general theory of what is valuable, and worth pursuing, which seems unlikely.
Regardless, from a first-person perspective, such a general theory does not matter much.
We do not need answers to many of the questions that it would answer

## The Importance of Well-Being: First-Person Perspectives

There are two ways that the concept of well-being might be important. Either
(1) Its role in explaining the importance of the things that contribute to well-being.
(2) The difference it makes whether something contributes to well-being.
Either kind of thinking is only important when discussed from a third-person perspective, e.g. from a benefactor or moral perspective.
Neither are important from a first-person perspective.

Well-being is an "inclusive good" in that it is composed of other things that are inherently good; it's not "made good" by their contributions.
E.g. we have reason to seek enjoyment, avoid pain, and promote our aims in life, but well-being provides no *explanation* for why these are valuable.
It makes sense to say that I am doing X because X is enjoyable or satisfies an aim.
But it doesn't make sense to say that I should value enjoyment or satisfactions of aims because it makes my life better.

One context that it might be said that well-being is important is in everyday decisions about particular actions. 
It might be thought that well-being constitutes a distinct "sphere of compensation", thus it provides a significant category of goods.
Losses in well-being of one kind could be fully compensated by other gains in well-being, but not other kinds of considerations.
This is mistaken; a sacrifice in pleasure no for the sake of others is the same as a sacrifice in pleasure now for pleasure in the future.
In both cases there is an uncompensated loss, regardless of whether the "gain" is in terms of well-being or not.
One might say that a fully rational agent would lose well-being now for future well-being, but not for non-well-being reasons.
But there is no reason to assume that this is true in one case but not the other.
The notion of overall well-being dooes not guide our decision-making from a personal perspective.
When we assess the pros and cons of an action, we include all relevant reasons for and against the action, including non-well-being reasons.
There is no independent sphere where we only consider benefits and costs just in terms of well-being and then consider other reasons.

It might be objected that well-being marks a category of considerations that it would be irrational to ignore.
But this relies on a misuse of "irrationality" as mentioned in Chapter 1. 
Insofar as one judges themselves to have reason to promote their well-being, ignoring their well-being would be irrational.
But it would be irrational only because they failed to act on considerations that they judged to be reasons.
Had they not judged their well-being to be valuable, it would not be irrational to ignore it.

Another context where the importance of well-being might be posited is in one's main aims of life.
It might be objected that the focus has been on using well-being to evaluate decisions about particular, everyday actions.
Instead, well-being might be used to assess decisions about a perosn's longterm, comprehensive plans for life.
However, even a maximally comprehensive goal of "how to live" is not necessary a conception of well-being.
The reasons for a comprehensive life goal sometimes do not include reasons grounded in well-being.
From a personal perspective, a person might purposefully select a goal with lower well-being if it promotes some other reasons the agent has.
Questions about the worthiness of longterm plans are questions about the *choiceworthiness* of a life, which is broader than well-being.

It might be objected that well-being is at least an important factor in choices about one's life goals, even if not the only factor.
It is true that enjoyments, avoiding pain, etc. are important considerations in decisions about life goals.
But it is questionable that well-being is important, because well-being in this context is abstract and indeterminate.
Succes in one's main aims are an important element in well-being, but at this stage we are deciding *which* main aims to select.
Well-being becomes somewhat determinate only after our main aims have been selected. 

There are two distortions that are caused by focusing on well-being.

1. Since well-being is a state to be "brought about".
	Thus, focus on well-being suggests that values are to be represented in terms of reasons to *promote* certain results.
	But, as argued in Chapter 2, one can be commited to values that are not teleological.
	Acting as one's values require is not the same as maximizing the degree to which one's actions conform to those values.
2. It seems to transform all of a person's aims into self-interested ones.
	When we say something contributes to one's well-being, it suggests things that benefit him.
	But from an individual's perspective, many of the things that contribute to his well-being are valued for other reasons.

## The Importance of Well-Being: Third-Person Perspectives

Note some of the reasons we have for doing certain things that promote well-being. We might have reason to X if:
(1) doing X will benefit oneself, e.g. relieve pain
(2) X has some special relation to oneself, e.g. reasons to promote the pleasure of one's friends, family, etc. (regardless of personal benefit)
(3) X has some other feature that we value, e.g. if one values preventing Venice from collapsing.

From a benefactor's perspective, benefiting the recipient has a special significance.
In the first class of reasons (1), the benefactor's reasons are the same as the reasons from the perspective of the recipient.
I.e. the reason that the benefactor has to benefit A is because it will e.g. relieve pain, suffering, etc.
In the 2nd class of reasons (2), they differ: the benefactor does these things *because* they benefit the recipient.

There are two points to be drawn:
(1) Divergence in reasons betewen first-person and third-person outlooks
(2) It is not clear how important the boundaries of well-being are even from a benefactor's perspective.
It seems a benefactor might have reason to do what we have reason to do, as opposed to what will promote our well-being.
E.g. if A has good reason to X even though X leads to less well-being, it seems a benefactor has reason to help A to X.

## The Importance of Well-Being: Moral Perspectives

It has been shown that well-being does not play an important role in the decisions of a single rational individual (from his perspective).
Given this, the question is we think that well-being plays such a central role in individual decisions or moral argument?
One explanation could be hedonistic theories that stated that an individual's reason and our moral reasons reduced to pleasure.

It might be thought that well-being is important to moral theory in three ways:

1. Well-being might figure in the content of moral requirement. 
	E.g. maximize well-being, or never harm someone's well-being.
2. Well-being might justify moral principles even when it doesn't figure in their content.
	E.g. Rules to respect a certain right might be grounded in the promotion of well-being caused by its general observence/acceptance.
3. Well-being might justify morality as a whole.
	E.g. in response to questions like "Why be moral"?

The first and second requires quantitative comparisons.
The second and third requires something rational for agents without presupposing a value of morality.
Well-being might seem to satisfy these requirements.
The three roles that well-being is supposed to play in moral theory are mistaken.

First, the question of whether well-being must figure in the content of moral requirements.
There are some moral principles that involve overall assessment of how well-off individuals are.
But these are usually either broader than notions of well-being or more narrow.
They might be broader in utility functions underlying social choice theories.
And they might be more narrow in e.g. Rawls's primary social goods.
These notions are shaped by moral ideas arising from the particular moral questions that they attempt to answer.
E.g. Well-being in terms of Rawls's primary social goods is based on individual situations that are the responsibility of social institutions.
There could be more principles whose content involves the intuitive idea of well-being.
E.g. promote the well-being of others insofar as we can do so without great sacrifice, avoid harm, relieve distress, etc.
But this does not seem to derive from a gneral duty to promote well-being.

Second, the question of whether well-being plays a role in justifying the principles.
It is true that assessing the justifiability of moral principles involves what individuals have reason to want, and many are concerned with well-being. 
However, as will be argued in Chapter 5, not all the reasons for rejecting principles of this form.
Further, the content of one's well-being is indeterminate given that we may not know one's main aims.
There are two ways of construing moral principles to deal with this indeterminacy:
(1) require the promotion of well-being of particular individuals once their well-being is determinate and known.
(2) require providing specific forms of opportunity, assistance and forbearance that we all have reasons to want.
Deciding between these two strategies involves a substantive moral choice.
Thus, well-being alone cannot serve as a starting point for justification that is without moral presuppositions.

Third, the question about the motivational basis for being moral.
Well-being might constitute one reason to be moral.
Another reason might be to appeal to other things we have reason to value. 
This will be argued later.

## Conclusion: Well-Being Not a Master Value

One might still say that well-being is a master value, i.e. other things are valuable only insofar as they contribute to individual well-being.
The problem is that this assumes that well-being is a good seperate from other values.
But well-being is best understood as an "inclusive good", that is simply a composition of other values.
Nor is well-being what explains why these other values are actually valuable.
