## Introduction

Libertarianism is typically understood as a theory of justice based on the allocation of two "basic" sets of robust individual rights:

1. Ownership rights, both over the self and external resources, constitute the first and most basic set of libertarian rights. 
2. Enforcement rights constitute the second set. Their aim is to prevent and
rectify violations to individuals’ ownership rights. 

The purpose of this article is to explore a third possible set of rights: exception rights

Like basic rights, exception rights are enforceable moral prerogatives. Exception rights, however, are only supposed to arise under certain types of extraordinary circumstance. Exception rights allow their holders to infringe on others’ basic rights in extraordinary circumstances - when the infringements in question are both: 
1. necessary for the alleged exception-right holders to overcome a perilous situation for which they are not responsible, and 
2. not unreasonably costly to others.

Justification for the recognition of exception rights:
1. Exception rights are necessary for avoiding two weakness of libertarianism: its distribution insensitivity and its consequence insensitivity. 
2. The recognition of exception rights is grounded on the same commitment to individual sovereignty that is behind basic libertarian rights. They are not an ad hoc moderation on the fundamental libertarian commitment to individual sovereignty. Rather, they are a different nomological articulation of that same commitment.

Eric Mack (2015) has provided a similar line of argument in regards to the permissibility of what we would take as trivial rights violations. If libertarian rights were to be regarded as blocking trivial intrusions which were necessary for significant benefits for everybody else, libertarian rights would fail to secure the benefits that they are meant to promote. Similar reasoning applies to certain extraordinary circumstances that are not properly characterized as involving trivial rights violations.

## From Moral Anarchy to Libertarian Rights

Imagine "moral anarchy" - a situation where individuals do not observe any sort of moral constraint on their self-interested behavior. This could result in a state of affairs in which a great number of individuals are powerless to arrange their lives in the way they want because individuals under moral anarchy might constantly interfere with one another in their corresponding pursuits. Moral theories specify the conditions under which individuals must constrain their self-interested pursuit of goals. 

Classical forms of utilitarianism would state that it makes more sense for everybody to adopt the same overall goal - the maximization of total happiness, or adopt whatever goal has the maximization of total happiness as a consequence. But this fails to address an aspect of the conflict of moral anarchy that is particularly worrisome. The problem is that the all-consuming conflict we might expect in moral anarchy is replaced by the all-consuming demands of the greatest happiness - instead of individuals being used as resources for the satisfaction of the desires of those who are stronger, they are used as resources for the satisfaction of the desires of whoever are those who happen to bring more happiness into the world. Either way, factors that are ultimately beyond individuals’ control would determine whether they would be able to lead their own lives. 

Libertarianism and rights theories generally are best understand as responses to this intuitive failure of classical utilitarianism. In contrast to classical versions of utilitarianism, rights theories do not propose to escape from moral anarchy by means of providing a unique goal that all must serve either directly or indirectly. Instead, they allocate control to each individual over a specific set or range of actions. These allocations of control allow the individual to perform or refrain from performing the corresponding actions, and they impose on others the obligations not to interfere. 

Within libertarian theory, individuals’ most basic areas of moral freedom are generally specified in terms of ownership rights - i.e. the material objects that those individuals are entitled to control. Everyone agrees that basic self-ownership - i.e. the use and control of our own body - is a necessary condition for our agency. It is also clear that the ability to live one's own life also requires *some* form of control over external objects. E.g. under a robust scheme of joint ownership of external resources, each individual would be assigned a claim right against every other, against the use and possessions of those resources. Thus, no individual would have the liberty to use or possess such resources without the approval of everybody else. This doesn't allow for individual sovereignty, since whether individuals are capable of leading their own lives will depend on factors that are ultimately beyond their control. Libertarians thus tend to support have unilateral access and control over external resources, subject to a Lockean proviso that "enough and as good" is left for others.

If there are reasons why individuals should have the freedom afforded by ownership rights, then there are also reasons individuals should have the freedom assigned by enforcement rights. Some of these rights include the rights to (1) retaliatory threats, (2) self-defense, (3) restitution, and perhaps (4) the right to punish. 

## Insensitivities of Libertarianism

The most fundamental criticisms of libertarianism are related to two forms of insensitivity: distribution insensitivity and consequence insensitivity. Both arise from libertarianism’s emphasis on voluntary agreement as the exclusive mechanism to alter the set of enforceable obligations that arise from the original allocation of basic rights.

1. Distribution insensitivity - we could conceive that the respect of a system of libertarian rights could, under the specification of certain contingent facts, lead to a situation of dreadful misery for a great proportion of individuals.
2. Consequence insensitivty - non-voluntary coercion (e.g. from a state) seems necessary for the provision of the justice and security. Thus, libertarians sometimes oppose the state because the state will coerce individuals to stay away from performing actions that would seem to be included in the areas of freedoms protected by individuals’ ownership and enforcement rights.

The problem with this assessment of the illegitimacy of the state is its isconnection from any consideration regarding the state of affairs that we would expect to be materialized in a stateless society; it would matter neither how serious such problematic features are, nor how easily the state would be able to rectify them. A plausible political philosophy would seem to demand the recognition of the *potential* legitimacy of coercive government action oriented to remedying either serious distributional or consequentialist concerns. The challenge is to offer such an account that is compatible with the rationale for those individuals’ basic libertarian rights that are infringed upon by that coercion.

## The case for exception rights

Within libertarian theory, a basic reason why a system of individual ownership rights is preferred over a system of joint ownership of external resources is that the latter leaves individuals at the mercy of others’ wills. Also, the need for a Lockean proviso arises from a similar concern. Joint ownership or unilateral ownership without a proviso is morally equilvalent to moral anarchy.

By no fault of their own, individuals might face situations in which, despite having exclusive control over their own body and over a certain portion of external resources, they would need the approval of others regarding the performance of certain actions that would be necessary for securing the benefit that such rights typically provide. In these situations, individuals’ ownership rights would lose their worth in the same way in which a right of self-ownership loses its worth under joint ownership of external resources. Thus, while individuals’ basic rights are necessary for the protection of individuals’ capacity to lead their own lives, in certain situations, those rights themselves might restrict that very same capacity in other individuals without providing a significant benefit to anybody else. Exception rights block this possibility.

The conditions under which individuals acquire exception rights must include: 
1. Serious peril faced by the alleged exception-right holder. Perhaps when an individual is below a utility or well-being threshold, or some other specification of how they are prevented from acquiring benefits meant to be provided by libertarianism.
2. The fact that such a perilous situation is not the fault of the alleged right bearer (in the sense of not being due to a neglected reasonable
opportunity for avoiding the situation). There are at least two reasons for this: (a) basic claims about desert, and (b) internalizing the costs of personal decisions to not incentivize recklessness.
3. The necessary character of the corresponding infringement to overcome the peril. This implies (a) that the peril in question must be of a remediable nature, and (b) that exception rights emerge only when voluntary solutions are unavailable, and (c) the cost imposed on others must be minimized.
4. The reasonable cost of compliance imposed on others. 

Compensation by the holder of the exception right might be due to the individual whose basic ownership rights have been infringed upon. However, this is a mere corollary of the requirement to minimize the costs that could be permissibly imposed onto others (see 3), i.e. if we cannot afford compensation, the coercion may still be justified if the cost is still reasonable.

As a matter of principle, the recognition of exception rights allows for the establishment of a safety net, or perhaps of even more extensive redistributive programs in order to deal with distributive concerns of the most serious type. However, this is not necessarily true for all such programs, or even the state as a whole. It may be that there are non-coercive methods for alleviating serious peril (e.g. charity) or that welfare programs modify incentives in such a way to make consequences worse. So whether exception rights lead to any government programs is contingent on the validity of certain empirical claims. It is a clear virtue of an exception-rights approach that moves such empirical claims to the center of the discussion.

Although it might not be necessary to infringe upon the rights of everybody to provide such benefits, there might be reasons of fairness to do so.
