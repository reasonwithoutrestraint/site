## Introduction

In this chapter, I address questions about whether core rights affirmed by Nozick are considerably more deeply restrictive than Nozick himself anticipates. I address questions about whether those rights are so constraining that they deeply restrict their own exercise. These questions have been forcefully pressed in two important critical discussions of rights-oriented libertarian thought, Peter Railton’s “Locke, Stock, and Peril: Natural Property Rights, Pollution, and Risk” (1985) and David Sobel’s “Backing Away from Libertarian Self- Ownership” (2012).

Both of these papers maintain that “libertarian rights” or “Lockean rights” are much more restrictive than their advocates generally recognize. Libertarian rights demand that all agents desist from even the most minor unprovoked and non-consensual physical intrusions upon right-holders; in addition, these rights demand that all agents desist from imposing on others even modest risks of such intrusions. Yet, compliance with these demands requires that individuals forego almost all of the ordinary exercises of rights by which individuals maintain their lives and achieve their ends. Such stringent libertarian rights morally hog-tie their possessors. These rights systematically make their exercise morally impermissible. The complaint is that much of whatever is within one’s domain - in the sense that others may not destroy or seize or control it without one’s permission - will not be within one’s sovereign domain - in the sense that one’s chosen use of that material is morally allowed and protected.

In this chapter, I focus on what the friend of libertarian rights should say about “minor intrusions,” i.e., impositions of very low-level physical effects upon another person or her property. I take it that any sensible friend of libertarian rights will want to say that minor intrusions are morally permissible. The difficulty is to provide an explanation for this permissibility that does not render rights less morally imposing or less contra-consequentialist than libertarian rights theorists want them to be.

Railton and Sobel maintain that a natural solution involves a general shift from an understanding of claim-rights as moral claims that are protected by property rules to an understanding of claim-rights as moral claims that are protected by liability rules. If a moral boundary is protected by a property rule, others are required not to cross that boundary without the consent of the right-holder. On the other hand, if a boundary is protected by a liability rule, others may cross that boundary without the consent of the right-holder as long as due compensation is paid.

I agree that a general liability rule attenuation of rights explains the permissibility of minor intrusions in a way that undermines the robustness of the rights that the libertarian theorist endorses. Hence, the need for the friend of libertarian rights to offer an alternative explanation for the permissibility of minor intrusions. I offer an alternative “elbow room for rights” explanation for the permissibility of minor intrusions: a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect. The elbow room postulate tells us that, since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, a reasonable delineation of rights does not construe minor intrusions as boundary-crossings. Since minor intrusions are not to count as boundary-crossings, no liability rule attenuation of rights is needed to render those actions permissible.

The moral elbow room postulate is not an ad hoc stipulation dreamed up solely to deal with the difficulties that Railton and Sobel explore. Rather, the postulate is well anchored in the underlying reasons for affirming Lockean rights. Moreover, the postulate can deal with a range of over-restrictiveness issues that are not considered by Railton or Sobel.

The most basic organizing principle for Lockean rights theory is the moral principle that each individual is to be allowed to live his own life in his own chosen way. Lockean rights theory needs both to provide philosophical support for this organizing principle and to articulate it in terms of the ascription to persons of an array of abstract moral rights. Each abstract moral right provides individuals with moral protection against one of the diverse ways in which they can be prevented (by others) from living their own lives in their own chosen ways. For these reasons, the right to self-ownership and he right to acquire and exercise discretional control over extra-personal objects are important aspects of the proper delineation of libertarian rights. However, agents who are not enabled to live as they choose because another party declines to supply one of his kidneys or declines to participate in desired sexual interactions are not thereby made unable—or precluded from living their own lives in their own chosen ways.

## Assessing liability rule attenuation

I focus on how unattractive general liability rule attenuation is for the Lockean theorist and, hence, how eager that theorist should be to find a different explanation of the permissibility of minor intrusions.

## Epstein on implicit in-kind compensation

I explore the explanation for the permissibility of minor intrusions advocated by the Locke-leaning legal theorist Richard Epstein. Epstein’s scheme allows minor intrusions on individuals on the basis of those individuals being implicitly compensated in-kind by being allowed themselves to engage in minor intrusions on others.

## Bramwell and the live-and-left-live rule

Here I focus on Baron Bramwell’s invocation in Bamford v. Turnley (Bamford 1862) of a live-and-let-live maxim in support of the permissibility of minor intrusions. I examine Bramwell’s stance in section 4 and contend that it is at least as readily interpreted as an elbow room argument as an implicit in-kind compensation argument. Bramwell also maintains that minor intrusions—what he calls “annoyances”—that are wanton or malicious may be enjoined even though those minor intrusions are to be allowed if they are performed non-wantonly and non-maliciously.

## Wanton and Malicious intrusions

I sketch how implicit in-kind compensation reasoning and elbow room reasoning can underwrite the distinction between non-wanton/non-malicious and wanton/malicious intrusions. This distinction enables the Lockean rights advocate to hold—as Nozick held (1974,p. 75)—that stealing a penny is impermissible without also holding that
incidentally causing a penny’s worth of damage to another’s property is a boundary-crossing.

## Elbow Room Reasoning

I expand on my claims that elbow room delineation of rights is well rooted within Lockean natural rights theory
and I explain why elbow room reasoning is not, contrary to appearances.

In order for people to possess the moral liberty to do as they see fit with their persons and property, they must have claim-rights (to supplement their liberty-rights) over themselves and their property. These claim-rights require others to leave them in discretionary control of themselves and their rightful holdings.

At the same time, the lesson to be drawn from the hog-tying challenge is that, in order for people to possess the moral liberty to do as they see fit with their own persons and property, they must not be morally precluded from engaging in minor intrusions that are integral to their discretionary control over and disposition of their own persons and property.

The elbow room postulate plays a systematic role within rights theory by guiding the reasonable delineation of rights. Two examples:

1. Moral elbow room reasoning is used in (a) arguing against joint-onwership theory of property and (b) for the Lockean proviso that Locke provides: 
	a. If the earth were originally the joint property of all of mankind, any permissible individual use of any portion of the earth would require a compact among all the joint-owners that is impossible. But if the earth were the joint property of all, then there would be no room for individuals to exercise their most fundamental natural right, viz., “the right everyone had to take care of, and provide for their Subsistence” (Locke 1689, First Treatise, §87). For any exercise of this fundamental right requires that individuals be at liberty to make use of portions of the earth.
	b. Locke's argument against a delineation of private property rights that on net diminishes the opportunity of individuals “to take care of, and provide for their Subsistence” (1689, First Treatise, §87). This is why we have claim-rights that constrain the behavior of others such that their acquisition of private property on net leave "enough, and as good" (1689, Second Treatise, §27) for the use of that individual.

2. Moral elbow room reasoning is used to support the right of self-defense. Why is the use of harmful force against another agent morally permissible when it is employed in order to block that other agent from violating one’s rights? Why doesn’t the attacker’s right of self-ownership morally preclude the defender from striking the attacker in order to ward off the attack? One response goes from the prospective victim’s self-ownership to her possession of a moral liberty to defend herself against violations of that right, and from that moral liberty to harm-inflicting defensive acts not being boundary-crossings. This is possible only if agents do not have rights against being subject to such defensive acts.
	- The elbow room account avoids reliance upon the idea that the attacker forfeits in part or in whole an original blanket right against being subjected to any harmful force. This avoidance is a good thing if one holds—as one should—that self-defensive force may be used against blameless attackers. For forfeiture can do no real work in explaining the permissibility of those self-defensive acts.

## Abstract rights vs Concrete rules

I conclude with an observation or two about the relationship between armchair philosophical delineation of abstract rights and the assessment of actual concrete legal rights.
