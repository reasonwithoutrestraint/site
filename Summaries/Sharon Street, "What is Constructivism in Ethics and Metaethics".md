# What is Constructivism in Ethics and Metaethics

## Proceduralist vs Practical Standpoint Characterizations

One interpretation of constructivism in ethics is the *proceduralist characterization*: There are no moral facts independent of the finding that a certain hypothetical procedure would have a certain output. Normative truth is not merely discovered by or coinciding with the outcome of a certain procedure, but as constituted by emergence from the procedure. In other words, their truth is not independent of the procedure. Rawl's "veil of ignorance" is an example of such a constructivist view. 

The proceduralist characterization might be intelligible as a theory of substantive ethics. However, it has problems as a candidate for a unique metaethical position: (1) It is difficult to see how this *could be* a metaethical view. If two constructivist disagree about whether normative truth emerged from procedure A or B, then this seems like a substantive normative disagreement, compatible with many different metaethical interpretations. (2) It is difficult to see how this could be a *unique* metaethical view. For example, how could it differ from metaethical views that reduce normative facts to natural facts about the responses of agents in certain idealized circumstances.

The proceduralist characteriziation is not only dubious as a unique metaethical view, it also fails to capture what is most interesting and distinctive about constructivism. Now turn to the *practical standpoint characterization* of constructivism. What's centrally important is that constructivism reduces normative truth to what emerges from a *practical standpoint* - the point of view of an agent or set of agents who accept certain values (or who have any values, on a more ambitious minimalist account). The proceduralist characterization is useful only as a heuristic device for determining what follows from a certain practical standpoint.

On this characterization of constructivism, the main components of the metaethical theory is as follows: (1) Even if we don't understand what valuing *is*, we understand the attitude of valuing, the evaluative attitude of a creature who takes certain thing to be reasonable or unreasonable. A creature who holds any such evaluative attitude can be said to occupy *the practical point of view*. (2) We have an understanding of *entailment* from within the standpoint of any given set of values. With these two components, normative truth, then, consists in what is entailed from the practical point of view, i.e. what follows from the perspective of a creature who already values things.
