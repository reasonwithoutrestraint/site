# What is the Moral Problem

Consider the following two distinctive features of moral discourse:

1. The *practicality* of morality.
    - *Rationality* - judging that an act is morally right implies that one has reason to perform the act.
    - *Motivation* - judging that an act is morally right (because of the rationality of moral judgments) implies that one has some motivation to perform the act.
2. The *objectivity* of morality. 
    - *Correctness* - we suppose that moral judgments can be correct, which implies a domain of moral facts about which we can form (true or false) beliefs.
    - *Agent-Neutral* - no one is better placed to discover them than anyone else. The only relevant determinate for the rightness of an act is the *circumstances* that the action takes place, regardless of *who* finds themselves in those circumstances.
    - *Accessible* - by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover objective moral facts.

According to the standard picture of psychology (from Hume), there are two kinds of psychological states - beliefs and desires. Beliefs represent how the world is, and thus can be evaluated based on the accuracy of their representations. Desires represent how the world is to be, and thus cannot be evaluated on the basis of any accuracy of the world. According to Hume, these states of mind are conceptually distinct. Thus, it is always possible to pull them apart modally; for any belief-desire pair, we can conceive of someone with one state of mind and not the other. Because of this, desires are not in themselves subject to rational assessments; they are merely arrational dispositions that we have. Action is thus the product of these two states: an action X requires that someone have a desire P be true and a belief that action X will make it the case that P becomes true.

These two features plus the Humean psychology creates the following three claims:

1. Moral judgments express a belief about an objective fact.
2. If A judges that it is morally right X then he is motivated to X
3. An agent is motivated to X only if he has some appropriate desire.

(1) suggests that moral judgments express beliefs. (2) and (3) suggest that moral judgments express desires. But, according to the standard Humean picture, beliefs and desires are distinct experiences, so this cannot be possible. This creates the Moral Problem, which is the organizing problem explaining much disagreement in metaethics. Different metaethical positions reject different claims in this dilemma. The expressivists deny (1), the externalists deny (2) and the non-Humeans deny (3).

This books argues that we can accept (1) and (2) and much of the spirit of (3). The major sub-plot of the book concerns how much of the Humean theory of motivation can be rejected or accepted. The argument turns on a distinction between kinds of reasons: normative and motivating. We should accept Hume's claim that beliefs and desires are distinct experience that are essential to explaining the motivating reasons behind every human action. But we should reject his claims that desires are beyond rational criticism. This will be based on an anti-Humean theory of normative reasons. In essence, moral judgments express desires that an agent believes they would have if they were fully rational.
