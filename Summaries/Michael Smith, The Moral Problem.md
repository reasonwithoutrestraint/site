# What is the Moral Problem

Consider the following two distinctive features of moral discourse:
1. The *practicality* of morality.
    - *Rationality* - judging that an act is morally right implies that one has reason to perform the act.
    - *Motivation* - judging that an act is morally right (because of the rationality of moral judgments) implies that one has some motivation to perform the act.
2. The *objectivity* of morality. 
    - *Correctness* - we suppose that moral judgments can be correct, which implies a domain of moral facts about which we can form (true or false) beliefs.
    - *Agent-Neutral* - no one is better placed to discover them than anyone else. The only relevant determinate for the rightness of an act is the *circumstances* that the action takes place, regardless of *who* finds themselves in those circumstances.
    - *Accessible* - by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover objective moral facts.

According to the standard picture of psychology (from Hume), there are two kinds of psychological states - beliefs and desires. Beliefs represent how the world is, and thus can be evaluated based on the accuracy of their representations. Desires represent how the world is to be, and thus cannot be evaluated on the basis of any accuracy of the world. According to Hume, these states of mind are conceptually distinct. Thus, it is always possible to pull them apart modally; for any belief-desire pair, we can conceive of someone with one state of mind and not the other. Because of this, desires are not in themselves subject to rational assessments; they are merely arrational dispositions that we have. Action is thus the product of these two states: an action X requires that someone have a desire P be true and a belief that action X will make it the case that P becomes true.

These two features plus the Humean psychology creates the following three claims:

1. Moral judgments express a belief about an objective fact.
2. If A judges that it is morally right X then he is motivated to X
3. An agent is morivated to X only if he has some appropriate desire.

(1) suggests that moral judgments express beliefs. (2) and (3) suggest that moral judgments express desires. But, according to the standard Humean picture, beliefs and desires are distinct experiences, so this cannot be possible. This creates the Moral Problem, which is the organizing problem explaining much disagreement in metaethics. Different metaethical positions reject different claims in this dilemma. The expressivists deny (1), the externalists deny (2) and the non-Humeans deny (3).

This books argues that we can accept (1) and (2) and much of the spirit of (3). The major sub-plot of the book concerns how much of the Humean theory of motivation can be rejected or accepted. The argument turns on a distinction between kinds of reasons: normative and motivating. We should accept Hume's claim that beliefs and desires are distinct experience that are essential to explaining the motivating reasons behind every human action. But we should reject his claims that desires are beyond rational criticism. This will be based on an anti-Humean theory of normative reasons.

# The Expressivist Challenge

### Alleged Dilemma of Descriptivism

Expressivism denies (1) that moral judgments express beliefs, and (2) that moral judgments are capable of truth. Rather, moral judgments express a speaker's (dispositions to have) attitudes of approval and disapproval, which are incapable of being true or false. We will consider Ayer's argument for expressivism, which comes from considering the only two forms of descriptivism - naturalism and non-naturalism.

Naturalism defines ethical terms in the form of non-ethical terms, e.g. utilitarian theories define goodness in terms of pleasure, happiness, satisfaction, etc; subjectivist theories define goodness in terms of the approval of certain individuals or societies. However, such analysis cannot be correct because for any naturalistic property 'N', it is never *self-contradictory* to say that N is sometimes not good. But this is impossible if there were such a naturalistic property 'N' that 'good' could be defined in terms of. Thus, there is no such naturalistic property 'N' to define 'good', which means naturalism is false.

Non-naturalism maintains that ethical concepts are irreducible to empirical concepts. Such a theory must maintain that ethical concepts are controlled by an "intellectual intuitionism". But such a theory cannot be emprically verifiable. Clearly, certain things may seem intuitive to some people but not to others, and there is no verifiable method to choose whose intuitions to trust. Since non-naturalism mantains that ethical propositions are genuine synthetic propositions which are not empirically verifiable, non-naturalism must be false (since, according to Ayer, all meaningful synthetic propositions are empirically verifiable).

### Non-Naturalism

Ayer's objection to non-naturalism is problematic because it depends on the merits of a controverisal theory of meaning - logical positivism. But there are other problems with non-naturalism that Ayer never mentioned. Ayer's general criticism against non-naturalism was its barren epistemology, and this can be revealed independent of logical positivism, as Simon Blackburn pointed did. 

If we are to enrich our ontology with special entities (i.e. moral facts), we need to have some method of accessing such facts, but non-naturalism seems to have no adequate answer (independent of logical positivism). The only epistemic method for learning of moral facts seems to be some sort of intuitive faculty analogous to *causal perceptual awareness* (independent moral facts *cause* perceptions that product moral judgments). The problem is this cannot explain a plattitude of moral reasoning: the *supervenience* of the moral on the natural. Everyone agrees that the moral properties of an entity *supervenes* on that entity's natural properties. Moreover, everyone agrees that this is an *a priori* truth. Recognition of the supervience of the moral on the non-moral is a constraint on the proper use of moral concepts.

Intuition is incompatible with supervenience because it cannot explain how merely *perceiving* that a certain entity with natural properties N and moral properties M can explain the *a priori* truth that all entities with natural properties N also have moral properties M. One possible explanation might be to say that after witnessing the coinstantiation of N and M and one circumstance, we generalize to other cases. But this faces two problems. 

1. It doesn't explain why it's an *a priori* truth. Just because one has perceived properties N and M together in one circumstances does not *guarantee* that properties N and M are *always* coinstantiated. Instead, this would be an inductive argument yielding a *contingent* and *a posteriori* truth. 
2. Moral reasoning very often involves *imagined* or *described* situations, not *perceived* situations. We form moral judgments about these imagine situations via general standards. But how can we *perceive* the applicability of general standards? How can we *perceive* the timelessness and universality of these general standards? And how can they be guaranteed a priori? It seems that a causal perceptual explanation of moral judgments cannot explain the cases where we form judgments about an imagined situation that could not have *caused* any of our judgments.

### Metaphysical (Synthetic) Naturalism

One response to Ayer denies that naturalism is a metaphysical thesis rather than a definitional thesis. It is a claim about property identities, not a claim about definitional identities. Thus, it could be possible that moral property M and natural property N are identical, whereby this would be a non-analytic (synthetic), *a posteriori*, necessary identity.

A similar strategy can be done by identifying color properties with certain surface reflectance properties. This identity need not be definitional, and can be handled in the way we handle proper names. For example, we could say that the word "red" refers to the surface reflectance property of objects that is causally responsible for our usage of the word red. This would be identifying the *property* redness with some surface reflectance property, but it would not be to identifying the *concepts* of redness with any surface reflectance property (surely, our *concepts* of redness was prior to any concepts of surface reflectance properties regarding light wavelengths). The general strategy to give a property identity of X is to posit a reference fixing description of X, which allows us to learn *a posteriori* which property that picks out that description and therefore X.

This strategy fails because naturalists would have to choose a description to fix the reference of moral terms. However, they must do so in a way that moral terms do not have different content in different contexts. But this is impossible if, for example, moral terms are used to refer to the naturalistic feature of properties that are causally responsible for our usage of those moral terms. It's possible that two persons' (or two societies') uses of moral terms are caused by different naturalistic properties. In that case, when these two persons or societies use moral terms different (say, to criticize each other), then they wouldn't even be disagreeing (i.e. their assertions would not be incompatible), because their terms would have different referents.
