# Wise Choices, Apt Feelings

### Morality and Rationality

To call something rational is to endorse it in some way. A wide variety of human attributes can be judged rational or irrational - a person can *act* (ir)rationally, *believe* (ir)rationally or even *feel* (ir)rationally in certain circumstances. What it is rational to do need not perfectly match what it is moral to do. Moral judgments are to be understood in terms of judgments of *moral wrongness*, and judgments of moral wrongness are to be undertood in terms of *blameworthiness*. To say that an action is *blameworthy* is to say that an agent would be to blame for performing that action; to say that someone is to blame for performing an action is to say that it would be rational for (1) that person to *feel guilty* for performing the action and (2) others to *resent him* for performing the action. 

To say that an action is morally wrong is to say that it violates standards that we demand other agents use to rule out certain actions. These standards are such that an agent who violates those standards would be to blame if (1) the agent must have performed the action because he wasn't *motivated* to rule out the action (i.e. it wasn't an accident), and (2) there are no extenuating circumstances that render the agent not fully *responsible* (i.e. the agent isn't mentally deficient, the agent had other alternative possibilities that did not cause extreme misery).

### Norm-Expressivistic Analysis of Rationality

To *say* that something is rational is to *express* acceptance of a system of norms that, on balance, permit it. To *judge* that something is rational is to actually *accept* such a system of norms. A norm here is a possible rule or prescription expressible in the form of an imperative. To decide what is really rational is to decide what norms to accept ourselves. Going back to moral analysis, it follows that to say that someone is blameworthy is to accept a system of norms that prescribe guilt from the agent and resent from others.

### Competing Motivations

Accepting a norm is a kind of psychological state that we are far from understanding. Acceptance of a norm is motivating at least to a degree. However, this is not the only kind of motivation. The motivation involved accepting a norm, *normative motivation*, can often conflict with, and be overpowered by, motivations that do not involve accepting a norm (e.g. weakness of will). This suggests that there are two competing psychological faculties. The psychological faculty involved in normative motivation is the *normative control system*, found only in relatively intelligent and sentient creatures. The psychological faculty involved in the motivational system shared with beasts is the *animal control system*.

The evolutionary advantage of a normative control system can be illustrated by considering the evolutionary advantage of language. Language evolved to facilitate both complex coordination among individuals and complex individual plans. In order for this to have been possible, words must be motivating. Norms can be conceived of as linguistically encoded precepts. The normative motivational system is a linguistically infused kind of motivation that evolved because of the advantages of coordination and planning through language. The normative control system evolved as part of the evolution of human linguistic abilities, which came sometime after the animal control system.

### Internalizing and Accepting a Norm

Within the normative motivational system, we can distinguish between *internalizing* a norm and *accepting* a norm. To *internalize* a norm is to have a motivational tendency of a particular kind to act in the manner prescribed by the norm. The particular kind of motivational tendency is the component of our motivation involved in coordination. This ability is shared with other social animals. Internalizing a norm needn't involve explicit awareness of the norm or even an ability to formulate the norm when queried, but can nevertheless coordinate one's behavior and may be formulated by a sophisticated observer (think of unspoken cultural norms such as those concerning conversational distance). 

*Accepting* a norm consists in a disposition to avow the norm in unconstrained normative discussion, as a result of demands for consistency in the positions they take in normative discussion. Accepting a norm seems peculiarly human and seems to require language. Normative discussion consists in working out what we are to do or think or feel under real and hypothetical situations. In other words, normative discussion is the social coordinating procedure by which we determine which norms to accept. The evolutionary advantage of normative discussion is its ability to tend to consensus in the norms we accept, because shared evaluation is central to human life as it serves biological functions of rehearsal and coordination. The two mechanisms by which normative discusssion tends to consensus are mutual influence and a responsiveness to demands for consistency. Without these characteristics, normative discussions would not be a useful adaptation.

This allows for another kind of motivational conflict, this time a conflict with the normative control system. Oftentimes, we may *internalize* norm X at the expense of norm Y even though we *accept* that norm Y outweighs X in that situation, i.e. we judge it rational to follow norm Y but we are moved most by norm X (e.g. consider the Milgram's experiments). Judging something to be rational, then, need not involve being motivated most by that norm compared with other norms..
