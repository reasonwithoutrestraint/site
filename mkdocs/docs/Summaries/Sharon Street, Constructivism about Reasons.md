## Introduction

There is no value independently of our valuing. Things are ultimately valuable because we take them to be. While there are no normative truths that hold independently of our normative attitudes (against realism), we can still go wrong about our normative judgments. Our reasons are ultimately a function of the reasons that we take ourselves to have. Any mistakes we make about reasons will be made on our own terms, not some attitude-independent standard.

Constructivist views in ethics understand the correctness or incorrectness of some (specified) set of normative judgments as constituted by whether those judgments withstand some (specified) procedure of scrutiny from the standpoint of some (specified) set of further normative judgments. Importantly, the correctness is *constituted* by the constructivist procedure, not merely *indicated*, *discovered* or *coincident* with the constructivist procedure (for, if the latter were true, there could be a constructivist procedure that was coincident with any ethical theory). It is not that there is truth out there independently that the constructivist procedure discovers; rather, being the upshot of the constructivist position just is what it is for a normative judgment to be correct.

There are three components of any constructivist view:

1. Target set of normative judgments: the set of normative judgments to which the account of correctness is meant to apply. The reasons that are the subject matter of these normative judgments are the *results* of construction.
2. Procedure of construction: the procedure of reflective scrutiny that is involved.
3. Grounding set of normative judgments: the set of normative judgments from the standpoint of which the procedure of reflection is undertaken. The reasons that are the subject matter of these normative judgments are the *materials* of construction.

*Restricted* constructivism makes these claims about the nature of correctness to some specific, restricted subset of normative judgments. *Metathical* constructivism makes these claims about the nature of correctness to all normative judgments.

## Restricted Constructivism

### Examples

Restricted Constructivism state that the truth of a claim within a certain restricted set of normative claims (e.g. social justice, moral rightness/wrongness, etc.) consists in being entailed from within a substantively characterized practical point of view. An account of the truth is some limited subset of normative claims is reduced to what is entailed from a further set of substantive normative claim, which are taken for granted. 

##### Rawl's Conception of Justice

* Target set of normative judgments: judgments about social and political justice in a liberal democratic society.
* Results of construction: Rawl's two principles of political justice. 
* Procedure of construction: Original Position - rational agents, conceived of as representatives of a liberal democratic society and subject to what Rawls calls "reasonable conditions", select principles of justice to regulate the basic structure of society.
* Materials of construction: Two normative conceptions: (1) the conceptions of persons as free and equal, and (2) the conception of society as a fair system of cooperation over time. These normative conceptions are taken to be implicit in the public political culture of a liberal democratic society.
* Grounding set of normative judgments: our judgments endorsing the two normative conceptions of the materials of construction.

The standard of correctness in question is a standard of *reasonableness* rather than a standard of *truth*. 

##### Scanlon's Contractualism

* Target set of normative judgments: judgments about right and wrong, judgments of morality concerning "what we owe to each other".
* Results of construction: an indefinite number of moral principles, which specify which facts are permissibly counted as reasons when we deliberate about what we owe to each other.
* Procedure of construction: the contractualist formula under which 'an act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any set of principles for the general regulation of behavior that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement.'
* Materials of construction: See below
* Grounding set of normative judgments: the judgment that we have reason to 'live with others on terms that they could not reasonably reject insofar as they are motivated by this ideal.'

### Observations about Restricted Constructivism

1. When assessing the correctness of the target set of normative judgments, the question is not whether anyone thinks the judgments withstands the specified scrutiny; the question is whether it does. 
2. These specific restricted constructivist theories may or may not be circular, but restricted constructivist need not necessarily be circular. To avoid circularity, a version of restricted constructivism must simply avoid including the results of construction among its materials of construction. 
3. In many cases, it is thought that in many cases (though not all) the question whether a given target normative judgment stands up to the specified procedure of scrutiny has a determinate answer.
4. Radical choices plays no role in restricted constructivist views. The results of construction and the materials of construction are decided via reflection based on further judgments about reasons.
5. The method of reflective equilibrium is employed throughout the process of fashioning the overall restricted constructivist view, e.g. identifying the relevant set of grounding normative judgments, in formulating the constructivist procedure, assessing the results of the procedure, etc.
6. Restricted constructivist theories are in principle compatible with any metaethics views as they are agnostic about the correctness conditions of the grounding set of normative judgments. However, they do give a limited expression of a metaethical insight - they express that the standards of correctness for normative judgments should not be understood as set by an indpendent order that holds apart from agents' normative commitments, but rather from the standpoint of someone who accepts further normative judgments. From nowhere, there are no normative facts.

## Metaethical Constructivism

### Formal Characterization

Restricted constructivism does not specify a conception of correctness for the grounding judgments. Metaethical constructivism affirms that the correctness of the grounding judgments is constituted by withstanding scrutiny from other normative judgments. It is a mistake to ask about the correctness of any normative judgment in the utter abstract, without making references to a standpoint constituted by some further set of normative judgments. This is because there are no judgment-independent standards of correctness in the normative domain. 

Formal characterization: the fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself. This does not rule out the possibility that for a given X and Y, X is a reason to Y for every agent, no matter what his or her particular normative judgments.

Here is how metaethical constructivism specifies the various elements of all constructivist views:

- Target set of normative judgments: all normative judgments.
- Results of construction: all reasons.
- Procedure of construction: a purely formal characterization that does not presume any substantive content.
- Grounding set of normative judgments: the set of all of the agent's normative judgments, minus the normative judgment whose correctness is in question.
- Materials of construction: this is not appropriate for metaethical constructivism.

### Withstanding Scrutiny

It is constituitive of judging that one has conclusive reason to do Y that one also, when attending matters in full awareness, take oneself to have reason to take what one recognizes to be the necessary means to Y. One cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y. The force of *cannot* is not rational, but conceptual. If someone "judges" that she has conclusive reason to Y, while also in full awareness also "judging" that she has no reason to take what she recognizes to be the necessary means to Y, then she isn't making a *mistake* about her reasons; rather, she doesn't count as genuinely making the "normative judgment" at all. Likewise, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y. More broadly, one cannot simultaneously believe two contradictory propositions in full awareness.

This explains how there can be standards of scrutiny which might allow for one to be incorrect about their normative judgment. One can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments. For example, if one takes themselves to have conclusive reason to do Y, they might be mistaken in judging that they have zero reason to X (which happen to be the necessary means for Y), only if they are unaware that X is the necessary means for Y. Likewise, one can mistakenly believe two inconsistent propositions, but only if they are unaware that those two propositions are in fact inconsistent. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments.

Normative judgments are different from both beliefs and desires. Normative judgments differ from beliefs in that they are by their nature motivating. Yet they also differ from desire in virtue of the constituitive features mentioned earlier. For example, while judging that one has reason to live constituitively requires judging that one has reason to undergo leg amputation that one knows is necessary, the attitude of desire is not analgous: one can desire to live while having no desire to undergo leg amputation. 

### Observations about Metaethical Constructivism

1. As with restricted forms, when assessing the correctness of the target set of normative judgments, the question is not whether anyone thinks the judgments withstands the specified scrutiny; the question is whether it does. 
2. Whether a given normative judgment withstands scrutiny makes no normative assumptions, but instead uses the constituitive features making a normative judgment. Insofar as someone fails to meet these standards in full awareness, they are not determined to be wrong; rather, they aren't making normative judgments to begin with.
3. In many cases, it is thought that in many cases (though not all) the question whether a given target normative judgment stands up to the specified procedure of scrutiny has a determinate answer. However, there may be indeterminacy in particular cases when the standards legislated by a person's other normative judgments are insufficient to yield a result one way or another.
4. There is no reason given to support having any reasons whatsover. So the decision to make normative judgments is simply a radical choice.
5. If the method of reflective equilibrium is understood as identical with determining whether a given normative judgment "withstands scrutiny", then a normative judgment being endorsed under reflective equilibrium is constituitive of what it is for that normative judgment to be true.
6. This is a full-fledged metaethical position. It proposes an informative account of the truth conditions of judgments about practical reasons. This account which addresses metaphysical and epistemological questions about normative reasons, reconciles our understanding of reasons with a naturalistic understanding of the world, and explains the connections between reasons, judgments about reasons, and motivation.

Metaethical constructivism is in one sense a reductionist view and another sense not. It is not reductionist in the sense that it does not reduce the concept of a reason to non-normative terms. But it is reductionist in the sense that it reduces facts about to facts about what we judge to be reasons, where the latter is understood in a way that is priori to and independent of the former. The concept of a reason is taken as primitive - just as our color concepts cannot be understood except by experience, so too the concept of a reason cannot be understood except by experience.
