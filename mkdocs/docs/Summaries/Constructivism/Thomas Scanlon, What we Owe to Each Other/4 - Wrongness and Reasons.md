# Wrongness and Reasons

## Overview

## Moral Motivation

The problem of explaining motivation is to explain the reason-giving force of judgments of right and wrong.
The label "problem of motivation" is slightly misleading in two ways:
1. It suggests that we are concerned with motivation *as opposed to* reasons, but there's no distinction.
2. It suggests a problem of reasons/motivation for *action*.
The latter implies that we are concerned with how we can be motivated to act morally in the face of strong countervailing reasons. 
The latter suggestion is overly narrow interpretation.
Instead of being concerned with understanding what reasons we respond to when we consider right and wrong,
we should be concerned with *why* it's important that we respond to the reasons concerned with morality.

But saying that the question is about a "justification" for being moral can also be misleading for two reasons:
1. It suggests that those who already care about morality might abandon morality without a good justification.
2. It suggests that we are trying to persuade amoralists to care about morality by proving a justification.
These projects do not seem always possible.
We are concerned with addressing the problem of the moral "must" in two forms

1. Priority: That an action is wrong (almost) always constitutes sufficient reason to not do it.
2. Importance: Failure to respond to moral reasons seems to be a serious fault, but not one of irrationality.
The former concerns the attitudes of actors; the latter conerns evaluations by third-parties.
The latter doesn't just mean it's wrong *from a moral perspective*, but it's wrong in a more general sense.

## Formal and Substantive Accounts and Moral Motivation

Strategies for explaining the importance of morality can be analyzed along two dimensions.
They can be analyzed in terms of their moral content.
One could saw we have reason to be moral because that would be moral, but this faces triviality.
Another could be that we appeal to a nonmoral reason, such as personal benefits of being moral, but this seems inappropriate.
They can also be analyzed in terms of their degree of formality.
Formal explanations appeal to considerations independent of the appeal of any particular ends (e.g. Kant, Habermas).
Substantive exlpanations characterize the particular value concerned with morality.

Formal characterizations benefit by explaining the inespcapability of morality in that they are rationally required.
The problem is that this doesn't explain what's wrong with someone who fails to respond to morality.
E.g. the special force of moral requirements differ from principles of logic which are also rationally required.
Substantive accounts therefore seem more promising, but they may not give strong explanations of priority and importance.
However, the widest support have been substantive - God's will, human telos, and utilitarianism.
Utilitiarianism seems is because it identifies a substantive value that is both connected with morality and something of importance from outside of morality.
