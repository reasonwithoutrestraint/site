# The Structure of Contractualism

The importance of contractualism is not just its asserted necessary and sufficient conditions for an action to be right.
E.g. a consequentialist might agree that an action is wrong if and only if it could be justified to others on grounds that they could not reasonably.
However, consequentialism characterizes the notion of rightness/wrongness prior to justification.
Justification is a consequence of whether an action is right and wrong.
Contractaulism takes justification to be basic in two ways:
(1) Intersubjective justification provides the normative basis of right and wrong, and
(2) Intersubjective justification provides the most general characterization of its content.

Similar theories aim to show that morality (or some subdomain of morality) reduces to what people have reason to accept.
E.g. Kantian morality, Hare, Gauthier, Rawls, etc.
Each of these theories reduces morality to a claim about rationality, possibly with additional conditions to make it rational to take into account the interests of others.
E.g. Rawls is concerned with what is rational under the condition of having a lack of information about one's future position.
E.g. Guather is concerned with the rationality of seeking the benefits of cooperative pursuits.
Contractualism differs in that it is concerned with reasonable rather than rationality.
I.e. it is referring *directly* to our reasons to stand in mutual justification with others, not by showing how such could be rational under specific circumstances.

## Overview


## Reasonableness

One might ask, "Why not rely upon the idea of what would be *rational* for a person who has the aim of intersubjective justification"
The reason is that "rationality" has been understood to mean "what is most conducive to an agent's aims" (even though this conception is mistaken).
A claim about what it is "reasonable" for a person to do presupposes a certain body of information and a certain range of reasons which are taken to be relevant, and goes on to make a claim about what these reasons, properly understood, in fact support.

E.g. imagine parties are negotiating water usage in a country with one person who controls owns much of the water.
Assume that the landowner is not ungenerous and will sell/give water to anyone who desperately needs it.
Also assume that he is rather irritable; if we question his decisions, he will become upset and may refrain from sharing the water.
It would be *reasonable* for people there to demand a better distribution of water (i.e. not just in cases of desperation).
However, it might not be *rational* to make such a demand, since it could enrage the owner, leading to worse consequences.
It would be *unreasonable* for the owner to be ungenerous with the water.
However, whether it would be *irrational* for him depends on his particular aims.
Whether a principle is *reasonable* reflects a substantive judgment about the *merits* of the principle. 
Whereas a principle is *rational* depends on the consequences of accepting the principle. 

The idea of reasonable fits into the process of moral reasoning in the following manner.
In order to decide whether it would be wrong to do X, we need to consider possible principles governing how one may act.
We then need to ask whether any principle that permitted one to do X could be reasonably rejected.
To do this, we do the following 
(1) Consider the objections to permission: the burdens that would be imposed on some people if others were permitted to X.
(2) Consider the objections to prohibition: the burdens that would be imposed on some people if they were forbidden from X.
If the burdens with the objections to permission are more significant, then principles forbidding X cannot be reasonably rejected.

## Principles

An act is wrong if it would be disallowed by any *principle* that no one could reasonably reject.
To justify an action to others is to offer reasons supporting it, and to claim that those reasons are sufficient to defeat any objections that others may have.
But this is to also defend a principle: claiming that such reasons are sufficient grounds for acting under the conditions.
This is what is meant by principle.
The emphasis on principles is familiar in everyday moral reasoning, which differs from other evaluative judgments.
We don't usually merely judge *that* an action is wrong, but that it is wrong because of some reason, of some general characteristic.
In other evaluative domains, e.g. claims that something is beautiful or funny, the evaluative judgment comes first and an explanation later (or not at all).
Nor is there any pressure to provide reasons for one's evaluative judgments in other domains, such as aesthetics or humor.
However, there is a pressure and expectation for one to provide reasons for their moral judgments.

"Principle" is not meant to be a rule that can be applied to settle a wide range of questions without exercise of judgment.
There are very few moral principles of this kind, if any.
E.g. most people accept a principle against killing, but this cannot be understood as requiring no exercise of judgment.
E.g. people cannot hold that principle while also ackowledging exceptions, e.g. in defense, in war, euthanasia, etc.
Nor do the majority of people have a more foundational principle that explains when killing is wrong.
Rather, principles are general conclusions about the status of various kinds of reasons for action.
Principles can rule out some actions *by ruling out the reason for which they would be based*, but they leave wide room for interpretation and judgment.

How do we decide what forms of justification are *sufficient*?
Sometimes, this involves weighing the seriousness of conflicting interests or burdens (e.g. pro-tanto reasons).
But this also involves a more complex structure of reasons whereby some reasons are determined to be irrelevant (e.g. prima-facie reasons).
E.g. to determine when there can be an exception to a moral constraint, we can consider the rationale for having the moral constraint to begin with. 
E.g. Because of the nature of promises, avoiding minor inconvenience is not a reason to break a promise.
Because the very point of promises, and the moral constraint to follow them, is to ensure compliance even under inconvenience.

## Standpoints

Contractualism states that we have reason to consider whether there are standpoints other than our own from which a principle could be reasonably rejected.
Note that this standpoint is broader than the standpoint of a particular agent that would be affected by a particular action.
This is because we must take into account the consequences not just of the particular action.
We also must take into account the consequences of the general performance or non-performance of such actions.
And we must take into account the consequences of having agents be licensed and directed to think in the way directed by the principle.

If we are required to perform a certain action or that certain actions are forbidden, this can affect the way we plan and organize our lives, regardless of whether any occasions of the relevant sort present themselves.
E.g. if someone were obligated to provide food for strangers who came by, someone would have to take this into account during shopping and consumption, which affects the live of this person, regardless of whether such an event actually happened.

Since we don't know which particular individuals will be affected by a principle, our assessment of a principle cannot be based on particular aims, preferences of characteristics of specific individuals.
We must rely on Generic Reasons: based on commonly available information about what people have reason to want.
E.g. we commonly accept that people have reason to want to avoid bodily injury, to have bodily integrity, to have time to give special attention to our own projects, friends, etc.
Generic reasons are reasons that people have in virtue of their situation, characterized in general terms.
This does not mean they are limited to reasons that the majority of people have.
E.g. a minority might have reason to reject a principle in virtue of a characteristic that can be characterized in general terms.
