# Values

## Summary 

This chapter uses the notion of a reason to provide a general characterization of value.
Value is often taken to be interchangeable with "The Good", which is treated as distinct from "The Right".
In general, it has distorted our thinking about the relation between rightness and other values.
The Good concerns what we have reason to desire, whereas The Right concerns what we have reason to do.
The emphasis on "The Good" has had a distoring effect on thinking about value in general.
In general, it has distorted our thinking about the relation between rightness and other values.
**Our notion of value is broader than the teleological conception identified as "The Good".**

The telological view of value/goodness is that *all* bearers of value are states of affairs.
What we have reason to do (with regard to value) is to realize the best states of affairs.
The class of things that can be intrinsically valuable is broad; it can even include actions.
Such an account of value seems to be make deontology strange, as it endorses disrespecting value.
i.e. even if actions are intrinsically vaulable, deontology prohibits disvaluable action even when it minimizes those actions.

One reason for assuming this teleological framework is a teleological framework of reasons.
This states that all rational action aims at a result. 
Thus, reasons for action must appeal to the desirability of the occurrence of the action. This is sometimes the case.
**But a teleological account of reasons cannot explain the hierarchical structure of reasons mentioned in Chapter 1.**
We can judge that the desirability of the occurrence of an action is irrelevant.
i.e. prohibitions against murder might say: the value of a murder is not a morally relevant consideration.
A deontologists should say that instead of assigning a negative value to killing.

**To value friendship is to endorse certain reasons: to be loyal, care about friend's interests, etc.**
Reasons of this kind are not teleological in nature, e.g. to not betray them, etc.
The primary reason to be loyal is not that this is necessary for the friendship to continue to exist.
e.g. Someone doesn't value friendship if they betrayed friends to promote friendship.
To hold friendship as valuable is to think the reasons involved in valuing friendship are good reasons to hold.
Value in this instance cannot be understood as teleological reasons to promote something into existence.

**To *value something* is to take oneself to have reasons for holding certain positive attitudes towards it.**
Exactly what these reasons are, and what attitudes they support, will be different in different cases.
Valuing something often involves seeing reasons to preserve/protect it (e.g. a historical building).
It sometimes involves reasons to promote it (e.g. pleasure).
It sometimes involves reasons to be guided by the goals and standards that the value involves (e.g. loyalty).
**To claim that something *is valuable* is to say that others have reason to value it.**
E.g. I value my health, wouldn't say it is valuable in that others have reason to value it the way I do.

This uses a "buck-passing" account of value.
Being valuable is not a property that provides us with reasons.
**To call something valuable is to say it has other properties that provide reasons.**
Judgments about goodness express practical conclusions about reasons for acting or responding in a certain way.
While such conclusions are made due to recognition of certain natural properties, 
recognition of those properties don't necessitate the practical conclusions.
This account should be distinguished from a Moorean-esque account which says that there is a simple, unanalyzable, non-natural property that provides agents with reasons to adopt certain attitudes.
These intuitions support the rejection of this Moorean-esque account:
(1) The reasons for positive attitudes towards things are provided by the natural properties of those things.
	There is no further that could be done by special reason-providing properties of goodness and value.
(2) Many different things can be good or valuable and the grounds for these judgments vary widely.
	There does not seem to be a single, reason-providing *property* common to all these cases.

**Because of the variety of value and their associated responses, a systematic theory of value is implausible.**
Understanding something's value requires not just knowing how valuable it is, but also knowing how to value it.
The different attitudes seem unlikely to be accounted for by a theory of *what is* valuable.

Everyone can agree that human life has value.
**What is central to the value of life is not existence or anything teleological in nature.**
Appreciating the value of human life involves seeing reason not to destroy it and reason to protect it.
However, this does not flow from the thought that the existence of human life is a good thing.
If so, the reason to preserve and not destroy human life would be the same as our reasons to produce human life.
But clearly the reasons to preserve life are stronger than reasons to produce it.
Appreciating the value of human life is a matter of seeing human lifes as something to be respected.
This usually involves preserving and not destroying life, but not necessarily.
E.g. one would not disrespect human life to commit/assist suicide due to incapacitating pain.
**Our reasons for protecting life are qualified on whether the person in question has reason to live.**
**This has nothing to do with the value of the promotion or existence of life.**

## Introduction

This chapter uses the notion of a reason, the most basic element of normative thought.
The notion of a reason is used to provide a general characterization of a more specific normative notion, value.
This provides the basis for the remainder of the book, which discusses the forms of value involved in rightness/wrongness.

Value is used in both moral and non-moral senses, such as when one talks about the value of life versus the value of art.
Value is often taken to be interchangeable with "The Good", which is treated as prima facie distinct from "The Right".
The Good concerns what we have reason to desire, whereas The Right concerns what we have reason to do.

The emphasis on "The Good" has had a distoring effect on thinking about value in general.
In general, it has distorted our thinking about the relation between rightness and other values.
Our notion of value is broader than "The Good" as often understood in philosophical discussion.
Value is not exclusively concerned with how the world could be best, or what's best for particular people.
This makes the distinction between rightness and other values less stark.
This is because other values, e.g. art, science, love, friendship, etc., have similar structure to that of rightness/wrongness.

## Teleology

The telological view of value/goodness is that the bearers of value are states of affairs (possibly including over time).
Agents are related to states of affairs consists of being able to realize/prevent them.
What we have reason to do (with regard to value) is to realize the best states of affairs.
This purports to be a formal feature of goodness/value rather than a substantive view about which things are good.

This telological structure is often accompanied with a number of other views about value.
Three such views are found in universalistic hedonism, which states that the value of a state of affairs is determined by the amount of pleasure that it contains. Those three other views are:

1. Actions have no intrinsic value. 
	The value of an action is determined by the value (pleasure) of its consequences
2. This value is impartial. 
	Everyone's pleasure is taken into account. 
	And the value of the state of affairs gives every agent the same reason to promote it.
3. The value is additive.
	The value of a state of affairs is the sum of the values of its component parts.

Note that these views are logically independent and not all shared by all telological views.

1. Some telological views state that actions themselves can have intrinsic value.
2. It might characterize the good from a particular individual's point of view about what reasons *he* has.
3. It can hold that the value of a state of affairs is not the sum of the value of certain of its elements.

The question is whether value has this telological structure.
Support for this can be illustrated by considering controversy between consequentialist and deontological moral views.
Purely teleological conceptions of value are obviously shared by those accept a consequentialist account of morality.
But even deontologists tend to accept a teological account of value (they reject reducing rightness to value promotion).
Some even see reasons against doing an action that would have better consequences as "formally puzzling".

This puzzle seems difficult because of what lies at the heart of consequentialism: maximizing rationality.
This is the idea that if one accepts the desirability of a goal, and if one has a choice between two options, then it is better to choose the option that will better accomplish the goal, all things else being equal.
This is a familiar/fundamental conception of rationality that we accept within a very wide range of contexts.
This conception of morality presents a challenge for deontologists.
First, the idea is that prohibited actions must be regarded as "morally undesirable" (certain actions have intrinsic value).
Second, this suggests that the occurrence of those actions is is intrinsically bad, meaning we have the goal of minimizing it.
The problem is that deontologists reject doing certain actions even when they have better consequences, violating the goal.

This argument assumes that the negative intrinsic value attached to morally undesirable actions is impartial.
So it might seem that a deontologists is forced to accept a non-impartial conception of value.
But this is assuming we accept the teleological framework of value to begin with. Why?
One reason for assuming this teleological framework is a teleological framework of reasons.
This states that because all rational action aims at a result, reasons for action must appeal to the desirability of the occurrence of the action.
While this is sometimes true, it is not always true because of the structure of reasons mentioned in Chapter 1, Section 10.
Many of the reasons bearing on an action concern the (in)eligibility of other reasons, not the desirability of outcomes.
E.g. judging that a consideration doesn't count as a reason is not to assign a negative value to using it as a reason.
Such a value can be outweighed by a countervailing value, but a judgment that a consideration is irrelevant cannot.
E.g. deontological prohibitions against murder might say: the value of a murder is not a morally relevant consideration.
I.e. one need not appeal to the "negative intrinsic value" of killing.

The "all else being equal" clause can be read as "unless the action conflicts with another goal with overriding value."
As argued in Chapter 1,this conception fof a goal is mistaken.
Accepting something as a goal does not just involve attaching positive value to its accomplishment.
We also give it a particular status in our lives, such as a long-term career objective or whim, etc.
The intentions that constitute adopting the goal specify the contexts where the goal is to be pursued.
This needs to be included in the "all else being equal" clause.

The idea that "the good" is "what we have reason to promote" might seem natural.
However, by considering common instances of the good, it is implausible that all value can be characterized in this manner.

## Values: Some Examples

In claiming that certain things are valuable, philosophers often mean that it is good that they occur.
But when we consider things that are generally held to be intrinsically valuabel, this characterization does not hold.

It may be true that the existence of friendship and the pleasures it brings make the world better.
But it seems odd to suggest that this is what is central to the value of friendship.
To value friendship is to endorse certain reasons: to be loyal, to care about friend's interests, to stay in touch, etc.
It might be that one also believes they have reason to promote and keep friends for themselves and others they care for.
But it seems overblown to say that the importance of friendship is its promotion of value in the universe.

Reasons of the first kind (non-promotional) are not teleological in nature, e.g. to not betray them, etc.
The primary reason to be loyal is not that this is necessary for the friendship to continue to exist.
Also, the first class of reasons are primary: someone doesn't value friendship if they betrayed friends to promote friendship.
Technically what it is to hold friendship as valuable versus what is involved in valuing friendship are distinct notions.
To hold friendship as valuable is to think the reasons involved in valuing friendship are good reasons to hold. 

The claim that science and knowledge are intrinsically valuable supports a number of different conclusions about reasons.
First, people with the required aptitude have reason to devote their lives to scientific inquiry.
Second, is that scientists have reason to work hard, tackle significant issues, report results accurately, etc.
Third, non-scientists have reason to support scientific work as taxpayers or benefactors.
Fourth, we have reason to study science and try to understand it.
Fifth, we have reason to respect science and admire its achievements.

One can try to explain these reasons on a teleological basis: about the value of states of affairs that science provides.
They could say: it is intrinsically valuable to have a world where nature is understood and investigated.
While it has simplicity and evident appeal, it doesn't seem to explain the reasons associated with valuing science.
Such value especially doesn't seem to explain why non-scientists have reason to try to understand it.
More importantly, it seems strange that the reasons we have to study science can be found by first identifying how it would be better for the world to be, and then those explaining reasons by explaining how certain activities achieve that world.
Although the actions involved in scientific inquiry are aimed at some end, the best account of our reasons for those actions may not flow *from* the value of those results *to* our concern with them.

A better explanation is the reverse: we have good reason to be curious about the natural world and understand how it works.
Scientific inquiry is the best way to respond to that curiosity.
It follows that we have good reason to study science and for scientists to create new and better theories.
Thus, we can correctly regard the achievements of these goals as (even intrinsically) good.

## An Abstract Account of Values

To value something is to take oneself to have reasons for holding certain positive attitudes towards it.
Exactly what these reasons are, and what attitudes they support, will be different in different cases.
Valuing something often involves seeing reasons to preserve/protect it (e.g. a historical building).
It sometimes involves seeing reasons to promote it (e.g. pleasure).
It sometimes involves seeing reasons to be guided by the goals and standards that the value involves (e.g. loyalty).

To claim that something is *valuable* is to say that others have reason to value it.
E.g. I value my health, but I wouldn't say it is valuable in that sense that others have reason to value it the way I do.

There are two elements of this structure of value:

1. Value is not a purely teleological notion
2. The "buck-passing" account of value:  
	Being valuable is not a property that provides us with reasons.
	To call something valuable is to say it has other properties that provide reasons for having certain attitudes towards it.

This account of value can be led to by reflections of Moore's open-question argument.
We judge things to be good because of other properties they have.
But being good cannot be identified with any of those natural properties.
Judgments about goodness express practical conclusions about reasons for acting or responding in a certain way.
While such conclusions are made due to recognition of certain natural properties, 
recognition of those properties don't necessitate the practical conclusions.
This account should be distinguished from a Moorean-esque account which says that there is a simple, unanalyzable, non-natural property that provides agents with reasons to adopt certain attitudes.

There are two intuitions that support buck-passing accounts of goodness and value:

1. It seems that the reasons for positive attitudes towards things are provided by the natural properties of those things.
	There is no further that could be done by special reason-providing properties of goodness and value.
	Nor is it clear how goodness and value could provide additional reasnos.
2. Many different things can be good or valuable and the grounds for these judgments vary widely.
	There does not seem to be a single, reason-providing *property* common to all these cases.

Because of the variety of valuable things and their associated responses, a systematic theory of value is implausible.
Understanding the value of something is not just a matter of knowing how valuable it is, but also of knowing how to value it.
E.g. people who disagree over how to value certain music (whether to play it in restrooms versus study it in deep contemplation) are disagreements about value that are about the attitudes appropriate to the value.
This cannot be explained by a theory about what makes something valuable that ignores the attitudes.

## The Shadow of Hedonism

One explanation of the wide adoption of teleological conceptions of value is the connection with hedonism.
While hedonism has been abandoned as a theory of value, its teleological structure has remained.
This explanation is unconvincing because the appeal of a teleological structure requires some theory of value to support it.
On a different non-hedonistic theory of value, we wouldn't have reason to associate value with "to be promoted".
Another explanation is that there are many different values (e.g. wellbeing) that fit the teleological model.
These values then figure prominently in examples that are cited to trigger consequentialist intuitions.

Another explanation is that reasons are commonly reduced to what we desire, or have reason to desire.
And the objects of desires are states of affairs.

## The Value of Human (or Rational) Life

Everyone can agree that human life has value.
One might claim that this means that it is a good thing that human life exists.
This might be true, but what is central to that value is not existence.
Appreciating the value of human life involves seeing reason not to destroy it and reason to protect it.
However, this does not flow from the thought that the existence of human life is a good thing.
If so, then the reason to preserve and not destroy human life would be the same as our reasons to produce human life.
But clearly the reasons to preserve human life and not destroy human life are stronger than reasons to produce it.

Appreciating the value of human life is a matter of seeing human lifes as something to be respected.
Usually this involves preserving and not destroying life, but not necessarily.
E.g. one would not disrespect human life to commit suicide due to incapacitating pain.
Rather, our reasons for protecting life are qualified on the whether the person in question has reason to live.
The value of life can be identified with the reasons for one to live it.
