# Constructivism about Normativity: Some Pitfalls

"The most ambitious version ofconstructivism in contemporary philosophy is constructivism about normativity or practical reason. My agenda in this chapter is to offer a limited assessment ofthis view. I begin by sketching the main features ofthe constructivist position, situating it in relation to other approaches, and highlighting its most important claims. My implicit touchstone in this part ofthe chapter will be the work on normativity by Christine Korsgaard, who has done more than anyone else to advance a kind of Kantian constructivism as a systematic approach to these issues.

I then discuss some potential objections to the constructivist approach to normativity. There are three potential pitfalls that I shall focus on, which may be referred to with the slogans "psychologism," "bootstrapping," and "theory of error." I believe that satisfactory responses are available to the first two objections, and my discussion of them will help to bring into focus the appeal ofthe constructivist view. But I shall argue that the last issue poses serious problems."

## Normativity and Normative Skepticism

### Normativity

Normativity is commonly understood at least partly in terms of reasons. 
"Reasons are considerations that recommend or speak for (and against) prospective attitudes or responses on the part of a person or agent." Reasons for belief are considerations related to one's judgments about reality. 
Reasons for action are considerations related to one's intentions. 

Both kinds of considerations have a constitutive connection to *deliberation*.
Deliberation is reflection that aims to resolve the question of what one is to think or do. 
Reasons and rational requirements are considerations that are constitutively suited to figure in deliberative reflection of this kind. 
Thus, normative considerations have an intrinsic authority for deliberative reflection. 
Norms are the principles that state, in substantive terms, what people have reason to think and do. 
These formulate the structural requirements that govern rational reflection. 
One philosophical question is how to make sense of the authority of normativity.

### Skepticism

Another philosophical question is how to relate normativity to the world of natural objects and processes. 
One answer is a skeptical response motivated by philosophical naturalism: instrumental rationality. 
Instrumental rationality states that has one rational requirement for deliberation: to take the means to satisfy his ends.
There are no other norms of practical reasoning.
Any other norm would presuppose objective reasons and values, which is inconsistent with naturalism. 
The problem with this argument is that it itself presupposes objectives reasons, i.e a reason to adopt the means for one's ends. 
So a more consistent skepticism motivated by naturalism would be compelte normative skepticism. 
Complete normative skepticism holds that there are no correct norms of reasoning and deliberation. 
Deliberation is an intellectual activity without a subject matter. 

### Expressivism and Constructivism

One way to avoid this skepticism is to accept *expressivism*, 
Expressivism says that deliberations is an activity of imposing discipline on a set of practical attitudes. 
Practical thought is not an illusion because it does not attempt to make claims representing facts independent of the will. 
Rather, it is concerned with determinations of the will. 
Thus, the fact there are no mind-independent normative facts does not justify skepticism about normativity.

Constructivism agrees with expressivism in the rejection of realism, 
i.e. the rejection of normative truths that are prior to and independent of those who engage in deliberation about what to do. 
They also agree that practical thought consists of solving practical problems,
rather than identifying the solutions to theoretical questions or describing an independent reality. 
Constructivists diverge from expressivists in that constructivists postulate the existence of normative truths that depend on the will of those whom they regulate. 
The normative realm is constructed through our agency. 

Restricted forms of constructivism construct truth in particular normative realms by appealing to other truths in other realms. 
For example, contractualist normative theories derive truth for a particular domain (e.g. about Justice from Rawls, or Morality from Scanlon) by appealing to hypothetical choices while persupposing other normative truths, including reasons for action that are grounded in agents' projects, life plans, relationships, aspirations, etc.

Global forms of constructivism do not help themselves to an existing normative domain. 
The normative principles that govern the will are the principles that are constitutive of the will in the first place. 
E.g. Christine Korsgaard treats normative principles as standards that are constitutive of agency itself. 
The idea is that we commit ourselves to complying with certain normative principles insofar as we undertake action.

This is similar to expressivism because expressivists can agree that normative thought involves cognitive states whose contents are assessable as true or false and subject to the standards of truth-functional logic. 
Expressivists would explain this truth-aptness not as responsive to an independent domain of independent normative truths.
It is explained as an upshot of the structure of the motivational state that practical thought involves. 
Expressivists say we can earn the right to talk of normative truth because our agential commitments are appropriately patterned. 
The difference between constructivism and expressivism is that expressivism is interested in the semantic and logical properties of normative language, whereas constructivism is concerned with the truth-makers of normative assertions. 

## Three Pitfalls

### Psychologism

Because constructivism and expressivism attempt to explain distinct phenomena, they are not in competition. 
Expressivists are free to adopt the constructivist theory of normative truth.
Cconstructivists are free to adopt the expressivist theory of normative language and psychology. 
Constructivists are concerned with making philosophical sense of normativity, providing an explanation of how normativity is even possible. 

Korsgaard says that normative realism may be metaphysically, epistemologically and motivationally acceptable.
But it cannot amount to a comprehensive philosophical explanaiton of normativity. 
Normative realism cannot explain, in perfectly general terms, the authority of normative for deliberation.
i.e. it cannot explain how deliberative thought and motivation are answerable to normative considerations, in virtue of the nature of those considerations. 
Deliberative acivity is said to be answerable to principles that are prior to and independent of it. 
It might be intelligibly asked why we should care about such principles.

Constructivists explain the authority of normativity by appealing to considerations that become normative for us through the commitments that are constitutive of agency. 
This may seem to make constructivism seem psychologistic. 
Dark Parfit contends that this account of the authority equivocates between normative and psychological force. 
The argument is that constructivism can explain the latter but not the former. 
The skeptical question about authority should be understood in irreducibly normative terms.
Thus, constructivism has not explained what reason we have to accept principles that psychological govern the will.

But Korsgaard's constructivism should not be understood in these psychologistic terms. 
It should be understood in dialectical terms. 
It is not merely that a given agent is committed to a principle that answers the question of authority. 
Rather, it is that the principles are constitutive of agency that answers the question. 
The authority of *those principles* cannot be questioned at a fundamental level.

### Bootstrapping

Constructivism posits that our agential nature commits us to complying with the principles that define what we ought to do.
The question is what it is to be committed in this way.
One example is the instrumental principle, which says that an agent has reason to take the means to satisfy his chosen ends.
This can be explained because the attitude of intending a given end requiers a cmomitment to take the means to satisfy the end. 
One doesn't count as intending an end if they were not committed to intending the means.
The stance of commitment involves a kind of disposition or striving.

The stance of commitment is not sufficient to make principles normative for an agent.
Deliberation is a response to a practical question with multiple options for choice. 
This involves stepping back and reflecting on the authority of our initial desires and inclinations.
Thus, commitment is not a brute disposition or causal tendency. 
That sort of state is the kind that is stepped back from to be evaluated.
The state of commitment is an attitude of normative endorsement.
Being committed to a normative principle is not merely to be disposed to comply with it.
It requires regarding it as a rule that one has reason to follow in a special way.

This may seem to be an implausible form of bootstrapping. 
There should be a gap between normative endorsement of a principle and the actual normativity of a principle.
I.e. sometimes normative endorsement can be incorrect.
How can this be explained on constructivism?

Constructivism can explain local errors in normative reasoning, e.g. cases in which agents mistakenly ought or ought not do something.
We agents are not infallible in our normative endorsements.
Constructivists can explain this by appealing to procedures of ideal reflection.
Normative facts are determined not by *actual* normative endorsement, but *ideal* normative endorsement.
The hypothetical attitudes under *ideal* reflection determine what is normative for an agent.

But constructivism cannot explain global errors.
The totality of reflectively stable normative endorsements determines what is normative for an agent.
This seems implausible; its conceivable for there to be a gap between an agent's ideal normative endorsements and actual normative principles.
Constructivists must deny this gap.
Such a gap suggests that the practical deliberation is answerable to a realm of normative facts prior to and independent of the activity.
When we step back from the normative commitments that are constitutive of agency, normativity disappears from the scene. 

### Theory of Error

Constructivism explains error by appealing to the gap between actual normative endorsement and ideal normative endorsement.
There are two notions of commitment: (1) normative endorsement, and (2) specified rational procedures of reflection that would produce ideal normative endorsement.
(2) is required to allow for subsantive error in normative thinking.

The question is how to account for the authority of those procedures of reflection in (2).
The answer is to seek a dialectical acount of the normativity of the rational procedures.
These procedures are normative for agents because they are firmly anchored in (1) our actual normative endorsements.
In reflecting about why you should care about the specified procedures, you are already committed to accepting them.
This results in three problems from the constructivist position

1. This account of the authority of rational procedures suggests a rigorous restriction on the content of those procedures.
It seems only narrow principles - e.g. non-contradiction and the instrumental principles - are endorsed by all agents.
This is okay for Humean versions of constructivism, but not for Kantian versions.

2. This reintroduces the problem of local bootstrapping.
The procedures of ideal deliberation gain their authority from our actual endorsement.
Therefore, our actual endorsements must always grant provisional authority to other principles that are actually endorsed.
This may seem problematic.

3. Imagine a case of recalcitrant irrationality.
Imagine an agent who acknowledges that the procedural standards that they accept require a revision in their actual attitudes.
But they refuse to make the revision.
They care about their actual attitdes more than the principle of consistency.
Such a stance might be reflectively unstable (it wouldn't survive ideal reflection), but it could be very stable in practice.
It seems that this undervaluation of consistency is *irrational*. 
How can constructivism explain the normative authority of this irrationality?

One approach might be to simply insist that the agent is irrational. 
The constructivist will note that the agent cannot be consistent in their actual normative endorsements.
Therefore, we've proven that the agent's actual ends are normatively mistaken.
Thus, a significant gap can appear between an agent's actual normative endorsements and normative truth.
But this seems very similar to normative realism.

Another approach, i.e. Kosgaard, is to deny that the agent is irrational.
If a kind of creature fundamentally does not care about rational procedures of reflection, then those procedures are not normative for them.
We may call such agents "irrational" if we want, but there would be no normative force behind it.
An agent that doesn't value normative consistency or their idealized endorsements is not normatively mistaken on those grounds.
This seems to collapse the important distinction between norm and psychological fact.

"The constructivist might at this point appeal to facts about identity, arguing e.g. that the agent's actual motivations are less authentic somehow (or less "central" or "strongly held" or "truly their own") than the nonnative attitudes with which they conflict; compare Street 2008, pp. 234-6, who appeals to factS of this kind to draw distinctions within the class of an agent's normative attitudes. The challenge here will be to develop the notion ofidentity in a way that doesn't simply presuppose what is to be established, namely the authority ofan agent's normativejudgments. Highly relevant here is the extensive debate about identification set in motion by Frankfurt 1971 and Watson 1975"
