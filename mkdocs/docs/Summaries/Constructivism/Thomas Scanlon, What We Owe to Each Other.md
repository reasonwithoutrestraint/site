# What We Owe to Each Other

## Reasons

### Introduction

Scanlon takes the idea of a reason as a primitive.
Any explanation of what it is to be a reason always reduces to "a consideration that counts in favor of it".

Various attempts to explain reasons - dispositional, expressivist, etc. all seem unsatisfactory.
It's doubtful whether any general account of that kind could succeed.
Regardless, it doesn't matter whether such an account can be given.
Nothing in future sections/chapters depends one's account of reasons.
The claims made in later chapters are compatible with any deeper account of reasons.
This chapter is simply to describe the main contours of reasons.

This chapter also shows that there is no particular problem with reasons for action.
If there is any problem with reasons for action, then it applies to all reasons.
If the reasons related to moral wrongness need explanation, its the notion of moral wrongness, not reasons.	
	
### Judgment-Sensitive Attitudes

The are two kinds of reasons one might use: explanatory reasons and justificatory reasons.
Justificatory reasons are the standard, normative sense of reason that will be of concern here.
Operative reasons are the normative reasons an agent endorses for having an attitude.

Skepticism about reasons denies that we can make judgments about whether anything favors anything else.
But this form of skepticism is a very difficult position and awkward and unstable.
It is especially difficult in the case of reasons for belief.
Even for reasons for action, to hold this skepticism, one would need to regard all one's actions as events that happen.
One would abstain from deliberating about what considerations are for or against the action.

It makes no sense to demand a reason for an event that is unconnected with any intentional subject.
Reasons can only be asked/offered for the attitudes of rational agents, i.e. beliefs, intentions, fears, etc.
These must be distinguished from mere feelings such as hunger, tiredness, distraction, etc.
The class of attitudes for which there can be reasons is "judgment-sensitive attitudes".
These attitudes would be held by an ideally rational person if he judged there to be sufficient reason for them.

Having a judgment-sensitive attitude involves a set of complicated set of dispositions of reasons.
E.g. believing P involves the following dispositions
- feelings of conviction about P when the question arises
- affirmations of P in normal circumstances
- using P as a premise in further reasoning
- using P as a piece of counterevidence when incompatible claims are made
An attitude is judgment-sensitive if the associated dispositions are sensitive to a kind of judgment.
However, having the attitude also requires being disposed to various patterns of unreflective thought.

Because of this dependence, these attitudes can be properly attributed to us.
This is true even when they are not the result of a choice or decision, like beliefs, fears, hopes, etc. 

### Rationality

A rational creature is a reasoning creature.
They have judgment-sensitive reasons, i.e. are able to recognitive, assess, and be motivated by reasons.
This applies to attitudes such as beliefs, intentions, fear, admiration, etc.
Non-human animals act purposefully, but do not question whether a purpose provides reason for action.
Judgment-sensitive attitudes may arise spontaneously, without judgment or reflection.
But they are responsive to an agent's judgments in a number of ways:
1. Agents generally adopt the attitude P after making a conscious reflective judgment that P is warranted.
2. Agents generally don't have P after deciding that P is unwarranted.
3. Agents generally don't form unreflective attitudes that conflict with their standing reasons-judgments.

### Irrationality Narrowly Construed

Rationality involves systematic connections between a person's thought and behavior.
Irrationality occurs only when a person's attitudes fail to confirm to his/her own judgments.
Any other criticisms about an agent's attitudes/judgments are substantive questions about their reasons.
An agent might act against what they have reason to do without being irrational.

E.g. Imagine someone is convinced by a fallacious mathematical proof somehow.
That person would have done something they didn't have reason to do.
But they would not have been irrational.

Using a narrow construal of irrationality can defeat some arguments for reasons internalism.
E.g. one of Williams' argument for internalism is that it seems odd to say someone is irrational for not responding to an external consideration. Therefore, no external consideration could be a reason.
But an externalist could say the external consideration is just a reason, not a requirement of rationality.

### The (Most) Rational Thing to Do

There are some accounts of what we have most reason to do if we were "ideally rational".
These are often referred to as "conceptions of rationality".
But they are more appropriately seen as substantive conceptions of the reasons we have.

The distinction between rationality and reasons can be illustrated by thinking about future interests.
We often call people irrational for indulging in short-term gains that cause greater long-term losses.
This generally makes sense because this often involves someone acting against what they judge to be reasons.
But there is great disagreement over how one should weigh long-term versus short-term interests.
If someone discounted their future interests due to theoretical grounds, then they aren't irrational.

A full account of what an "ideally rational" agent would so involves at least 3 dimensions of idealization:
1. possession of full information about one's situation the cosnequences of possible actions
2. awareness of the full range of reasons that apply to someone in that situation
3. flawless reasoning about what these reasons support.

### Reasonableness

(un)Reasonableness lies between rational and the ideal of what it would be most rational to do.
Judgments about reasonableness are relative to a specified body of possibly information and range of reasons.
E.g. the reasonableness of a belief/action may be assessed relative to the agent's beliefs at the time.

But the grounds of assessment may be broader than this, if the reasons/information are available.
Oftentimes, we charge someone of unreasonableness when they ignore certain facts or reasons.
In these cases, a general aim or concern is presupposed, e.g. concern with other people's interests.
We sometimes say someone is being unreasonable insofar as they ignore this reason that we presuppose. 

### Reasons and Motivation

A rational person who judges there to be sufficient grounds for adopting attitude P usually adopts P.
This judgment is normally sufficient to explain their attitude as well.
There is no need to appeal to a further source of motivation such as "wanting to hold the attitude".

There is a distinction between judgments about reasons and the motivating effect of that judgment.
E.g. Imagine someone judges that the reasons for drinking (e.g. pleasure) are outweighed by the reasons against it (e.g. hangover the next day).
These judgments can have varying motivating force depending on the circumstance. 
E.g. at a party, the judged reasons for drinking might become more motivating than the reasons against.

However, this doesn't mean that there is a further motivating element in addition to judgments about reasons.
We don't need to posit e.g. a desire to explain the difference in motivation here.
The difference can be explained by the varying degree that one attends to certain considerations.
Still, the judgment about reasons are the only motivating factors.

One may think that a desire is requierd to explain akrasia.
But there actually is a similar phenomenon of akrasia with belief.
E.g. A person might judge that a known deceiver's appearance are not sufficient reason to trust him.
However, when in his presence, one may find their appearance to justify trusting him.
We don't need to posit a desire to explain akrasia when it comes to belief.
This can be explained by a difference in how one attends to certain considerations.

### Reasons and Desires: Motivation

Desires are commonly taken to be motivationally efficacious: desires are usually/always what motivates/justifies action.
There are two possible characterizations of desires:
1. Broad sense: includes any "pro-attitude", e.g. sense of duty, pride, interest in enjoyment, normative judgment, etc.
2. Narrow sense: unmotivated desires, not dependent on a different state for their motivating force. e.g. Thirst.
A non-trivial thesis claiming the motivational efficiaciousness of desires must be the narrow sense.

Even the narrow sense of desire often involves evaluative/normative judgments.
E.g. thirst involves (1) a dry sensation and (2) an evaluation that the sensation is bad.
It is the evaluation, not the sensation, that does the motivational/justificatory work. 

It might be objected that desire should be asociated with an urge or disposition instead of a sensation.
This is trivially necessary to be present in the case of any action.
But this doesn't seem to be what we mean by desire.
E.g. Consider a man who feels an urge to turn on every radio he sees.
But he doesn't think there's anything good about doing so; he has no end that would be fulfilled by doing so.
Such a purely functional/dispositional state doesn't seem to be what we mean by desire.
Nor does it provide anyone with reasons for action.

Having a desire, thus, involves having a tendency to see something as a reason.
Note that this does not mean that all desires are *derived from* evaluative/normative judgments.
This intuitive characterization of desire is the directed-attention sense of desire.
One has a desire that P if (1) his attention is commonly directed towards certain considerations and (2) those considerations present themselves as reasons for P.
A desire is a tendency for *unreflective seemings* of reasons, as opposed to *reflective judgments* of reasons.
This is similar to how white light though a red filter *seems* to be red, even though we *judge* (*believe*) it to be white.

Thus, one can have a reflective normative judgment with a conflicting directed-attention desire.
Akrasia is thus a conflict of evaluative judgments, not evaluative judgments and "non-evaluative" desires.
Motivation always stems from a normative/evaluative judgment, even when a directed-attention desires is the case.
Thus, motivation also can stem from an evaluative judgment, even when it conflicts with a directed-attention desire.

### Reasons and Desires: Justification

A common "subjectivist" position is that reasons must derive their justificatory force from an agent's desires.
Recall that the motivational/normative efficacy of desires is their connection with an (unreflective) evaluative judgment.
Thus, the "subjectivist" position holds that reasons derive their force from a connection to what we judge to be reasons.
Desires are assumed to be both independent of and the starting points of  practical reasoning. 
This section argues that desires in the direction-attention sense almost never independently provide reasons for action.

Consider someone who has a desire for X in the direction-attention sense, he seems to have a reason to promote X.
This "seeming" doesn't provide a reason when the agent doesn't endorse X on reflection (e.g. if X is unhealthy tasty food).
Perhaps desire X provides a reason when it doesn't conflict with a reflected evaluation, e.g. the food is healthy.
It might be said that such a reason would be based on the agent's desires, e.g. his future enjoyment (i.e. tastiness) of X.
But this is false: *future enjoyment* is not derived from present desire in the direction-attention sense.
If enjoyment provides an agent with reason to X, then this is independent of their present desire to X.

Perhaps an agent's plans determine his reasons for actions.
A plan is an aspect of practical reasoning that involves attributing reason-status to certain considerations.
Plans can be reflective or unreflective, i.e. when we unreflectively take a desire to provide a reason for action.
The state isn't the same thing as a desire, which makes things "seem" to be reasons.
Plans provide prima-facie reasons (and not desires) because plans are not taken to be independent sources of reasons.
Plans are instances of an agent's identifying certain considerations as reasons.
Thus, plans derive their reason-giving force on whether those considerations actually are reasons.

Thus, there are two kinds of ways that are reasons can sometimes be "subjectivist". Either
(1) are reasons are based on what we will find enjoyable or exciting in the future, or
(2) are reasons are based on what we have planned, i.e. what we have taken to be a reason in practical reasoning.
But neither of these are a state that is both (1) a *present* "desire" and (2) *independent* of practical reaosning. 

### Reasons and Desires: Structure

Desires are naturally understood as having a two-part structure.
They have (1) a state of affairs to obtain, and (2) a degree of "strength" towards that state of affairs.
On this view, when our desires conflict, rational decision involves balancing the strengths of competing desires.
Reasons can also conflict in similar ways as desires, when they support conflicting states of affairs.
Reasons/Desires in this sense are *pro tanto*, they provide defeasible reasons that can be overridden by other reasons.
E.g. one friend wants to watch a horror movie and another wants to watch a comedy.

But reasons can conflict in more complex, structural ways than desires.
I.e. I can judge that a certain consideration is a reason to not take another consideration as a relevant reason.
E.g. Whether the efficiacy of a certain chess move is a reason to do the move depends on my interests.
I.e. it provides a reason to make the move if I want to win, and it doesn't if I want to lose or don't care.
If I want to lose, it doesn't provide a defeasible reason, it provides *no* reason given the context.
Such reasons are *prima facie*. 
The standard desire model of practical reasoning cannot account for this structural complexity.

Reasons for beliefs also exhibits more structural complexity.
Sometimes we do weight evidence for and against certain propositions.
But this is only because our background beliefs indicates that those considerations are relevant in that context.
Generally, reasons for judgment-sensitive attitudes exhibit a complex structure unexplained by the standard desire model.
Of course sometimes we do weigh evidence for/against such attitudes. 
When we do, its because a more general framework of principles determines certain considerations to be relevant.
Much of our practical reasoning is involves finding principles to determine which/when considerations are relevant.

These principles are what Kant called maxims.
Adopting an end is not simply a matter of assigning a positive value to a certain class of results which they compete.
Rather, when we adopt an end we intend to pursue it as something with a specific role.
I.e. some ends are adopted for temporary amusement, a long-term hobby, a career goal, a life commitment, etc.
Depending on the role of a given end, different considerations will be relevant to whether to adopt the end.

It might be objected that the standard model can account for this by appealing to second-order desires.
I.e. when a reason for A makes irrelevant a reason for B, we have a desire (A) to not desire B.
But if second-order desires are just desires, there is the question of what gives them special authority.
When there is a conflict, there is no reason to chose the second-order desire, since all that matters is the relative weight.
This doesn't do justice to the feeling that the lower reason B is made irrelevant, not just that it has less strength. 

### Metaphysical Doubts about Reasons

This section explainsthe special features behind something being a reason, although they can't be reduced to another notion.
The things that are reasons are the things that can be contents of beliefs - propositions.
That some proposition is someone's operative reason is a fact about their psychological state.
The judgment that a proposition (if it were true) is a good reason has normative force that resists naturalistic reduction.

Some attempt naturalistic reduction by saying A has a reason to X iff A would regard X has a reason under circumstances C.
When C is non-normative, i.e. vividly aware of all relevant facts, there are 2 kinds of objections:
1. They don't seem obviously true. Some of us are better at assessing reasons than others due to our sensitivities (or lack theorof) of the relevant reasons (not due to lack of awareness). E.g. vivid awareness of the benefits of accepting bribes might make one more likely to regard doing so as good, but that doesn't provide one with a reason.
2. Even if it were always true, it wouldn't provide a reductive analysis for what being a reason. Saying R is a reason expresses a normative judgment while the righthand of the biconditional is a mere prediction of one's reactions.

There are 2 options for understanding normative judgments: as either (1) a kind of belief or (2) a special attitude.
One might object to (1) because such an account cannot explain the (a) normative authority, (b) metaphysics or (3) epistemology of the normative facts that are tracked by these beliefs.
It makes little difference to later work whether a belief or special attitude account is adopted.
But these objections are of interest as they hint towards a skepticism about reasons.
They hint that reasons they aren't about anything real; they are just expressions with no standard of correctness.
Here are some reasons to deny that such objections are worthwhile.

1. The considerations above apply to reasons of all kinds - reasons for belief as well as reasons for action.
2. Statements about reasons normally take the form of declarative sentences that obey normal laws of logic.
3. The Normative Authority objection applies to reduction of reasons to natural facts, not all facts, i.e. non-natural facts. 

It might be asked what kind of beliefs are normative reasons if not natural beliefs.
The only (unsatisfactory) response is that they are judgments about reasons, with no furhter reduction.

One might say that a mere belief cannot account for the inherent motivational aspect of reasons.
When an agent judges that they have reason to adopt atttide X, they will typically adopt the attitude.
This motivational aspect of practical reasoning cannot be explained by belief accounts.
But this motivational aspect is not always present in practical reasoning.
Consider cases when someone deliberates about what should be done in hypothetical/counterfactual scenarios.
The aspect of thought involved in the practical reasoning is identical, but there is no motivation.
This implies that the upshots of practical reasoning concerns whether something is taken to be true.
That we tend to adopt the attitudes that we find reasonable is because this is a part of being a rational creature.

It might seem puzzling how we can come to perceive a normative fact existing independently of our judgment.
But this is precisely the case with empirical beliefs; they concern facts that exist independently of our judgment.
One response is that our empirical beleifs are produced by natural objects via some reliable causal process.
But why is it that nothing can be called a belief unless it is forced via such a process in this manner?

It might replied htat if judgments about reasons can be true or false, then they must be about an independent subject matter.
This is true, but this independence provides no problem. 
Consider the case of mathematics for example.
We can make true judgments about mathematics, even though mathematical truth is independent and causally inert.

One might object that mathematics has judgments that seem incontrovertibly correct and general methods fo arriving at them.
There doesn't seem to be an analogous reliability regarding normativity.
Note however that this is a substantive objection regarding standards of correctness.
This is not a metaphysical/epistemological objection.
Further, it seems like we do have clearly standards for correctness for reasons when it comes to beliefs.
Whether this extends to reasons for action is a substantive matter, not a metaphyiscal/epistemological issue.

### How Do We Know What Reasons We Have

There are 4 stages in the consideration of a reason, not all of which need to occur in all cases:
1. Consideration X seems to be a reason for an attitude A (i.e. the evaluative component of a direction-attention desire).
2. The agent determines whether X really is a (pro-tanto) reason for adopting A.
3. The agent determines there is sufficient reason for adopting A given other considerations.
4. The agent adopts attitude A.

4 usually follows from 3 and most people accept 1 as uncontroversial. 
The question is about the authority of 2.
Why call 2 a process of correction rather than a mere change in reaction?
To answer this question, we need to see what 2 involves.

Imagine being confronted with something that seems like a reason (e.g. striking one's child for insolence).
The process first is to clarify what kind of reason it is supposed to be.
E.g. is the striking supposed to be good for the child or is it to demonstrate something about you?
Then one is to see whether the initial tendency stands the test of reflection.
If the initial tendency stands after reexamination, then one concludes that it really is a reason.

If one's attitude changes after reexamination, why assume its a correction?
1. The later attitude is supported by a clearly and more detailed conception of what the reason might be.
2. In virtue of the reflection, it is less likely to be affected by distorting factors such as rage.

The idea that rage is a distorting factor, rather than a reason, reflects a substantive judgment.
It is part of a background of judgments about reasons, e.g. reasons about what considerations (not rage) are relevant.
Not anything can count as a reason in certain contexts (e.g. that today is Monday cannot be a reason to strike someone).
The content of an attitude must provide guidance in identifying the kinds of considerations that could be reasons for it.
Note that the background judgments about reasons are not immune from criticism and revision.
One can imagine their background judgments and test them with other hypothetical/counterfactual/possible/actual cases.
They can then question whether those background judgments best explain their considered judgments in these other cases.

Thus, one feature of improvements in our normative judgments is their degree of stability.
When one has corrected their judgments upon reflection, the new reaction tends to become stable.
Another aspect is the degree of interpersonal agreement, e.g. that pleasure/enjoyment provides reasons, etc.
This applies both to reasoning about beliefs and about actions.
