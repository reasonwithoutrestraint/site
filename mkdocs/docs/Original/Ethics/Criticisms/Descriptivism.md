# Descriptivism

## Key features of Normativity

- Ubiquitous - 
- Disagreement (especially with morality) regardless of empirical agreement or linguistic/societal differences
- Rational/Deliberative - a priori
- Motivational - world to mind fit that sometimes conflicts with other motivations
- Supervenience - normative properties supervene on the natural properties

## Requirements for descriptivism

1. Must explain how the normative supervenes on the non-normative.
2. Must explain how a mind-to-world-fit state of mind can produce a mind-to-world fit sate of mind.
3. If there are normative facts, then either the normative facts need to somehow explain our normative judgments or else normative facts must consist in our (hypothetical or idealized) normative judgments. Otherwise, there would be no causal connection bewteen our normative judgments, on the one hand, and the normative facts, on the other. That would mean we could have no justification for any of our normative judgments, because in order to have justified belief in p, it must be the case that one's belief in p is reliably explained by the fact that p (e.g. the perception that the Earth is not moving is not evidence that the Earth is not moving, because that perception is not better explained by the fact that the Earth is not moving).
4. Attitude-independent theories of normative facts would have to posit that the normative facts are ontologically prior to our normative judgments, but nevertheless explain our normative judgments. This seems impossible under non-naturalism. Under naturalism, it gets more complicated.
5. Attitude-dependent theories of normative facts must not reduce normative facts to our actual attitudes, as this would prevent disconnections between our actual attitudes and our normative judgments, and it would also preclude coherent questioning of one's actual attitudes. Cannot be the basis of moral judgments because that would prevent coherent moral disagreement assuming all partiies were fully rational.
6. Must provide an explanation for how to translate our moral terms to/from cultures with other languages.
7. Under analytic naturalism, we must be able to replace our normative terms with non-normative terms without losing meaning.

## General Problems

General problems with ignoring non-descriptive attitudes

### Understanding non-descriptivism

*The dynamic meaning of judgments*. Consider two uses of the same term with the same descriptive content but with different meaning, e.g. using "gay" purely descriptively versus derogatorily. Now consider two different terms with the same meaning but whereby one has the dynamic content implicitly associated with it, e.g. "skinny" versus "bony".

*Examples of other domains of non-descriptive judgments*. E.g. aesthetics, tastes, etc.

*Necessity of non-descriptive judgments.* We would have needed to develop a system for expressing attitudes of approval, disapproval, and also for modifying the attitudes of others. It seems normative judgments definitely fulfill this role.

### Normativity doesn't require descriptivism

#### Normative education/expressions. 

We teach children to form certain moral judgments by molding their non-descriptive attitudes. 
This is done by rewarding/punishing behavior with various non-descriptive attitudes.
This shows examples of appropriate attitudes in certain circumstances.

#### Flexibility of language 

A ought to X, A needs to X, A must X, X is crappy, X is disgusting, etc. can all mean the same thing. 
This is best explained as prescriptions and/or expressions, rather than reports/descriptions. 
It is unlikely that the referrents of the terms in each of these expressions are descriptive of the same entity.
if they were descriptive of the same entity, how would we know?

#### Descriptivism unnecessary. 

All of our normative discourse can be explained without appeal to the existence of normative entities, or judgments about such properties.

### Arguments against Realism

*Motivation*. One can infer that an agent has a world-to-mind fit state of mind with respect to X if they judge that they have normative reason to X. With moral judgments, this is particularly true if they *exclaim* that a certain action is (im)moral. This is easy to explain if judgments of normative reasons are themselves world-to-mind fits. Otherwise, this is difficult to explain. Attributions of goodness to P have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any (non-)naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are *necessarily* action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only *contingently* action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.

*Translation* Imagine we are trying to translate words for descriptive concepts to another language. This involves picking an extension of the relevant concept that we can all agree with and finding the word from the other language that correlates with this extension. For example, if we want to find the translation for the word "red", we would establish an extension of the concept RED - e.g. blood, stop signs, crayons, etc. Then we would find which word in the other language is often used to refer to the entities in that extension. On the other hand, we cannot do this for normative terms. Firstly, it is doubtful that we could establish an extension of any normative concept that we all agree on. But, more importantly, even if we could, it would not be enough to find the foreign word that corresponds to this extension in order to translate the term. We would also need to know the other society's motivational and non-cognitive attitudes and dispositions with regard to the extension. For, it is conceivable that they could think that the extensions was either good or bad. This attacks all forms of non-naturalism and objectivist forms of naturalism.
-> Also imagine a culture with an identical nonverbal language of our own except that they didn't speak verbally. They used sign language predominantly to communicate. Some analysis of their movements would be reducible to expressions of beliefs. How would we analyze the meaning of showing a middle finger? How would we analyze a parent who angrily points at a child's bedroom (ordering him to go)? Imagine they needed to express more sophisticated thoughts using this language. Is it truly questionable whether they could express the entire range of human attitudes, including the attitudes themselves, dispositions to have the attitudes, endorsement of the attitudes? Is it questionable whether questionable whether they could use their language in a way to influence the behavior of others? Would we have any need to posit the existence of mind-independent action-guiding properties to explain the phenomenon? Would it change if they spoke verbally?

### Arguments against all Descriptivism

*Non-predicating*. Imagine someone asserts that some state of affairs or object has a certain normative property. What are they asserting is a property of that state of affairs or object? Nothing.

*Disagreement*. Descriptivism cannot explain the role of attitude in ethical disagreements. There are two forms of disagreement, (1) disagreements in belief (both cannot be true) and (2) disagreement in attitudes (cannot be satisfied). Note that reducing ethical judgments to *beliefs about attitudes* cannot account for this. If A believes he desires X and B believes he desires not-X, then these beliefs are not in disagreement because they can both be *correct*. E.g. A saying "X is good" and B saying "X is not good" would not be a contradiction, since it would amount to "A desires X" and "B does not desire X". In fact, they would both be *true*. But it seems that ethical disagreement can persist despite accepting these truths. 

Ethical disagreements commonly feature disagreements in attitudes and in beliefs. But attitudes play the primary role because (1) The attitudes determine which beliefs are relevant, and (2) Ethical disagreement persist after agreement in belief. Perhaps this is actually a disagreement in beliefs about each agent's idealized attitudes, where idealized attitudes are assumed to be convergent. Disagreement in idealized attitudes maybe can account for disagreements in certain normative domains, e.g. disagreements in desires, emotions, maybe even beliefs (i.e. we think other people would come to similar beliefs as us under idealized conditions, because our epistemic frameworks are assumed to be similar). But ethical disagreement can persist despite agreement about the beliefs of everyone's fully rational, fully informed attitudes. This is not the case with something like think art, humor, taste, etc. This is because ethical judgments have a *prescriptive* aspect in that they are meant to guide the behavior of other agents. Such prescriptions cannot *both* be actualized when they conflict.

*Beliefs and attitudes are logically independent* Take a descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that ascriptions of goodness to x express belief p to x. Take a non-descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that such ascriptions express non-descriptivist attitude q to x. Imagine an agent held q with regard to x but they did not hold p with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they judge x to be good. Now imagine that they held p with regard to x but they did not hold q with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they don't judge to be good.
