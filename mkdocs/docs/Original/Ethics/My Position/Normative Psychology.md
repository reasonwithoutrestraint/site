## The Deliberative Perspective

Intentional action can be explained from two perspectives, the *intentional* and the *deliberative*. From the intentional perspective, intentional action can be explained by citiing *motivating reasons*, i.e. by citing a belief-desire pair that fits into a pattern of teleological explanation. From the deliberative perspective, intentional action can be explained by citing *normative reasons*, i.e. by citing a pattern of rational deliberation that either did, or could have, produced it. This involves citing the considerations that one reflects over in deciding what to do. 

The deliberative perspective must be explanatory because when we decide what to do after deliberation, that often makes a difference in what we do. This would be impossible if the deliberative perspective were not explanatory, since the connection between deliberation and our action would be purely causally contingent. Thus, our attitudes towards the propositions that figure in our deliberations must be capable of figuring in an explanation of our action. 
kHowever, there must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action and the agent's motivating reasons for action.

??? note "Elaboration Possible"
	Similar disconnects happen even with fear, anger, and even beliefs.

To judge that one has normative reason to X is to *endorse* X under deliberation. Normative judgments then can be vaguely characterized as *deliberative endorsement* of some propositional content. Contrast this with undeliberative or unreflective endorsement, which can be the sources of one's *motivating reasons*, the explanation of their intentional behavior. Voluntary actions can be explained by a belief and desire; these actions are done on the basis of normative reasnoing insofar as deliberation and reflection play a role in how the belief and desire manifest into action, i.e. if deliberation influences what one desires, which desires are actualized, etc. 

## Requirements

An analysis must account for the following features of normative thinking and language:

1. Motivation
	- A person who judges themselves to have reason to adopt attitude X tends to adopt attitude X.
	- Normative-motivational disconnects: there are times when fails to adopt the attitudes they judge themselves to have reason to hold.
2. Disagreement
	- Two people can disagree about their normative judgments.
3. Reasoning/Discussion
	- A priori reasoning and discussion influence our normative judgments.
	- Normative-representational disconnects: any possible normative judgment and belief pair is possible. 
4. Ubiquity
	- We cannot get rid of normative judgments.
	- They apply to all possible attitudes that can be influenced by reasoning.
5. Semantics
	- Entail that there is no pair of normative statements and descriptive statements that are contradictory
	- Explains the insistence of normative language

## Direction of fit

The task is to determine the psychology of the state of mind characterized as *deliberative endorsement*. Is it a desire, belief of some sort, etc? The possible characterizations can be broadly seperated into two categories - world-to-mind states of mind and mind-to-world states of mind. Both are states of mind that that have propositional content as their objects, i.e. one has these attitudes with regard to p where p is some proposition. Mind-to-world states of mind are states whereby the propositional content of the attitude is meant to *correspond* to an external reality. E.g. one can have a belief that p where p is supposed to correspond to reality. World-to-mind states of mind are states whereby the agent is disposed to manipulate the world so that the proposition content of the attitude becomes true. E.g. if one has a desire that p, then they are disposed to try to make it the case that p is true. Whereas mind-to-world states have a *correspondence* role, world-to-mind states have a *dispositional* or *functional* and (broadly) emotional role (disposition/function need not be the *only* role of these states, but it is necessary).

One test for the direction of fit of an attitude is to determine whether the attitude persists upon observing evidence against the propositional content in question. For example, someone's belief in p will tend to diminish upon observing evidence against p being true. E.g. if someone *believes* that a presidential candidate C will win the election, this will (usually) tend to diminish as they observe evidence that C will lose, e.g. if polls and surveys indicate more support for C's opponent T, if C does poorly in debates, etc. On the other hand, if one *desired* that C win the election, then this attitude (usually) does not tend to diminish upon observing that C will not win. Like most desires, the desire here persists despite evidence against the truth of the corresponding propositional content.

Whatever the characterization is, not that there has to be a common characterization that can be applied to the normative judgments of most people in our society. This reason is because this is necessary to ground a shared concept, and a shared concept is necessary for genuine disagreements.

## Normative judgment not beliefs

We can use the test given above to determine whether normative judgments are world-to-mind or mind-to-world fits. The task is to determine whether a person who judges that they have reason to have some attitude (i.e. pusue, respect, desire, blame, discourage, etc.) with regard to p tends to mantain that attitude upon learning that p is false. It seems clear to me that it does. E.g. if someone judges that they have reason to prevent suffering, they would usually mantain this judgment upon observing that suffering exists. This is generally true for normative judgments. Normative judgments don't play the role of *representing* reality; their purpose is to *guide* behavior in accord with some ideal state of affairs that we endorse.

### Beliefs about the external world

The flaw in belief theories can be seen most clearly seen with analysis that reduce normative judgments to descriptive beliefs about the external world (i.e. as opposed to about introspective mental states, like desires). For example, let's say a theory posited that to judge that one has reason to X is to judge that X produced happiness in others or that it is approved by society. This kind of analysis is clearly inadequate as there are clear cases where agents judge that they have reason to go against what is approved by society or even against what produces happiness. For example, if A judged that X produced happiness and was approved by society (and had any other natural properties), but A proclaimed that he cared nothing for happiness in others or societal approval (or for any of the other properties), and he didn't let these considerations guide his behavior, then we would say that he does not judge that he has reason to X despite his belief that X has those natural properties.

The problem with these sorts of descriptive analyses is that they cannot account for the inherent *motivational* aspect of normative judgments. As mentioned above, normative judgments must be to some degree motivating in order to be explanatory for the behavior of rational creatures. However, a mere belief cannot be motivating without presupposing certain world-to-mind (motivational states) states in the agent. Hume made this point in stating that intentional action reqiures a belief and a desire. At the very least, beliefs cannot motivate on their own without some additional motivational state, where it's a desire or something else. E.g. the fact that X promotes happiness in others, is disapproved by society, violates the categorical imperative, etc. cannot in themselves motivate an agent to action. This will be motivating only if the agent has some motivating state favoring the promotion of those properties.

Consider the following examples:
- An amoralist who agrees that X has naturalistic property N. For any N, he need not be motivated to promote N. Thus, he need not make any normative judgment.
- An alien species that perfectly picks out the referrent of our normative terms and uses them with perfect precision. Again, if they don't have the appropriate motivating attitude, they wouldn't make normative judgments.

??? note "Elaboration Possible"
	Note that the exact same issues applies to non-natural theories.

### Beliefs about desires/attitudes

One might try to avoid this problem by positing that normative judgments are beliefs about one's mental states, e.g. desires. E.g. when someone says that they have reason to X, they are saying that they desire X. This would reduce normative judgments to representations about one's psychology. To analyze this possibility, we first need to analyze what it is to desire something. As mentioned earlier, a desire is a world-to-mind fit which means they have at least a dispositional/functional role: a person who desires G and believes M->G will tend to perform M. The person will also tend to feel delighted at the observation that their desires are actualized. There is also an evaluative component to desires as well: someone who desires p makes an unreflective judgment that they have a reason to promote p (this is unreflective endorsement). So there are three elements: dispositional, sensation and unreflective endorsement. 

There are a few basic problems with these kinds of analyses. They cannot account for the following: (1) The theory cannot explain why agents must take themselves to have reason to adopt the means to satisfy their ends, nor can it explain the structural hierachical nature of normative judgments - where we sometimes judge that a consideration doesn't count as a reason. (2) The theory cannot explain normative-motivational disconnects, when agents judge themselves to have reasons without having a corresponding desire (in the sense of an urge or disposition (and vice-versa). And (3) It cannot account for normative disagreement. Typically if X says act A is wrong and Y says act A is not wrong, this amounts to a disagreement - both parties cannot be correct. However, on this analysis, both parties are by definition correct if they X sincerely desires A not happen whereas Y does desire A to happen. So no disagreement is possible. More elaboration on these issues below.

??? note "Elaboration Possible"
	Extend this to account for beliefs about attitudes in general in addition to desires

??? example "Elaboration"
	These theories cannot account for certain logical constraints we think apply to normative judgments. One example is the requirement that an agent must take himself to have reason to adopt the means to satisfy his ends. Part of what it is to judge that one has reason to judge they have reason to achieve G is to also judge that they have reason to adopt the means to achieve G. But this is not true for beliefs about desires. If one believes that they desire G, they need not also believe that they desire the necessary means for G. For example, somebody might believe that they desire healthy teeth, i.e. they are disposed to seek healthy teeth, they are delighted at the thought of healthy teeth. But they need not also believe that they desire a root-canal even if that is necessary for healthy teeth, i.e. they need not be disposed to seek out the root-canal or be delighted at the idea of a root-canal. 

	Another example is the possibility for structural hierachies with our normative judgments. While the theory can explain how certain pro-tanto reasons are overriden by other reasons (by appealing to conflicting desires which are stronger), they cannot explain the prima-facie structure of reasons, i.e. why a certain reason can be sufficient to make other considerations completely irrelevant. For example, one might judge that the desires they experience in an unsound state of mind are *irrelevant* in providing *any* reason for action. They aren't just overriden by stronger strength; they are eliminated. This elimination cannot be explained on this theory.

	One problem with this analysis is that there are clear cases where a person's beliefs about their desires can deviate from their normative judgments. E.g. it is a coherent question to wonder whether one's desires provide one with reasons for action, i.e. whether they actually endorse the upshots of their desires. As mentioned above, there can be cases of extreme disconnect between a person's desires (and their beliefs about those desires) and their normative judgments. E.g. in cases of physical addiction, psychological compulsion or emotional disturbances, the bulk of a person's strongest desires can be at odds with their normative judgments. Generally speaking, a person's deliberative endorsement need have nothing to do with their dispositions, sensations or unreflective endorsements. It is coherent to not endorse any of those properties under deliberation.

	Reducing normative judgments to beliefs about desires cannot account for common normative disagreement, particularly involving morality. E.g. imagine one party says that the fact that Mexicans are non-white is a reason to restrict Mexican immigration and another party disagrees. Or one party says that the bodily autonomy of a woman is a reason to permit abortions and another party disagrees. These are genuine disagreements of attitudes that cannot both be correct. However, if the theory about beliefs about desires is correct, then the statements here are actually not in conflict. One party is simply saying "I desire X and I desire that you desire X" and another is saying "I desire not-X and I desire that you desire not-X". But nothing about these propositions is inconsistent, even if both parties agree on all of the relevant empirical facts. However, despite these agreements, the parties involved can still disagree about what we have reason to do. We can look at other cases where agents have opposing desires to see that it doesn't seem to create the conflict we find with moral disagreements, e.g. if two people are competing for a prize both parties might believe "I desire X and desire that you desire X" where X is that the prize goes to the respect speaker. However, this would not constitute a disagree as in the moral case. It might be objected that moral desires are characterized by their strength, but we can imagine that the desires involved in the lotery are stronger (in terms of urges/sensations) than common moral desires.

### Beliefs about higher-order desires

One might try to alleviate some of these worries by appealing to higher-order desires. Instead of normative judgments reducing to beliefs about one's desires, they reduce to beliefs about one's higher-order desires. I.e. when someone says that they have a reason to X, they are expressing a belief not that they desire X but that they desire to desire X. It seems that this might be able to account for some issues. One is that it seems to account for some of the logical constraints that apply to normative judgments. In particular, they might be able to account for the hierarchical prima-facie structure of certain normative judgments. When someone judges that a desire doesn't qualify as a reason to consider, that amounts to a desire that the corresponding desire not be actualized. It also may be able to account for some of the disconnects between normative judgments and desires. When there is such a disconnect, e.g. as when not in a sound state of mind, one might have a desire that they not desire to have. This explains how one can have a normative judgment without a corresponding desire (or vice-versa). 

There are a few problems with using higher-order desires to explain the disconnect between normative judgments and desires, and to explain the hierarchical structure of normative judgments. (1) The first is that there seems to be an infinite regress of higher-order desires. We can have second-order desires, third-order desires, etc. but it seems impossible to choose which level should take priority. (2) There doesn't seem to be any non-ad-hoc reason to give special priority to higher-order desires as opposed to desires in general. (3) The theory does nothing to account for normative disagreement. More elaboration on these issues below.

??? example "Elaboration"
	There seems to be an infinite regress of higher-order desires. For example, imagine someone had a desire to start up a conversation with a stranger because they want to engage a relationship. They might also have a second-order desire that they didn't have this desire because they are concerned with how awkward it would be to have such a conversation, and it would be better if they didn't have a desire whose actualization would create unfortunate circumstances. They might also have a third-order desire to not have this second-order desire because they also want to be more risk-taking and they wished they didn't have this risk-adverse disposition. Then they could have a fourth-order desire to not have this third-order desire because being more risk-taking isn't actually something worth doing. This can go on ad infinitum. The question is what level of desires do we express when we make normative judgments. Is it the second- or the third-order? Why? That would seem arbitrary. Is it any higher-order desire? Why? Why are first-order desires excluded then? 

	There doesn't seem to be any non-ad-hoc reason to give special priority to higher-order desires as opposed to desires in general. This seems to be a motivated ad hoc constraint to account for some of the criticisms mentioned above. Indeed, this theory somewhat suggests that priority should simply be given to desires with the strongest "strength". But it is quite possible (and happens rather often) that one's lower-order desires are stronger than their higher-order desires, when "strength" in terms of disposition and sensation. 

	The theory cannot account for normative disagreement, especially moral disagreement. As stated above, if one person believes they have higher-order desire X and another believes they have higher-order desire not-X, these judgments are not in conflict, even assuming both parties are fully informed of the relevant information. Yet people would say that they can have moral disagreements with someone despite agreeing that everyone has certain higher-order desires.

### Beliefs about counterfactual desires/attitudes

Instead of higher-order desires, one might point to counterfactual desires. Rather than *actual* desires or higher-order desires, normative judgments are beliefs about desires that one would have under different circumstances, i.e. under reflection, full information, full experience, under sound state of mind, etc. Note that the characterization of the circumstances would have to be non-normative to avoid circularity. This might be able to account for the disconnect between desires and normative judgments. It also might be able to account for the hierarchical structure of normative judgments, if one's counterfactual desires somehow also demonstrated this hierarchical structure. It might also be able to account for normative disagreements. We can claim that someone else is incorrect about their beliefs about the desires that they would have in counterfactual circumstances, even though we couldn't make the same claim about their actual desires. 

However, it is doubtful just how well this theory accounts for disconnects and disagreement for the following reasons: (1) it still seems that there can be disconnects between a person's beliefs about their idealized desires and their normative judgments. I.e. it is possible for someone to simply not care about the desires they would have in different circumstances, even though it may happen rarely if at all. At the very least, people regularly make normative judgments without explicitly thinking about their counterfactual attitudes in hypothetical circumstances. (2) it seems that there can be cases where a person's idealized desires differ from another person's idealized desires and yet they can still disagree normatively. 

Lastly, even if one can account for these issues, there doesn't seem to be any single principle that unites all of the conditions of the idealized circumstances. Why is it that our normative judgments are judgments concerned with full experience, full information, sound states of mind, full reflection, etc? These all seem like ad hoc conditions to input in the theory to account for some of the criticisms mentioned earlier. 

### General Problems

Some of the problems mentioned thus far:
1. Motivation - the strong, but *defeasible*, connection between normative judgments and motivation.
2. Disagreement - different parties can have conflicting normative attitudes
3. Reasoning - Structural constraints on normative judgments
4. Ubiquity - Generalizability
5. General issues - Unmotivated, ad-hoc, phenomenological issues, ununinified, etc. (for higher-order and counterfactual theories)

All belief-based theories suffer from a few general problems. Two problems are possibly solvable if using a counterfactual-belief theory - the problems of Generalizability and Correctness. The problem of Generalizability concerns the issue of giving a unified account of all normativity, i.e. reasons for actions, desires, and all attitudes. The problem of Correctness is that such a theory seems to force us to accept rather controversial substantive position, on pain of being contradictory otherwise. 

Two other problems are not solvable with any belief theory: (1) the Open Question Argument and (2) the Insistence on Normative Language. The latter two problems show how belief-based theories fail to capture normative language rather than how they fail to capture normative psychology (although counterfactual-belief-based theories do fail to capture normative psychology in their phenomenological implications). (1) The Open Question Argument reveals that naturalistic theories imply that it would be contradictory for someone to make a normative judgment without having the corresponding descriptive judgment. We know that implication is false. Thus, naturalism is false. (2) The Insistence on Normative shows noramtive language has survived in addition to our descriptive language. The fact that it has survived gives some plausibility to the notion that normative language plays a role not captured by descriptive language. Further, it seems most people would agree that we actually have reason to continue to use normative language (even naturalists believe this, who insist on assimilating our normative language into descriptive meanings, rather than abandoning normative language altogether). More elaboration below.

??? example "Elaboration"
	One issue with belief-based theories is that they are not generalizable to all forms of normative judgments. We don't just make judgments about reasons for action. We also make judgments about reasons for belief, reasons to feel fear, amusement, blame, etc. It doesn't seem that when we judge that one of these attitudes are appropriate, that we are just believing that we desire to have these attitudes or that we would have certain attitudes in some far off circumstances. Consider cases when I judge that I have reason to fear a lion but no reason to fear a toy lion, that I have no reason to be angry with a messenger despite my anger, that I have reason to believe the conclusion of a sound argument, that I have no reason to believe in God, etc. This cannot be plausibly reduced to beliefs that we "desire" (or would "desire" in certain counterfactual circumstances) to have a certain attitude or belief. Indeed, I might desire that I believe the opposite of the conclusion of a sound argument or to believe in God, if I thought it would make me happier, say. 

	One might explain this by appealing to counterfactual *attitudes* in general instead of *desires* in particular. So a judgment about reasons for belief would be beliefs about the beliefs one would have if they were fully reflective, in a sound state of mind, etc. However, this is phenomenologically implausible. This seems rather far off from what we are doing when thinking about our reasons for belief. We aren't thinking about our hypothetical counterfactual beliefs. When we are determining whether an argument is reasonable, we are not asking if we would be convinced by the argument in some far off circumstances. We're just deciding if we endorse the conclusion of the argument. We're trying to find an answer to a practical problem, not a theoretical problem about what we might hypothetically do. One might respond to this by claiming that there can be non-trivial non-obvious analytic reductions.

	Another issue is that these theories imply that the standard of correctness for our normative judgments must reduce to the strength of our desires, measured in terms of the strength of the corresponding urge or sensation. However, it seems that priority should be given to certain normative judgments independent of "strength". The problems with this can be found in Normative Correctness.md. A counterfactual-belief theory might be able to account for this, however.

	All of these theories can be rebutted by the Open Question Argument. These theories imply that it would be contradictory for someone to say that they have (or would have) a certain attitude (in circumstances C) with regard to an object but denied that it had the relevant normative property (or vice-versa). But there is clearly no contradiction here. We might disagree with that person, or find their statement queer; but they haven't said anything that was internally inconsistent. Put another way, it would imply that if one person believed that they had (or would have) a certain naturalistic attitude with regard to X (in circumstances C), we could deduce that they also believed X had a relevant normative property (or vice-versa). But clearly we cannot make such a deduction. This is a general problem that all belief-based theories.

	Further, such theories also cannot explain why normative language has survived or should survive. Why is it that people tend to use normative terms in place of descriptive terms when they mean the same thing? More importantly, why should we continue to use normative terms? If this theory is correct, the proponents of the theory can go on to use their descriptive terms without losing any of their meaning. The fact that they refuse to do this and insist on associating our normative terms with these descriptive terms suggests that we recognize a core feature in normative language that we do not recognize in descriptive language. However, *that* core feature explains why normative terms and descriptiev terms cannot mean the same thing.

For these reasons, normative judgments shouldn't be characterized as any form of belief. Instead, normative judgments must express a kind of non-cognitive, non-representation attitude. Normative language plays a *non-cognitive* (rather than merely descriptive) role in discourse. *That* is the core element contained in normative language that is lost when translating to descriptive language. The question is how to characterize the attitudes. Note that this does not deny that some of the attitudes mentioned in belief-based theories are relevant; they are very relevant. But their role in language is different. Instead of being *reported*, they are instead *expressed*. Also, normative language doesn't just *express* attitudes; it also commonly serves to *prescribe* attitudes in others. These two elements - the *expressive* and the *prescriptive* - are the core elements of normative language.

## Normative judgments as non-cognitive attitudes

### Expressive

One aspect of normative judgments is that they express world-to-mind fit attitudes, some of the attitudes associated with the belief-based theories. The difference is that instead of *reporting* those attitudes, normative judgments *express* those attitudes. It's why it would be fair to *infer* (not in the sense of logical inference) that someone has a particular attitude given their normative statements, but we cannot *deduce* their attitudes given such a statement. This is similar to how assertions can *express* a subject's belief even though they do not *report* an agent's beliefs. E.g. if someone says "P is true", it would not be a contradiction for them to say "I do not believe P". This is strange, because the belief is *expressed* but not *reported* by assertions. In the same way, certain attitudes are *expressed* but not *reported* with normative judgments. 

Sometimes, normative statements express straightforwardly ordinary attitudes. For example, if someone says "X is funny", this can commonly be read as expressing an attitude of amusement. When someone says, "good", that can be read as expressing an attitude of desire or approval. Similar considerations can be said about reasons-statements in general, i.e. if someone says there is reason to hold attitude X, this oftentimes simply expresses that the agent holds the attitude in question. Also, instead of straightforwardly expressing an attitude, such normative statements can also express *dispositions* to have certain attitudes. So when someone says that X is wrong, this need not necessarily express the attitude of blame or resentment in that particular moment. Rather, it can express a *tendency* to blame or resent X in normal circumstances.

### Deliberative Endorsement

However, this is not all there is to all normative judgments. There are times when a person judges themselves to have reason to adopt attitude X without actually adopting X (and perhaps even without a tendency to adopt X). Indeed, one can take a step back and question their attitudes at any given moment. It is a common feature of human life that we have attitudes that we renounce, and that we endorse attitudes that we lack. It is common for there to be a disconnect between the attitudes we *actually* hold and the attitudes we think we have *reason to* hold. This suggests that there is a special attitude involved in a normative judgment in favor of X can be distinct from the attitude of holding X itself. This is the attitude of *deliberative endorsement*. This state of mind is essential to normative thinking, and is often what we express with normative statements. 

??? example "Elaboration"
	This attitude is what grounds a common subject matter in all normative concepts. Without this attitude of deliberative endorsement, there would be very little in common involved in judging that a fear, desire, belief, anger, etc. were justified. These would just be expressions of different ordinary attitudes or dispositions. However, what's common to all these judgments (or what can be common) is that the ordinary attitudes can be the object of a single attitude - endorsement. This is not to say that e.g. the psychology of judging that e.g. anger is reasonable is exactly the same as judging that e.g. a belief is reasonable. Clearly they are different - the former expresses (but doesn't *report*) that the agent has disposition to feel anger in the given circumstances and the latter expresses that the agent probably adopts the belief in question. However, the point is that the attitude of deliberative endorsement is an attitude common to both of these judgments.

	This kind of attitude is found only in creatures with higher order thinking (i.e. thoughts about thoughts) as it is an attitude *about* other attitudes; the *object* of the endorsement is one's attitudes. E.g. one endorses or (renounces) their fear, anger, resentment, desires, etc. Because of this, normative judgments of this kind are probably only present in humans (and perhaps some very rare outliers of others species). Whereas an animal acts according to its desires and believes according to its perceptions, humans have the capacity to step back from their desires/perceptions (and attitudes in general) and question whether those initial attitudes constitute reasons for action/belief, and (if the initial attitudes are normatively assessable) whether there is reason to adopt those initial attitudes. 

	There may be a sense in which a person can have unreflective endorsement of their attitudes. For example, if you asked a thoughtless person what they think they should do, they might quickly respond with an action that satisfies their most present desires. They might never actually take a step back and question whether they endorsed their desire or whether they have reason to hold the desire. They might never question *why* they have that desire or what kind of reason they have to pursue the object of that desire. They might never investigate the relevant features of the object of the desire that grounds the reasons. They may never question whether the desire provides them with reason for action. They might never consider how that desire conflicts with other desires that they approve of and what kind of importance or priority the desire should have relative to other reasons he acknowledges. But since they do approve of their desire in a trivial sense, they can be said to endorse their desire in a weak sense. While this oftentimes does happen with normative judgments/statements, this is somewhat similar to the case of a person who expresses straightforwardly non-normative attitudes. This is not the essential feature of normative judgments, which is endorsement after reflection and questioning what one actually takes to be a reason.

### Prescriptive

There is another core element to normative judgments in addition to *expressing* deliberative endorsement. That is their function at *evoking* the attitudes of others. Thus, there is an *expressive* component and a *prescriptive* component to normative judgments. The prescriptive component is particularly strong for moral judgments. When someone judges that X is wrong, they are expressing a lot of attitudes: they endorse not performing X, they endorse blaming anyone who does X, etc. But it also serves to influence the attitudes of others around them; it is using language as a tool to cause others to refrain from doing X, to blame anyone does X, to incite guilt in anyone who does X, etc. This is the second way that non-cognitivism expands the role of normative langauge. The considerations mentioned earlier showed how normative judgments are extended from expressions of mind-to-world state beliefs to expressions of world-to-mind state attitudes. Now, we see how normative language is extended even further, from a tool for *expressing* attitudes to a tool for *inciting* attitudes.

### Benefits

This analysis of normative statements and normative judgments solves the issues that plagued belief-based theories. 

??? example "Elaboration"
	Firstly, unlike some of the simpler belief-based theories, this analysis can account for familiar normative disagreement. The key issue mentioned earlier with belief-based theories was that it seemed that people could have normative disagreements (especially morally) even if all parties agreed on all of the facts about the world. This can be accounted for with a non-cognitive analysis because normative judgments are not beliefs or other mind-to-world state that represent the world. Rather, they are more akin to plans or some other world-to-mind state that consists of how how one orients themselves in the world. So, two people can have conflicting plans (in the sense that they cannot both be *actualized*), which suffices for normative disagreement, even though they might have identical mind-to-world states.

	Secondly, a non-cognitive analysis can be generalized for all normative judgments and statements. As mentioned earlier, there is a core attitude shared among all normative judgments - that is the attitude of deliberative endorsement. Normative concepts differ depending on the object of the endorsement - whether it's a belief, a desire, fear, anger, etc. that is being endorsed. The key element of endorsement is what's shared. 

	This analysis avoids any controversial issues regarding the correctness of normative judgments. The reason is that this analysis mantains that normative of judgments don't purport to correspond to an independent normative realm. Because there is no independent normative realm, it doesn't posit a realm that would be the standard for normative judgments. Thus, normative judgments are not actually true or false on this theory, at least not if "true" and "false" are used in the ordinary sense, which is to say correspondence to some independent reality. It may be possible that there is a kind of "correctness" that we can construct for normative langauge that is distinct from the standard of truth for ordinary descriptive judgments, but non-cognitivism doesn't necessarily have any say on the matter.

	A non-cognitive analysis also escapes the semantic problems that plague belief-based theories. As mentioned earlier, for any belief-based theory that suggest a definitional reduction between normative property M and natural property N, such a theory implies that if a person believes that an object is M, then we can deduce that the person also believed that the object is N (and vice-versa). In other words, we can deduce normative beliefs from factual beliefs (and vice-versa). Non-cognitive analysis does not suffer from same issue. In fact, it *explains* why the disconnect exists in the first place. Because normative judgments express a world-to-mind fit state whereas factual judgments express a mind-to-world fit, non-cognitivism avoids reducing either domain to the other and explains why any system that attempts to do this is doomed to failure. For any proposed naturalistic properties about an attitude, an agent could either endorse or renounce the attitude in question. Thus, the agent could simultaneously judge themselves to have reason to adopt or not adopt the attitude in question, all without betraying incoherence.

	This analysis also explains why normative language is important and inescapable. The reason we still use normative language is because we need to express the attitudes we need to express the world-to-mind fit attitudes that we happen to have. One of the purposes of communications is to allow agents to express their attitudes. Verbal language is one of the many tools to aid in communication (e.g. there's also non-verbal language such as body langauge). All agents must have both mind-to-world fit and world-to-mind fit attitudes. Therefore, there is just as much communicative benefit to expressing world-to-mind fit attitudes as there is for expressing mind-to-world fit attitudes. 

	In fact, the communication of non-cognitive attitudes is arguably even more important. Because humans are natural social animals, our success depends in large part on how we are to coordinate and cooperate with one other. Coordination involves the coordination of attitudes. Such coordination will require some sort of tool to express and modify the attitudes of others. Normative language is one such tool to accomplish this. There are, of course, other ways of achieving this, e.g. sticking a middle finger at someone, frowning to someone, crossing your arms with a certain facial expression, etc. can all express anger. The benefit of using language is that it allows for more fine-grained, clear and precise expressions and modifications of one's attitudes. The precision of language even aids in concept-formation as we learn about what our attitudes actually are. 

	??? question Why there is objective purport? Why not have our language just be "Boo!" and "Yay!"
		- Evolutionary advantages: Objective prescriptions more likely to be adopted by others
		- Subject-verb form statements allow for more precision/clarity. We find it already with phrases like "that's a tasty dish" instead of saying "mmmm"

### Explanatory

In addition to the expressive and prescriptive role of normative language and psychology, there is another role played by normative thinking. The distinction can be brought out by considering two different meanings involved when one agent says that another agent ought to do something. In one case, the speaker could simply be expressing his own attitude with regard to the agent's behavior, or perhaps even trying to manipulate the agent's behavior. The expressive and prescriptive role of normative language has already been mentioned. But there is another sense in which the speaker could be making a claim about what the agent himself would endorse if fully rational. And this need not be purely expressive or prescriptive, because there is a sense in calling something "rational" that does not involve expressing or prescribing any attitudes to others. Rationality in this sense simply refers to an agent's tendency to adopt attitudes that they judge themselves to have reason to adopt (or what they would judge themselves to have reason to adopt in idealized circumstances C that they judge to be relavent), as opposed to having some independent desires that we judge to be virtuous (e.g. kind, caring, etc.). These would be *internal* reasons.

It may not be perfectly clear in all cases whether a judgment is internal or external. When an agent says "A should not X", there are a few possible readings of this:
(1) The speaker expresses endorsement of A doing X, and perhaps endorsements of a norm whereby we disapprove of A for doing X (external reason).
(2) The speaker attempts to invoke a change in A's attitudes such that he refrains from X-ing (external reason).
(3) The speaker explains why A would X if A were fully rational, i.e. if A were to take into considerations that could be justified from his own normative judgments (internal reason).
(4) The speaker provides an optimistic internal reason; they make a statement that was false before they said it, but which becomes true after saying it because A comes to see themselves as having reason to X after the utterance. Technically, this would have been an internal reason all along, because the only way this would motivate A is if A cared about what other people believed to begin with, in which case A did have an internal reason to X.

??? question "Explain Rationality"
	1. Explain the notion of reasons-judgments in the sense of "A has reason to X" = "A would X if A were rational"
	2. Explain the meaning of "rational". It should be understood in a minimal sense, such that an agent is irrational only if they fail to adopt the attitudes that they judge themselves reason to adopt". As short argument might be as follows: "Rationality" plays a role that we need in normative language: to explain standards which are in some sense available from the perspective of the agent in question, not merely from the perspective of the speaker. These are standards that an agent can use to evaluate their own process of reasoning and deliberation. Thus, the standards must come from within the agent himself.

## Language

### Emotive language

Concepts that become used emotively (thick ethical concepts?):
- Man
- Cool
- Real nigga
- racist

Some of these may have descriptive references, but given that they can be used emotively, people can use them in ways independent of their descriptive reference. E.g. A real man provides for his family, there's nothing cool about taking unnecessary blows in a boxing match, a real nigga doesn't go to prison, white nationalist arguing that they aren't racist, etc. These are all normative expressions because they are ignoring the reference of these terms and instead using them as they are useful for expressing certain dynamic content. These are concepts that regulate specific attitudes in that they express them and prescribe them to others. Saying that a real man does X expresses the imperative that man ought to do X. Saying X is cool expresses the imperative that we ought to appreciate and celebrate someone who does X, etc.
