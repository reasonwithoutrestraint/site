# Rational Correctness

The Moral Problem

1. Rational: Moral duties provide agents with reason for action.
2. Categorical: Moral duties apply to all agents (some infer an independence of any agent's desires). 
3. Internalism: Practical reasons are necessarily dependent on desires.
4. Contingency: There are no necessary desires in all rational agents
5. Success Theory: There are moral truths.

## Well-being

How to distinguish well-being (what makes a life go best) from reasons for action/desires? Some differences:

1. X might provide high well-being without an agent having reason to X, e.g. experience machine, animals, etc.
2. It is sensible to ask whether an agent has reason to do something that promotes their well-being due to some other end.

Reasons for action/desire = Reasons an agent has prior to perform an action

## Reasons and rationality

It is a platitude about reasons and rationality that: R is a normative reason for A to X iff R would be a motivating reason for A to X if A were rational and A was aware of R. In other words, reasons are the upshot of full rationality and full information. The question is how to characterize rationality. Internalism gives a *procedural* characterization of rationality that specifies a form of ideal *deliberation*, i.e. of moving from certain motivations to action and other motivations. Externalism specifies an *substantive* characterization of rationality that specifies certain substantive elements like "a motivation to help others", or an agent requires certain experiences or information to actually be rational. I.e. being rational might require being converted than sound reasoning.

The above is true platitude only if we use a fairly broad definition of rationality. But Scanlon narrows rationality to just doing that which you judge yourself to have reason to do. Which means to be irrational is to fail to adopt the attitudes that one judges themselves to have reason to adopt. This makes sense to me. I wouldn't call someone irrational if they failed to do what they would do if they reflected more or were more experienced. "Rationality" as used above seems to simply mean "idealized person".

## Constructivism

Question for Constructivism

1. I understand the argument that there is no normative truth independent of normative judgments (i.e. the metaphysical/epistemological/motivational problems with realism).. But how do we establish that normative truth for a given agent's depends on *that* agent's normative judgments? E.g. why not the normative judgments of the agent's community? Or the normative judgments of the speaker? Why not understood "reasons" broadly as a standard by which to criticize someone, e.g. because people are subject to criticism for being cruel, and because reasons are standards of criticism, why not say cruel people are unreasonable? There are infinitely many possible theories of normative truth that don't reduce normative truth for A to A's normative judgments, without also having the metaphysical/epistemological problems of realism. A motivational argument can be given perhaps. Kosgaard's states that such an account is the only thing that can explain the normative authority of deliberation for agents. What does this mean?
	- We can understand "should" claims as general standards to ground criticism, e.g. people "should" not act immorally, even though they may have no reason not to do so.
	- "Reasons" may be sometimes used in this broad sense, but for clarity this concept will be identified with the narrow sense (connected with an agent's normative judgments) leaving "should" the job of handling general grounds for criticism. 
2. What is the general strategy for determining what is constitutive of a given activity?
3. What are the procedures for ideal deliberation?
4. Why do some attitudes have higher authority over others, i.e. the attitude that values the upshot of idealized reflection are more important than an agent's present desires.
5. How do unreflective desires provide reasons?

Three categories of normative judgments

1. Constituitive: normative judgments held by all agents insofar as they are rational 
2. Internal: normative judgments held by a particular agent, i.e. narrow use of "reason". Or what is entailed from an agent's normative judgments. 
3. External: grounds for criticizing an agent, i.e. broad use of "should"

The question is why does the internal/external divide matter and why do internal reasons count as real reasons?

The answer is this: There is a sense of reasons such that if an agent fails to do what *he judges* to be a reason R, then he is irrational. But this can be true only if the agent judges R to be an internal reason. I.e. if an agent fails to do what he *endorses* (i.e. an internal reason judgment), then he is irrational. But if he fails to do what he judges to be endorsed from some other perspective (which would be an external reason judgment), e.g. the moral perspective, then he is not being irrational. So reasons in the sense of being connected with rationality or irrationality must be internal. The property of *being a reason* is a status we confer give to considerations that we endorse upon deliberation. 

The question now is why assume rationality cannot be broadened to include substantive normative judgments, so that someone who fails to respond to e.g. moral reasons are irrationality beause rationality requires being moral?

Some Arguments

1. Little ontological baggage.
2. Allows for a credible epistemology.
3. Explains many constituitive properties of certain normative domains.
4. Explains existence internalism (assuming we accept judgment internalism).
5. Doesn't seem like reasons can be discarded as meaningless. One can't ask "why be rational".

See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street, (Bernard Williams?)

The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself. 

A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of *cannot* is not rational, but what is *constituitive* of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.

### Alternative conceptions of truth

There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:

- Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal judgments:
- Probabilistic judgments:
- Causal judgments:
- Counterfactual judgments: 

Rational Judgments

- Epistemic Rationality: 
- Prudential Rationality: 
- Moral Rationality: 

Under constructivism, for normative judgments, truth is not based on some correspondence to some mind-independent normative reality. There is no standard of correctness for normative judgments independent of what we ourselves decide to be valuable. There is no sense in determining that someone has a reason to do something if it cannot be inferred from what they actually judge themselves to have reason to do.

#### Quasi-truth-apt

If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.

### Constituitive Features

The central question is how to determine what requirements are constitutive of a type of behavior. One candidate is this: a requirement is constituitive of a behavior if no agent could consciously reject the requirement in full awareness.

Logical Consistency. One basic constituitive feature of normative judgments (and thuoghts generally) is logical consistency. No person can consciously believe X and believe not-X in full awareness.

#### General

1. Consistency: Consistent/Coherent norms trump inconsistent/incoherent norms (This is required for all other constituive features to have force). 
2. Soundness: Norms endorsed under a sound state of mind trump norms endorsed under psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc.
3. Deliberation: Norms endorsed under deliberation trump unreflective dispositions that we discard under deliberation.
4. Experience: Norms that maintain endorsement upon experiencing their outcome trump ends which are not.
5. Full Information: Norms endorsed with full information trump norms based on false beliefs?

#### Epistemic

- Perceptions/memories: the reason that a perception that p provides one with reason to believe that p is because part of what it is to perceive p is to acquire an unreflective belief that p. If perceptions didn't provide one with an unreflective belief that p, then perceiving that p would be like imagining that p, and this would not provide one with a reason to believe p. Similar considerations apply to memories.
- Abduction:  
- Induction: 
- Causation: 

#### Prudential

Constructivism provides an easy explanation of the following norms of practical reasoning.

Constitutive Features

1. End-Satisfaction: agents have reason to satisfy their ends.
2. Instrumental: agents have reason to adopt the means to satisfy their ends.
3. Time: agents have reason to satisfy the goals of their future self. 
	Agents justified in criticizing the goals of our past selves.

Other Features. May not be constitutive (?), but depend on features implicit in most people

4. Conflict: how to deal with conflicting goals? 
	Is there a goal hierarchy? 
	Ends constitutive of one's identity (i.e. valuing reflection) trump conflicting ends.  
5. Feasibility: goals which are more likely to be satisfied trump equivalent goals that cannot be satisfied.
6. Pain/Suffering: pain/suffering provides one with reason to avoid it is precisely because people judge that they have reason to avoid it (or they have an unreflective aversion towards it). 
	If a person had no (un)reflective aversion toward pain, then there would be no actual reason to avoid it. 
	It is not the pure sensation of pain that provides us with reason to avoid it. 
7. Desires: a desire to X tends to provide one with reason to X because 
	- people tend to judge that they have reason to X if they desire to X, and 
	- all intentional actions are done because of some desire; otherwise, they would be involuntary actions.

## Existence Internalism

Existence internalism accepts the connection between rationality and reasons. But it characterizes rationality without explicitly requiring any particular motivations. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of ideal deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of sound, ideal deliberation. In other wrods, normative reasons are the rational extension of one's motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is a sound deliberative route from an agent's motivational reasons to C. 

General strategy for internalism
- Connect normative reasons and motivating reasons via a procedural account of rationality.
	- Connect normative reasons with rationality.
	- Connect rationality with deliberation and/or some other non-substantive constraints (e.g. full information, full experience, etc.). 
	- The key is that the procedural account of rationality ensures that reasons are not "cut off" from agents with an ideal procedure. I.e. the validity of the procedure can be demonstrated to the agent without presupposing substantive normative asssumptions.
	- Note that this is still broader than Scanlon's use of rationality.
- Disconnect external reasons with motivating reasons.

### Motivational Argument 1

One argument for internal reasons states that reasons must be capable of motivating action.

Note: 
- R is characterized as propositions.
- A motivational set is merely a set of dispositions towards behaviors under certain beliefs.

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A were fully rational.
2. A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.
4. Therefore there are no external reasons.

The central question here is (2). (1) and (3) are both a priori, conceptual truths. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements, so may seem to be question-begging. We need to give an independent argument for (2), in a way that explains how to pick out which dispositions provide reasons.

Modifications:
- "Fully Rational" may need to be explicitly characterized in terms of "ideal sound deliberation" or something more specific, so that (2) is not seen as question-begging against the (rare) externalist who says that full rationality might endorse behaviors for A that A has no dispositions to do. 

#### Procedural rationality

This is to support (2) of the explanatory argument: A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements. We need an independent argument for procedural rationality to support (2). And we also need to explain why it's not just any ol' dispositions that are needed to supply an agent with reasons for action, i.e. an agent might have a disposition to overvalue short-term gains at the expense of long-term losses, but this *mere* disposition is not what grounds any reasons to value short-term gains as one might think from (2). Instead, what matters is what dispositions that agent actually endorses under deliberation. But now we seem to be making the deliberative argument below:

### Motivational Argument 2

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A deliberated soundly.
2. A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation only if A is disposed to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.
4. Therefore there are no external reasons.

"Ideal" must not require specific elements in one's motivational set. Otherwise, it would be externalist, as it would be substantive rather than procedural.

Also, (1) needs to be argued for, as it is no longer merely a plattitude. It almost may seem to be question-begging against the externalist. We might be able to accept (1) if we accepted constructivism. Normative truth derives from the normative judgments an agent makes, and it is constituitive of agency to value one's motivations under deliberation. So we just need to argue for constructivism.

### Explanatory Argument

Normative reasons are counterfactual explanatory reasons (Michael Smith w/out ideal observer).

1. R is a reason for A to X only if R could explain why A would X under sound, ideal deliberation.
2. That A is motivated to X by believing R can be explained only by something in A’s desires, goals, etc. favoring doing X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in A’s desires, goals, etc. that motivate a sound, deliberative A to X by believing R.
4. Therefore there are no external reasons.

Note we have (1) which is not a plattitude which one might object to. However an argument for (1) might be: (1) should be accepted by considering the cases where we perform actions because of normative reasons. The times where there is a disconnect between our motivating and normative reasons, we can point to some sort of problem, either we aren't aware of the reasons, we have false information, we suffer from addition, etc. 

The reason that reasons statements are not based on the hypothetical motivational sets of e.g. a fully moral A, i.e. A+, is because it is important that reasons statements apply directly to A. Note, however, that we can still focus on the somewhat idealized A who has deliberated, because we can infer that A already values the motivations of himself after he has deliberated. We can infer this from the fact that he is in fact deliberating. So he already values his deliberation.

But why should reasons statements for A be based on what he actually values in any present moment? This seems question-begging against the externalist. Two reasons (1) We make claims about reasons" for the purpose of influencing, motivating, or guiding agents. But the only thing that can guide agents (assuming they don't suffer from addictions, false beliefs, etc.) are elements from their motivational set. And (2) this is a basic premise of constructivism (see below).

### Constructivist Argument

Constructivism + Judgment Internalism = Existence Internalism

1. Constructivism: A has a reason to X only if A's normative judgments in some sense endorse X-ing.
2. Judgment Internalism: A's normative judgments endorse X-ing only if A has some motivation to X.
3. Existence Internalism: A has a reason to X only if A has some motivation to X.

Constructivism is actually a narrow form of existence internalism if we accept judgment internalism and if we believe one can have motivating reasons without judging them to be normative reasons. In that case, the motivating reasons corresponding to one's normative judgments would be a strict subset of their motivational set.

## Competing Theories

### Humean Model

The Humean theory of rationality states the following

A has a reason to X if and only if (1) X promotes A's desire d and (2) d is not based on any false beliefs. This can be simplified to: A has a reason to X if and only if X promotes a foundational (rather than derivative) desire in A. Desires are then the upshot of the following 

- Full information
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).

Desires can be given three components:
* A certain positive or negative sensation
* A disposition to promote some state of affairs
* An unreflective normative judgment that one has reason to promote a state of affairs

Not clear if an "urge" can be reduced to a sensation/disposition pair.

#### Problems

These are problems insofar as desires are divorced from normative judgments (e.g. plans, goals, etc.).

* Normativity of desires: Why would a desire, in terms of just sensations and dispositions, provide someone with reasons for action? Imagine someone had a disposition where they just felt the urge to turn on radios whenever they saw one but they didn't think they had any reason to do so. Imagine A is injected with a drug that makes him crave the drug much more, and this is his strongest desire by far. Does he have most reason to take the drug?
* Disconnects: Assume the normativity of desires are accounted for. How to account for disconnects between an agent's reasons and their desires? e.g. weakness of will (no desires created given reasons) and addiction (no reasons come from desires).
* Priority: Assume the disconnect between reasons and desires is accounted for (perhaps by looking at a mode of desires). On this model, the authority of desires are simply based on their "strength". 
	- How does this account for the authority we want to give to categorically superior desires? E.g. the priority of higher-order desires or desires under full experience, reflection, sound state of mind, etc. which may have low strength? 
	- How can we ground criticisms of fully informed desires that are based on inexperience, lack of reflection, unsound, etc.?
* Prudence: Why agents have reason to satisfy the desires of their future self?

See general problems below

### Dispositionalism / Sophisticated Humean Model

The idealization for discovering reasons requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end-deliberation. Some other possibilities include. We can supplement the Humean model by incorportating other requirements:

- Fully Informed
- Correct means-end deliberation.
- Reflection - desires endorsed under reflection have priority over others
	- Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
	- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Soundness - free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Fully Experienced - not merely knowledge of a proposition p, but exposure to a stimuli (i.e. a perception, an argument, etc.) that provokes the attitude.
- Systematically unified desires.
- Concern with one's future experiences.

Reasons = Full Experience + Full Information + Full Reflection + Sound mental state + ... 

At bottom, the concern is that we are starting with an agent's given motivational set and find a sound deliberative route or procedure with the aforemention properties to discover reasons.

#### Problems

Hasn't solved the following problems from above:

- Normativity of desires: why do mere sensations/dispositions, in the absence of a normative judgment, provide a reason for action?

It doesn't seem that they do. Instead, we should focus on (1) the normative judgments an agent would make (e.g. their plans, goals), under (2) certain idealized conditions - full information, reflection, soundness, experience, etc.

#### Evaluating underived desires

Some theories allow the creation/destruction of underived desires. Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one's interests at the expense of others) are irrational.

This is because some theories are "fully rational", not merely fully informed, where "fully rational" extends beyond correct ends-means deliberation. This is necessary to handle irrational desires. Otherwise, it would not be able to account for degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on one's hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would be against coming into contact with germs because of an intrinsic disgust reaction, and they would think, all things else considered, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires.

Now, imagine that if a person were presented with Black crime or IQ statistics. Now, whenver they encountered a Black person, they have a natural, underived fear reaction and they are always thinking about the IQ that the person has. And when they do come across a low IQ Black person, they didn't notice the low IQ before, but now uncontrollably think of IQ when they see Blacks and so they make a note of his low IQ. This feeds into a cycle of implicit bias preventing them from feeling comfortable around minorities. They might try to suppress the reactions as best they could but they can't help themselves. The fact that full information would produce certain responses in people doesn't make those responses rational.

#### Superset of constructivism

Constructivism seems to be a subset of dispositionalism. Consider a case where dispositionalism (but not constructivism) would say someone has reason:

E.g. if they *would* find K to be desirable/humorous if they were exposed to it (thus a reason under dispositionalism), even though they don't *currently* find it desirable/humorous despite knowing that they would if they were exposed to it (thus not a reason under constructivism). 

Constructivism maybe can account for this reason by claiming that it is constituitive of reasons for desire that one judge themselves to have reason to find X valuable if they believed that would find X valuable upon exposure.

Also, See general problems below

### Ideal Observer

See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith

There are two versions: *Ideal agent*: an agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of themselves, A+, would desire to X in C. *Ideal Observer*: an ideal agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. 

*Observer-based not agent-based.* The reasons that X has reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X, not whether A+ would desire X. This is because doing otherwise cannot account for reasons under uncertainty. Consider the case when one has reason to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though they have reason to do so.

It's not clear why this means we should focus on observers rather than agents. For example, imagine the case where someone drinks a glass of soda that they believe to be water and they desire to drink water. We can easily say that they have reason to not drink from the glass, even though they do have reason to drink from the glass given the information that they have. In this case, there is no problem with saying someone has most reason to do something which they have no rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs. Likewise, it seems we can say that people don't actually have reason to seek information, but rather they have reason to seek information given their currently held beliefs. There is no problem with saying, for example, that someone lost in the woods has most reason to take route X, even though this is not something which they have a rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs.

#### Problems 

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do? What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis... This, combined with the earlier notes on ideal observer, might be enough to ignore the observer aspect and focus on the agent. We can distinguish what to do under uncertainty versus full information by distinguishing rationality and reasons.
- ~~~They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.~~~ Actually, this can account for rationality in general. The full information requirement is not to account for *rationality*, but to account for *reasons*. It is full information + rationality that provides reasons. The account of rationality is independent from full information, and this account can be extended to other domains.

See general problems below

### General Problems

General problems with desire accounts

1. The elements posited as providing reasons (desires, informed desires, motivations, ideal desires, ideal observer's desires, etc.) don't necessarily provide reasons, i.e. when they disconnect with an agent's normative judgments.
2. Insofar as they do provide reasons, constructivism explains why they provide reasons, why they matter and a unifying theme explaining the authority of the elements that do matter. E.g. if certain features are constituitive of agency, caring about desires under experience, future desires, etc.
3. Constructivism is the only theory that can give a general account of all reasons.
