`Questions`

1. What does objectivity mean?
2. Why does objectivity matter?
3. When, if ever, can normativity/morality be objective?

Some features that might distinguish moral norms from other normative norms:

1. Moral norms = reasons for action with some interpersonal/social constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief).
    - Moral norms = individual practical reasons that everyone has.
    - Moral norms = reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness equally.
    - Moral norms = norms no one could reasonably reject if they were motivated to find norms to regulate cooperation. Agent A can reasonably reject norm N if A's decreased individual goodness from N is more important than others' increased individual goodness.
2. Norms for the appropriateness of distinctively moral attitudes (e.g. blame, shame, guilt, praise, etc.).
    - Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
    - Moral attitudes are particular evaluative attitudes with constitutive features.
        - Only directed at the features of an agent's character, not necessarily the effect of their actions.
        - A blames B if B's behavior impaired their relationship and A modifies his attitudes toward B. 
    - Moral attitudes are sanctions/rewards for modifying social behavior.
3. Norms for constructed kinds of relationships
    - To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
    - This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

Some notes on features of moral judgments:

1. What determines the content of the norms? Consequentialist or deontologist? If consequences, what consequences?
2. What determines the appropriateness of blame/praise in enforcing a norm in a particular circumstance? Is it based on whether the application is beneficial (consequentialist), or whether the agent deserves the blame/praise (deontological)?
3. The many functions of moral judgments:
    - Expressing the speaker's sentiments. E.g. express blame.
    - Modify the sentiments of the object of the judgment. E.g. invoke guilt.
    - Modify the sentiments of the broader society. E.g. invoke blame among society, both toward the particular agent and toward the relevant behavior in general.

Some analysis:

1. Morality is a system of norms administering blame/guilt. X is morally wrong = it is rational to blame one for doing X and it is rational to feel guilty for doing X.
2. Morality is a system of norms promoting social rationality - what actions would be rational when considering as equals the interests of all affected parties.
3. Moral properties are the natural facts that track and guide our use of moral concepts.
4. Morality is a system of norms that no one could rationally reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation.
5. Moral truth consist in what an idealized otherwise normal agent would morally endorse. 
6. Morality follows from pure rationality
    - Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
    - There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals, metaphysical egoism is false.

Three components of an non-cognitivist moral theory:

1. The functional role of moral judgments is not ascriptive, but is primarily expressive and prescriptive. This is the source of the evolutionary significance. It's mainly focused on the prescriptive aspect than the expressive. Expressive judgments characterize aesthetics, and the distinguishing feature of morality is that they are concerned with modifying the behavior of others. The prescriptive components explains how moral judgments intend to prescribe behaviors to be performed by others.
2. Moral judgments not only prescribe the actions which they favor, but they also prescribe blame/shame/resentment/disapproval from society to any agent that violates the moral judgment. These are the mechanisms by which moral norms are enforced. Someone who did not think it appropriate to blame/shame/resent/disapprove someone who did X could not be interpreted as judging X to be morally wrong.
3. Insofar as moral judgments are expressive of sentimental attitudes (think: X is disgusting!), they can have standards of correctness to determine whether one has reason to hold the attitude in question. This works the same as standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments in general, and for reasons in general (e.g. perhaps by appealing to the refined attitudes that would be had by the speaker if he were more informed and idealized). There no objective standards on this form of moral judgment, as there are no objective standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments. Insofar as it is prescriptive to others ("Don't do X" or "shame the behavior of X"), the standards of correctness reduce to the reasons that other agents have to obey the prescriptions, i.e. to refrain from doing X or to shaming the doing of X. These would have to be not just reasons as such, but reasons contingent upon a goal of establishing a system of norms to coordinate the behavior of others in society. This would be objective standards of correctness for this form of moral judgments, as there is a fixed goal the promotion of which has objective right answers. Without this fix, we wouldn't have an objective standard of correctness and we would all have different reasons.

- Note that this theory is somewhat agnostic about the following two concerns:
    - Whether "X is immoral" merely expresses a non-cognitive/prescription, or whether it also express a judgment (which is potentially a belief) that others have reasons to act as prescribed. This analysis takes the non-cognitive approach but is not too conflicting with the revisionary (potentiall cognitive) approach. 
    - The analysis of reasons and normativity generally. One could take a non-cognitvist, error-theory, naturalist or non-naturalist account of reasons/normativity generally.

Note on the theory that reduces moral judgments to tools for modifying behavior rather than ascriptions that attribute characteristics to persons/actions:

- Moral reasons become actual prudential reasons contingent upon an agent taking into account the interests of others.
- This makes blaming/shaming a tool rather than evaluation. Thus, they would be appropriate insofar as the agent in question could be motivated by the attitudes. This may seem to focus too much on the utility of blame/shame at the expense of whether blame/shame is truly *appropriate* (i.e. whether the blame is warranted or deserved). However, it seems that we already have an intuition that blame is only warranted/deserved when an agent could be motivated by the considerations prompting the blame. For example, you wouldn't blame animals, children, aliens or bonified human enemies. Not only does blame seem inappropriate in those cases, it also doesn't seem that the concept of warranted/deserved blame applies in those circumstances. Blame/shame is reserved for persons who have already implicitly agreed to coordinate with us and take into account our interests. The same goes for social approval/disapproval generally.
- Rational requirements are not binding for all agents. They are binding only for *rational* agents. Likewise, moral requirements are not binding for all agents or all rational agents. They are binding only for *moral* agents, i.e. those who happen to already take an interest in the coordination/cooperation involved in fitting with society.

Aesthetic morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating actions generally. 
- Judgments can be given either a constitutivist or dispositionalist analysis, found in all human cultures/societies.
- The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise. 
- On one reading, the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent). Thus, this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). Probably in line with the constitutivist analysis. This may be relative to contingent sensibilities.
- On another reading, these emotions have no constitutive meaning per se. They are mere tools to regulate society. As such, these emotions are warranted insofar as they promote the good of society (just as with individual rationality), i.e. positive states of consciousness, etc. The good of society should also be constrained in some way by consideration of the interests the agents who are issued duties, for it is assumed that all agents have reason to be moral.
- Sits somewhere between ettiquette and objective morality below, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette. 
- If a moral statement is true in this sense for a person, then they would be motivated to respect its law if they were informed/rational.

Justice morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as aesthetic morality.
- Judgments can be given a constructivist analysis, not necessarily found in all human cultures/societies.
- The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). 
- This is objective and universal across all rational beings, even those lacking our particular emotions of blame/praise, even those lacking consciousness or an experience of well-being. So a group of rational beings may have no basis for morality in the aesthetic sense, yet they would have it in this justice sense.
- This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority. 
- Moral statements might be true in this sense, but a person need not have any motivation or even reason to respect its law in any particular circumstances (even if they were fully informed/rational). They would have a reason, rather, to support the construction of rules which society agrees to respect.

[Ettiquette (aesthetics)] <----> [Optional Morality (aesthetics; justifies praise/blame)] <----> [Forceful Morality (justifies law & force)]

Three types of norms regulating behavior:

1. Ettiquette - violations call for irritation
2. Morality - violations call for shame
3. Justice - violations call for force

Three types of reasons in favor of a norm:

1. Private consequentialist: Consequentialist reason to follow the norm; depends on personal interests that would be promoted by the individual following the norm. 
2. Private constitutive: Constitutive reason to follow the norm (i.g. "right" kind of reason); depends on personal, contingent sentiments, etc. a la secondary qualities. I think describes ettiquette, morality and aesthetics. If true reasons, people will be motivated to respect it in particular circumstances.
3. Public constructive: Reason to support societal construction of the norm; depends on desire to live in a certain sort of society with certain accepted rules. Can apply to people regardless of personal sentiments. I think describes forceful morality (i.e. justice, law) and possibly aeshtetic morality and ettiquette. People might not be motivated to respect it in any particular circumstance, but they will be motivated to support it as a rule that society agrees to respect.

On this understanding, we can still call animal cruelty wrong on the basis of aesthetic moral sentiments of normal humans. But could we be justified in using force to stop animal cruelty? Can aesthetic moral sentiments justify imposing force on others? Or can there be a constructive reason to enact norms to protect animal cruelty? In general, how can we support using force to stop the harm of individuals (animals or humans) outside of our social contract? This does afford the libertarian protective rights for people in society (as is desired), but it does not provide even minimum rights for people outside of society, i.e. it never justifies us to use force to stop them from being harmed.
