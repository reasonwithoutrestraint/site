# Moral Psychology

## Psychology

### Types of psychological states

(1) Beliefs - mind to world
(2) Attitudes - world to mind

### Disagreement in belief/attitude

(1) A & B disagree in belief if both A's and B's belief cannot be true
(2) A & B disagree in attitude if both A's and B's attitudes cannot be satisfied

Distinction between disagreement in attitudes versus disagreement in beliefs about attitudes.

## Language

### Using language to express and shape psychological states

Some uses of language

(1) Express beliefs
(2) Evoke/shape beliefs
(3) Express attitudes (not report)
(4) Evoke/shapes attitudes

Ways to communicate attitudes
1. Descriptive (precludes disagreement)
	- Reporting the attitude (e.g. "X seems yellow")
	- Reporting how certain people are disposed to have the attitude in certain conditions (e.g. "X is yellow because it would seem yellow to normal humans").
2. Direct Expressive (too simple)
	- Expressing the attitude (expressing the seemingness of yellow)
	- Expressing a disposition to have the attitude
3. Higher Order Expressive
	- Expressing a judgment that a certain attitude is appropriate. (sensibility theory, compatible with cognitivism or non-cognitivism).
	- *That* judgment would itself be an attitude. I.e. expressing a pro-attitude towards a certain attitude being had in response to a certain stimuli.
Expressing vs Reporting an attitude.

Examples

Necessity of shaping attitudes/beliefs

(1) Evolutionary need (see: Gibbard)
(2) Modern need

### Subconscious versus conscious uses of language 

### Dynamic and descriptive meaning

Linguistic devicds are tools for communicating psychological states of mind. The meaning of a term is its general *disposition* to express/evoke certain beliefs/attitudes, under the appropriate historical/societal context.

This can constitute the meaning of a term. 

## Moral judgments constituted by attitudes

### Moral judgments often consist of attitudes

0. Which attitudes?
1. Normative education/expressions
2. Flexibility of language
3. Descriptivism unnecessary

### Moral judgments always consist primarily of attitudes

1. Sincerity: Descriptivism cannot account discern "positive" versus "descriptive" uses of normative terms.
2. Ethical Disagreement: Attitudes are the primary driver of ethical disagreement.
3. Ethical Judgments: A person holds a moral judgment if and only if they hold the appropriate attitude.
