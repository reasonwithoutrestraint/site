# Political Philosophy

The Libertarian project:
1. Some moral principle (i.e. Kantian treating everyone as an end)
2. A justification for that principle, i.e. reflective equilibrium or non-contradiction
3. Explain how self-ownership is derived
4. Explain how a theory of property rights is derived, why is the Lockean proviso justified?

Questions
1. Relationship bewteen morality and political legitimacy
2. Justified uses of coercion
3. Why geographic scope is relevant (i.e. poor Africans have less right to our resources than poor Americans). 
4. Justifying the state without positive rights.
5. Different levels of coercion: physical coercion, property redistribution, etc.
6. Account for dire circumstances

Prerequisites for coercion to be justified:
- It has to be done to protect someone else from being coerced (either by an agent or non-agent)

Tentative Axioms
- Anarchy is justified on a global scale.
- In a world of maximum positive liberty and information/rationality, coercion never just (even if to prevent harm).
- People can protect their positive liberty using mimimal coercion necessary.

## Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:

- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.
- It would not be immoral for A to steal from B if it required saving A's life, but B should the right to refuse.
- It would be immoral for B to stop A from getting A's money to save his life, but A should not have that right.

Rights may not be the best way to look at this. Some governmental decisions are justified because of conditions C, but that doesn't justify individuals having the right to that some decision.
- E.g. It is justified to tax the rich to fund the education of the poor, but the poor cannot steal from the rich to fund their own education.
- You might say: this is because of the negative effects of allowing the latter moral principle to govern society, i.e. we would be afraid of being robbed spontaneously, unlike the government which is transparent and predictable.
	- But even if the stealing was transparent and predictable (i.e. say, the church was doing the stealing, and they had their own constitution), it would still be wrong.


## Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

- Joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 
- Equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources.
	- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.
- Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.
- Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.
- Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 
	- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.
- Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

## My Theory

### Equal Share Libertarianism

Note: might wanna change "values/interests" to "material opportunity". Because:
1. cases of compensation are not focused per se on increasing the welfare of the agents, but on compensating for their lost negative liberty; 
2. people are free to form more substantive communal laws not because this necessarily increases their welfare, but because not allowing them to do that (and forcing them to live in a libertarian society) deprives them of some negative liberty.

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property). 
Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. 
I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. 
Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. 
There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. 
This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

### Equal Share + Communal Property

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. 
If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 

Note that "local community" means "more local than the global community", so a country counts as a "local community".

1. Rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required in a local community when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others *actually attempt to*, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. 
	- Examples of those forced to compensate
		- Monopolies that own all the resources. Individual companies physically hogging resources.
		- Economic societies as a whole that materially value only certain traits, e.g. certain cognitive ability (under capitalism), certain race (under racist capatilistic society), etc.; people without these characteristics cannot have a decent life. People who benefit from a system must compensate those who were harmed by the system.
	- Examples of compensation
		- Redistribution
		- Safety nets: disability, unemployment
		- Anti-discrimination laws
2. Some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). 
	- Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which:
		- (a) the extent to which there is agreement in values within the community
		- (b) people are free to exit the community, 
		- (c) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and 
		- (d) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the liberty of those in the community.
		- (e) it is infeasible achieve the same effect by enforcing laws on a smaller scale.
	- These are optional, democratic choices from local communities for a way of life. These are almost always justified by enacting minor confiscation of the property of others (i.e. taxation, regulation, etc.) in order to prevent significant, material harms to others (i.e. assault, sickness, death, un-education,  etc.). 
		- Borders/Military
		- Police
		- Courts
		- Firefighting 
		- Education
		- Food/drug regulation
		- Certain anti-discrimination laws (if the harm is material disadvantage, not psychological pain of seeing racism).
		- Healthcare
	- This is necessary to justify the state, which is a non-consensual use of force against fully informed, fully rational agents that is not based on rectification/compensation. Other libertarian arguments cannot do this.
		- *Right to avoid risk*. People have a right to avoid risky situations. Anyone who refrains from supporting a state commits a rights violations as this would make life risky for everyone else. Therefore, a state is justified to prevent rights violations against those who refuse to support it. 
			- Counter: This is a bad argument because we have a negative right to avoid threats that are direct and immediate and so we can coerce anyone who makes such threats insofar as they advance such threats. But this doesn't justify coercing taxpayers to support a state because they need not to have violating anyone's rights violations.
		- *Right to law.* People have a right to have their right to liberty, life, etc. codified in a body of law. But why though?
		- *Samariton rights*. People have a right to violate others' right to property when doing so is needed to escape dire circumstances. E.g. someone lost in a snow blizzard has a right to break into someone else's cabin to save themselves. This may be valid, but it invokes positive rights which is not in the spirit of libertarianism. 
			- This, however, may be prferrable because it can justify, e.g., a police force even when the majority of people do not consent to it under a democratic system. There is guaranteed harm in the state of nature. It would lead to widespread rights violations to people. There are two points needed to support this: 
				1. People have a right to pre-emptively use force to protect themselves from these probable future rights violations by specific individual.
				2. People have a right to pre-emptively use force to protect themselves from probable future rights violations by a general group even if we don't know which specific individuals in the group will perform the rights violations. This can guarantee the following protection regardless of democratic agreements (1) Borders/Military, (2) Police, and (3) Courts. Two questions
					1. If taxpayers have a positive duty to protect individuals' negative liberty, why don't they also have a positive duty to protect individuals' postive liberty? It seems that whether someone is harmed because of another agent versus a non-agent has no implication on the relationship between taxpayers and the victims. This may justify Firefighters, healthcare, etc. 
					2. Why doesn't this extend across the entire planet? For example, we don't have a duty to protect those in Africa from rights violations. Maybe this: people have the right to use the minimal force necessary to protect themselves from rights violations.

### Disagreement

Broader laws are mandatory, non-negotiable. Local laws are decided democratically. Note also that the broader laws tend to be more libertarian whereas the local laws have the potential to be more authoritarian. In principle, the broader laws could be more authoritarian in different countries where there is homogenous culture where everyone agrees to some authoritarian rules. 

Perhaps, the ideal laws for a given region are simply the upshot of norms of the culture of that region. For homogenous societies, they are free to enforce whatever rules they prefer. However, when a region has a large diversity of opinion, then the range of acceptable laws narrows. The ideal laws for a region are the laws that it would be rational for that region to accept. However, if the views of a region are so diverse, then the only laws that it would be rational for a region to accept would be minimal libertarian laws that emphasized freedom and liberty. Laws regulating international affairs are the extreme of this: the only international laws there are are basic respect for the sovereignty of nations, protection from genocide, etc.

Coercive laws for members of group G are justified if and only if such laws would be approved of by fully informed and fully rational members of group G assuming they sought coercive laws to regulate behavior. A law is appropriate for group G only if it is the upshot of ideal social construction. When there is broad disagreement, the only laws that overlap with everyone's fully rational interest would be minimal libertarian laws.

Must explain the relationship between disagreement and ideal socially constructed norms in a way that explains:
1. That widespread disagreement implies that minarchism.
2. That minimal, but existent, disagreement does not imply minarchism.

### Layers of force

Remember the types of force that can be justified
- Consent: Explicit/Implicit Consent
- Impairment: Lack of rationality/information
- Rectification: Compensation for past physical damages and/or excess resource usage
- Protection: Protection against current physical coercion and/or excess resource usage
- Pre-emptive Protection: Protection against future physical coercion and/or excess resource usage
- Democracy: Optional democratic communal laws 

Here are the types of force that can be justified in reality as it actually is.

Global
- Basically anarchism.
- Respect for the sovereignty of other countries.
- Retaliation against those that violate the sovereignty.
Diverse community (e.g. U.S.). All above plus
- Minarchism
- Military
- Courts for federal laws
- Police to enforce federal laws
- Food/drug regulation
- Compensation for monopolies
	- Redistribution
- Compensation for societal disadvantage
	- Safety nets: low cognitive functioning, disability, unemployment
	- Anti-discrimination laws
Homogeneous community (e.g. US state/city or European countries). Any of these could be valued (could even be minarchist). All above plus
- Courts for local laws
- Police to enforce local laws
- Firefighters
- Education
- Healthcare

### Particulars

List of particular instances of coercion by the state. To give a large dataset for reflective equilibrium

Principles that picks which government behaviors below are justified.

NEW TERM: rights frustration: include rights violations, also includes rights "violation" by a non-agent (i.e. bear attack)

A governmental policy P that reduces the freedom of group X to benefit individuals Y is justified if:
- Pre-Emptive Protection Against Rights Violations
	- X consists of arbitrary individuals
	- The property of X is redistributed, i.e. taxation, AND
	- Such a redistribution is required to protect Y from rights-violations; independent Y's actions Y cannot otherwise acquire protection
	=> Justifies the necessities: police, prisons, courts, military, border, education (w/out education, you will be taken advantage of)
- Pre-Emptive Protection Against Rights Frustrations
	- X consists of arbitrary individuals 
	- The property of X is redistributed, i.e. taxation, AND
	- Such a redistribution is required to protect Y from rights-frustrations; similar to above
	=> Justifies life-saving programs: firefighting, disaster relief, welfare, healthcare, education, etc. 
		- So should government replace insurance? E.g. Health insurance, car insurance, home insurance, etc. all necessary for protection.
		- This may be a better justification of education. Public education is justified even if we know people won't be taken advantaeg of.
- Monopoly Regulation
	- X consists of companies
	- X's market transactions affects Y, AND
	- X's market transactions are regulated according to the votes of Y, AND
	- X has a monopoly over some product/service/good for Y,
	=> Justifies utilities/anti-monopolies laws: electricity, water, internet, roads, monopoly regulation, etc.
- Market Restrictions to make transactions possible
	- 
	- 
	=> Justifies: protections against theft, fraud, market defamation, contract enforcement, false advertising, information about one's product/service
- Behaviors that put others at the risk of physical harm or (or the rationally expected risk) 
	- 
	- 
	=> Justifies: protection against threats, certain forms of personal defamation, drunk driving, hate speech in Nazi Germany
- Market restrictions to meet the interests of the inhabitants of an area
	- 
	- 
	=> Justifies: protections against occupational/housing/employment hazards, food/drug regulations

### By Contemporary Politics

Left-Leaning:

- Abortion
    - No restrictions
- Criminal justice
    - Rehabilitation and safety
    - Decriminalize drugs, don't legalize
	- Not retribution. Consider the cases:
		- Agent is morally evil but no longer a threat.
			- Has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed (not rehabilitated). He experiences no suffering. Should we still inflict harm?
		- Agent is a threat but not morally good. 
			- He should be rehabilitated, expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed. Doesn't matter whether this is due to moral corruption or uncontrollable circumstances.
		- Agent is neither morally bad or a threat.
			- Has been rehabilitated.
		- We can agree that if an agent has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed, then we shouldn't inflict suffering. Why is this not also true if he's been rehabilitated.
- Gay marriage
    - Government shouldn't be involved in marriage.
    - If they are, then it should not discriminate based on sex.
- Subsidized Loans
    - Only awarded to those likely to repay them (based on e.g. test scores, grades, etc.)
    - Only have to be paid off after acquiring a certain income level
- Subsidized Healthcare
    - Maybe, if its effective.

Right-Leaning:

- Free Speech
	- Hate Speech allowed
	- Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Nazi Germany)
- Freedom of Association
	- Including discrimination
    - Not inherently wrong
    - Wrong if its arbitrary and exclusionary (rather than balancing)
    - Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Racist USA)
- Affirmative Action
    - Ineffective insofar as it admits students of low standards
    - Don't care otherwise
- Welfare 
    - Provide a means of living for the poor
    - Maybe enough for a limited number of children
    - Don't incentivize unlimited reproduction for the unfit
- Immigration
    - We have the right to any restrictions
    - We should filter in-demand immigrants that can't be filled by natives
    - I desire low influx of immigrants

Other:

- Gun Control
	- Don't care
- Education 
    - Make impractical subjects optional
    - Less encouragement for college
    - Add practical skills
    - Add values.
