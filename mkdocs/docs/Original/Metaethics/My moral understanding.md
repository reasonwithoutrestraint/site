Outline

1. Normative Thinking
    - Some behaviors are independent of thought (involuntary actions)
    - Some behaviors are motivated by thoughts, call these motivational thoughts (undeliberate voluntary actions).
    - Some motivational thoughts are reformed via deliberation, call this deliberation normative reasoning (deliberate voluntary actions).  
2. Plattitudes of normativity: 
    - ubiquity
    - motivation
    - rational/deliberative 
    - disagreement 
    - supervenience 
3. Normative Unification: 
    - Relation between agents and behaviors.
    - Kinds of reasons: wrong kinds of reasons.
    - Ought implies can and cannot
4. Cognitivist Non-descriptivist:
    - Judgment Internalism:
        - A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
        - Reflective/deliberative endorsement
        - Neither belief nor desire
    - Not descriptivist
        - Emotive, expressive, prescriptive.
        - Descriptions judgments cannot be necessarily motivating.
    - We may be capable of revising our normative discourse (e.g. see judgments of epistemic rationality).
5. Normative Truth:
    - Existence Internalism:
        - X is a normative reason for A iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational
        - Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational deliberation.
    - Possible theories:
        - Ideal dispositionalist
        - Constructivist
    - Quasi-truth-apt (rationality-apt) and Quasi-Objectivism: All purported values of robust objectivity & truth-aptness can be met:
        - Normativity is rational
        - Certain normative judgments are better than others.
        - Better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments (dependent on hypothetical judgments or constiuitive features of judgments).
6. Constituents of different normative domains
    - rationality
        - consistency
        - coherence
    - morality
        - prudential reasons with an impartiality/social constriant
        - reasons for distinctively moral attitudes
        - norms generated from constructed relationships
7. Morality is rationally optional, but this doesn't diminish its authority
    - Contingent on our interests:
        - Nearly universal: most people interested in impartial/social reasons, having a system of norms regulating blame.
        - Emphasizes the negotiation aspect: people cant just have independent that they claim are objective with no consideration of other person's reasons.
        - Other analogues: Scientific reasons are impartial/social reasons for belief (and thus evidentially optional), but that doesn't diminish its authority.
    - Not externally necessarily justifiable, like all normative domains
        - Deduction/induction/abduction/evidence/science cannot be reasonable to someone who doesn't care for those forms of reasoning
8. There are no judgment-independent standards of moral truth, but that's a good thing:
    - People cannot just come with arbitrary principles and claim them as the moral virtues.
    - They are forced to take into account the interests of others.
    - They are forced to make their demands reasonable to others. 
    - Moral reasoning is a process of negotiation rather than of discovery.

Questions:

1. Requirements for cognitivism (language)
2. Requirements for descriptivism (mind)
3. Requirements for motivational/rational force (normativity)
4. Normative Reduction (language)
5. Distinct features of morality (language)
6. Non-external justifications of knowledge domains (epistemology)

## Metaethics

#### Normative Plattitudes

`Questions`

1. What are the essential requirements that any decent analysis of normativity/morality must meet?

As agents:

1. Ubiquity - We cannot rid ourselves of normative judgments.
2. Motivational - Our normative judgments influence our behavior.
3. Reasoning - Normative argumentation/reasoning influences our normative judgments (possibly for the better, possibly based on an objective standard).
4. Disagreement - We have genuine non-linguistic normative disagreements.
5. Supervenience - Apt normative predication supervenes on descriptive facts.

Any successful analysis of normative judgments must be able to account for these plattitudes. Normative propositions can be said to be true just in case these requirements are respected.  

A theory of normative truth will be non-deflationary (even if anti-realist/revisionary) for a particular normative domain so long as it provides interpersonal standards for (3) normative argumentation/reasoning. So long as there are solid interpersonal standards for normative argumentation/reasoning, it can be said that normative truth/warrant is whatever follows from those standards.

Showing these plattitudes:

1. See Korsgaard's work: animals believe what they perceive, and act based on their desires. Humans don't just take perceptions and desires at face-value; we reason and think about whether these perceptions/desires justify beliefs/actions. There is a cognitive, conscious process of normative reasoning standing between perceptions/desires and actions. This is normative reason. This doesn't necessarily commit me to saying that normative truth consists in what is entailed from this, but only that we all participate in normative reasoning. Normative truth might, e.g. consist in what is entailed from normative reason under proper conditions.
2. All synthetic judgments beliefs stem from normative reasoning, either deductive reasoning (e.g. for a priori judgments) or inductive reasoning (e.g. for a posteriori judgments). Not only is there the normative approval or deductive/inductive reasoning as a form of reasoning, but also the normative judgment that particular propositions follow from inductive reasoning. E.g. a person might think they accept inductive reasoning for non-normative reasons; fine, but it is still a normative question whether a particular belief inductively follows in any non-trivial set of experiences.

#### Normative Unification

`Questions`

1. Find essential characteristics of normative judgments, i.e. are the judgments about properties or relations? If relations, concerning what objects?
2. Reduce all normative terms to one term or relation.
3. Determine how to distinguish different normative systems (e.g. epistemology, justice, morality, ettiquette, rationality, etc.).

All normative judgments can be expressed in the form of a prescription that recommends a particular behavior X for an agent A under circumstances C. This can also be expressed in declarative form via some relation that involves entities A, X, C. The basic terms underlying this relation can be any term that supports this relation grammatically, i.e. "A ought to X in circumstances C", "A has reason to X in circumstances C", "A is justified in X in circumstances C", "It is fitting for A to X in circumstances C", etc.

A normative system can be understood by the following components:

- T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.) - this constraints genuine normative statements to be action guiding in some way. Normative propositions that cannot be expressed in this manner are not coherent normative propositions.
- R - The considerations that serve as reasons for the norm. Different normative realms have different relavent considerations.
Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
- S - The actual norms of the normative system. These are entailed from whatever the relevant considerations are plus any observational content.

Other considerations concerning the content of normative judgments

- Right/Wrong kinds of reason
- Ought implies can & cannot
- Is/Ought gap -> logical/analytic/synthetic

#### Normative Analysis

`Questions`

1. What is the phenomonelogical/psychological status of normative judgments, in particular judgments where someone judges that they themselves have reason to perform an action?
2. How do these states of mind relate to desires or beliefs? Some possibilities
	- Desires, sentiments, pro/con attitudes, (dis)approving attitudes
	- Dispositions to have those attitudes
	- Dispositions to express those attitudes in normative discussion / negotiation
	- Beliefs about whether those attitudes would be held under ideal conditions (subjective).
	- Beliefs about the non-attitudinal state of affairs about an entity (objective).
3. What are competing analysis of this state of mind? How do they differ? What do they have in common? 
4. A two-level analysis? First level analysis: expressions of non-cognitivist state of mind, e.g. desires, sentiments, (dis)approval, (dispositions to) resent/blame others, etc. Second level analysis: some sort of deliberative, reflective endorsement of those states (e.g. beliefs that such states would be held ideal circumstances, higher-order desires, etc.). Second level introduces standards of correctness and refinement, and are motivating insofar as one is reflective, deliberative, rational, etc. This is similar to the distinction between *perceiving* something to be red (i.e. having a certain physiological sensation) and *believing* something to be red (i.e. believing that such sensations would be produced under ideal circumstances).
5. Much of our normative discourse practically rational, where we use thick ethical concepts to guide our discussions. E.g. saying an action is racist is both descriptive and evaluative at the same time. In principle, though, we can separate the evaluative from the descriptive (which is not to say that evaluative is not itself a belief).

Normative Phenomenology: normative judgments are neither expressive of beliefs nor desires. They are not expressive of beliefs because they entail a world-to-mind fit rather than a mind-to-world fit. No mind-to-world (descriptive) state of mind can be motivational, yet normative judgments are motivational. They are not expressive of desires because there are constitutive standards for normative judgments that are not true of desires, e.g. if one judges that they ought to X above anything else, they necessarily also judge that they ought to M if they believe M is the necessary means to achieve X. This is not true of desire. Rather, normative judgments express values. Values are our linguistically infused base desires and dispositions idealized by rational reflection.

Plattitudes:

- Ubiquity - Linguistic flexibility. Normative judgments can be expressed in a variety of different ways, "X is wrong", "we ought not do X", "Boo X!", "X is disgusting", "X is crappy", "we must not do X", "don't do X!", etc. It is unlikely that the referrents of the terms in each of these expressions are descriptive of the same entity. More likely, they are expressive of a certain motivating attitude in the being. 
- Judgment Internalism: A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational. Required for a few reasons: (1) the capacity to form normative judgments would not have been evolutionarily advantageous if they were not linked to motivation, (2) the normative judgments a person made would not matter if they were not linked to motivation; rather, it would be whatever those judgments were that were linked to motivation (which would should be termed REAL normative judgments).
- Disagreement: two distinct descriptions of a subjective state of mind cannot explain why people disagree over normative judgments.

Requirements for a descriptivist theory:
- Must be in some way descriptive of our attitudes to be motivating
- Must not be too tied to our actual attitudes to allow for internal criticism and external criticism
- Must not be reduced to non-normative idealized circumstances, to prevent ....

A descriptivist analysis of moral judgments is possible only if it has the following components (attitude-dispositionalist theory).
- Attitudinal: They must related to properties tied to normative attitudes. E.g. "X is good" means "X has attitude-independent property Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y" could work.
- Internal Criticism: They must allow for coherent questioning of one's present attitudes. E.g. "X produces attitude Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y under normal circumstances" could work.
- Non-reductive (maybe): The ideal conditions must not be purely non-normative. E.g. "X produces attitude Y under typical circumstances" will not work. But "X produces Y under ideal, rational circumstances" could work.

The attitudes which are diposed can be variable: desires, resentment, etc. Other dispositional theories do not work. E.g. moral language dispositionalism doesn't work (i.e. the properties that are causally responsible for our usage of the terms 'good' and 'right', etc.) because the causes of our moral terms are completely arbitrary social conventions. Also, we wouldn't be able to analyze the moral terms of a foreign language. Theories which aren't even dispositional (e.g. objective theories) are not plausible. 

Instead, normative judgments could be expressive of a non-cognitive state, which are attitudes with the following characteristics:
- Relation between desiring and valuing.
- Similarities
    - Have propositional content, i.e. value/desire that p be the case, unlike bare sensations.
    - Have a mind-to-world fit, i.e. dispositional rather than representational nature.
    - Desires explain intentions. Insofar as we are rational, values explain intentions.
- Differences
    - Desires explain intentional action, can be unreflective. Values are the upshots of deliberation. Reflective endorsement.
    - Desires are present in all animals that perform intentional actions, values only in animals with metacognition. Desires require intention. Values require thoughts about intentions.
    - Desires can conflict with values. What might not value what we desire. We might not desire what we value. 
    - Valuing can have constitutive constraints.
- Possible analysis:
    - Valuing X = some form of reflective/deliberative endorsement. What is a reflective/deliberative endorsement? Neither belief nor desire.
    - Valuing X = Desiring to desire X. 
    - Valuing X = Believing that X would be desired if one were fully rational/informed. It may possible that this is compatible with the judgment internalism thesis (as a person would be moved to desire what they believed they would desire if they were fully rational/informed, insofar as they are rational), but there are still two issues:
        - If the theory is non-reductive (i.e. doesn't reduce what it is to judge something rational), then it does not accomplish the primary goal of normative analysis, which is to explain what it is to form a normative judgment in the first place. Surely, an analysis cannot be informative it does the following analysis: to judge that X is good is to believe that one would desire X if one were good. This is not informative.
        - If the theory is reductive, i.e. judging something rational is to believe XYZ, then it could have just used XYZ as the analysis to begin with.
    - Valuing X = Believing that X would be desired if one had unqualified cognitive/imaginitive powers and full factual/nomological information. This may also be compatible with the judgment internalism thesis, but:
        - Even though its sufficient to invoke a normative judgment, it doesn't seem necessary. This is not what we're doing when we make normative judgments. 
    - (general criticism) Valuing X = X would be desired if one were rational
        - These might give the correct truth conditions, but they miss the point.
        - When someone rationally endorse X, they aren't thinking about what they would desire in such and such circumstances.

Normative Cognitivism: Normative judgments are truth-apt, even though they are not descriptive. The conditions for truth is not based on a correspondence theory of truth. A normative judgment X can be said to be true of an agent A just in case an A could not reject X after idealization of his rational faculty, i.e. X is the upshot of rational idealization. For example, people cannot believe strictly contradictory propositions (i.e. P and ~P), thus it is irrational to believe in inconsistent propositions (i.e. P and Q where, without being realized by A, Q -> ~P) because if one's rational faculties where idealized (i.e. one believed that Q -> ~P), then one could not believe in the inconsistent propositions.

#### Normative Truth

`Questions`

1. What does it take for a statement or judgment to be truth-apt?
2. What are the standards of correctness for normative statements/judgments?

Forms of truth:

- General: Judgment S expresses state of mind M. S is _ if and only if M is _. 
- Descriptive Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal Judgments:
- Probabilistic Judgments:
- Causal Judgments:

Normative Judgments

- Epistemic Normativity: 
- Prudential Normativity: 
- Moral Normativity: 

Ways for accounting for normative truth in a non-descriptivist sense:

- Existence Internalism: 
    - Judgment Internalism: A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Existence Internalism: X is a normative reason for A iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational/informed deliberation.
- Possible conceptions:
    - Constructivism/Constitutivism: 
        - The truth of a normative judgment is contextualized to the truth of other normative jugdments an agent makes.
    - Subjective Naturalistism 
        - Same truth conditions as constructivism, but now with the existence of descriptive normative entities. 
        - Normative reasons are naturalistic entities posited to explain our informed, rational attitudes (motivating reasons explain actual attitudes).
        - Analogy: naturalistic non-normative entities posited to explain our idealized perceptions.

The naturalists, constructivists no-descriptivists need not disagree here about the truth conditions. They all agree that the truth of a normative judgment consists in it being rationally derivable.

Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.

#### Constituents of Normativity

`Questions`

1. What are the constituent features of rational deliberation?
1. What are the constituent features of epistemic norms, prudence, morality, etc?
2. Is morality rationally necessary?

Normativity/rationality generally:

- Capacities of agents as such:
    - Form beliefs - have a mind-to-world state of mind.
    - Perform intentional actions - have a world-to-mind state of mind.
- Requirements on normative thinking:
    - Consistency - Insofar as one believes a moral proposition (or any proposition), they cannot believe its negation.
    - Explanatory - Beliefs shouldn't just be unrelated consistent propositions; some propositions should explain the others. If our normative judgments where radically contextualized to particular times, places, circumstances, etc. then we could never make plans for the future.
    - Supervenience: The purpose of normative reasoning is to plan responses to circumstances in the future. No such plan can be useful if it gives different responses for the same circumstances.  

Reasons = judgments that would be formed following exercise of the above capacities with full respect to the above requirements, conditioned on any judgments which are constitutive of the normative domain in question.

Epistemic reasons

- Reason to follow principles of deduction: Insofar as one believes P and believes P->Q, why do they have necessary reason to believe Q? It cannot be because Q is true. There are plenty of true statements that we don't have reason to believe, also Q need not be true if either P or P->Q are false.
- Reason to accord beliefs to perception: Insofar as one perceives entity X with properties P, why do they have necessary reason to believe that X exists with certain properties? Insofar as one perceives a entity with certain properties, there is a tendency to believe that entity exists with those properties. If someone witnessed certain sensation without also having corresponding dispositions of beliefs that they mapped to reality, then they would be perceptions.

Prudential reasons

- Reason to satisfy ends: insofar as one values end X, why do they have necessary reason to act to bring about X? Insofar as one performs an intentional or voluntary action, it is done with the intention to bring about some end, i.e. it is done because one believes they have reason to perform it. Otherwise, it would be a nonvoluntary action.
- Reason to apply means-ends reasoning: Insofar as one take themselves to have reason to promote X, why do they have necessary reason to promote Y given that Y promotes X? Part of what it is to take oneself to have reason to promote X is to take oneself to have reason to perform the means to promote it. If one didn't take oneself to have reason to promote those means, they wouldn't think they have reason to promote X.
- Desires/motivations: Desires and motivations are not the same as values and reasons. 
    - For one, one can desire X or be motivated to bring about X without valuing X or judging that they have reson to bring about X.
    - Desires and motivations are not subject to the constitutive features of normative judgments. E.g. it doesn't follow from the mere fact that one desires X that they have reason to bring about X. It is not constitutive of desiring X that one also desires the means to bring about X (e.g. if X is have healthy teeth and the means is performing a painful dental operation)
    - Judgments of value and judgments of reasons do bear an interesting relationship to desires and motivations. It may be that normative judgments are the product of motivational features plus the following features: endorsement, reflection/deliberation, full consciousness/awareness, full information 

Moral reasons

- Taking into account the interests of others: insofar as one advances a moral judgment X, why do they have necessary reason to take into account the interests of others? Insofar as one advances a moral judgment, they are making an attempt to modify the behaviors and attitudes of others. If a person has no interest in modifying the judgments of others, they are not playing the morality game. To play the morality game well, they moral judgments that they advance must be judgments that others would accept if they were fully rational, i.e. they would need to advocate for moral norms that all persons have reason to respect.

What does it mean to say that certain rules are constitutive of a normative domain? It is not to say that people are incapable of violating that rule within that domain. Clearly people make normative errors. Rather, it is to say that people are incapable of violating that rule in full consciousness and awareness of what they are doing. For example, people can clearly hold contradictory beliefs. But they cannot hold those contradictory beliefs while in full consciousness and awareness of the implications of those beliefs. This can explain the motivation of normative judgments. A normative judgment is true for an agent if and only if the agent would hold that judgment in full consciousness (or some other circumstances), and valuing full consciousness (or those other circumstances) just is what it is to be a rational creature. For example, we are incapable of believing P and not P. This explains why it is irrational to believe propositions with contradictory implications, because if we were in full consciousness, we would/could not hold those beliefs. 

#### Morality

`Questions`

1. What does objectivity mean?
2. Why does objectivity matter?
3. When, if ever, can normativity/morality be objective?

Some features that might distinguish moral norms from other normative norms:

1. Moral norms = reasons for action with some interpersonal/social constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief).
    - Moral norms = individual practical reasons that everyone has.
    - Moral norms = reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness equally.
    - Moral norms = norms no one could reasonably reject if they were motivated to find norms to regulate cooperation. Agent A can reasonably reject norm N if A's decreased individual goodness from N is more important than others' increased individual goodness.
2. Norms for the appropriateness of distinctively moral attitudes (e.g. blame, shame, guilt, praise, etc.).
    - Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
    - Moral attitudes are particular evaluative attitudes with constitutive features.
        - Only directed at the features of an agent's character, not necessarily the effect of their actions.
        - A blames B if B's behavior impaired their relationship and A modifies his attitudes toward B. 
    - Moral attitudes are sanctions/rewards for modifying social behavior.
3. Norms for constructed kinds of relationships
    - To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
    - This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

Some notes on features of moral judgments:

1. What determines the content of the norms? Consequentialist or deontologist? If consequences, what consequences?
2. What determines the appropriateness of blame/praise in enforcing a norm in a particular circumstance? Is it based on whether the application is beneficial (consequentialist), or whether the agent deserves the blame/praise (deontological)?
3. The many functions of moral judgments:
    - Expressing the speaker's sentiments. E.g. express blame.
    - Modify the sentiments of the object of the judgment. E.g. invoke guilt.
    - Modify the sentiments of the broader society. E.g. invoke blame among society, both toward the particular agent and toward the relevant behavior in general.

Some analysis:

1. Morality is a system of norms administering blame/guilt. X is morally wrong = it is rational to blame one for doing X and it is rational to feel guilty for doing X.
2. Morality is a system of norms promoting social rationality - what actions would be rational when considering as equals the interests of all affected parties.
3. Morality properties are the natural facts that track and guide our use of moral concepts.
4. Morality consists in what is entailed from the constitutive features of morality
    - Morality is a system of norms that no one could rationally reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation.
5. Moral truth consist in what an idealized otherwise normal agent would morally endorse. 
6. Morality follows from pure rationality
    - Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
    - There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals, metaphysical egoism is false.

Each of these are probably illuminating features of morality. They are each referring to distinct realms of evaluations that can be coherently called "morality". Thus, morality doesn't have one distinct meaning, but multiple. 

Aesthetic morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating actions generally. 
- Judgments can be given either a constitutivist or dispositionalist analysis, found in all human cultures/societies.
- The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise. 
- On one reading, the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent). Thus, this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). Probably in line with the constitutivist analysis. This may be relative to contingent sensibilities.
- On another reading, these emotions have no constitutive meaning per se. They are mere tools to regulate society. As such, these emotions are warranted insofar as they promote the good of society (just as with individual rationality), i.e. positive states of consciousness, etc. The good of society should also be constrained in some way by consideration of the interests the agents who are issued duties, for it is assumed that all agents have reason to be moral.
- Sits somewhere between ettiquette and objective morality below, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette. 
- If a moral statement is true in this sense for a person, then they would be motivated to respect its law if they were informed/rational.

Justice morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as aesthetic morality.
- Judgments can be given a constructivist analysis, not necessarily found in all human cultures/societies.
- The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). 
- This is objective and universal across all rational beings, even those lacking our particular emotions of blame/praise, even those lacking consciousness or an experience of well-being. So a group of rational beings may have no basis for morality in the aesthetic sense, yet they would have it in this justice sense.
- This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority. 
- Moral statements might be true in this sense, but a person need not have any motivation or even reason to respect its law in any particular circumstances (even if they were fully informed/rational). They would have a reason, rather, to support the construction of rules which society agrees to respect.

[Ettiquette (aesthetics)] <----> [Optional Morality (aesthetics; justifies praise/blame)] <----> [Forceful Morality (justifies law & force)]

Three types of norms regulating behavior:

1. Ettiquette - violations call for irritation
2. Morality - violations call for shame
3. Justice - violations call for force

Three types of reasons in favor of a norm:

1. Private consequentialist: Consequentialist reason to follow the norm; depends on personal interests that would be promoted by the individual following the norm. 
2. Private constitutive: Constitutive reason to follow the norm (i.g. "right" kind of reason); depends on personal, contingent sentiments, etc. a la secondary qualities. I think describes ettiquette, morality and aesthetics. If true reasons, people will be motivated to respect it in particular circumstances.
3. Public constructive: Reason to support societal construction of the norm; depends on desire to live in a certain sort of society with certain accepted rules. Can apply to people regardless of personal sentiments. I think describes forceful morality (i.e. justice, law) and possibly aeshtetic morality and ettiquette. People might not be motivated to respect it in any particular circumstance, but they will be motivated to support it as a rule that society agrees to respect.

On this understanding, we can still call animal cruelty wrong on the basis of aesthetic moral sentiments of normal humans. But could we be justified in using force to stop animal cruelty? Can aesthetic moral sentiments justify imposing force on others? Or can there be a constructive reason to enact norms to protect animal cruelty? In general, how can we support using force to stop the harm of individuals (animals or humans) outside of our social contract? This does afford the libertarian protective rights for people in society (as is desired), but it does not provide even minimum rights for people outside of society, i.e. it never justifies us to use force to stop them from being harmed.

## Substantive morality

#### Types of moral arguments

To argue that a particular act X is wrong/right in a particular circumstance C, there are a few possible arguments:

- Appeal to some fundamental principle that provides a determinate answer to the rightness/wrongness of X in circumstance C. See below for arguments in favor of fundamental principles. Of course, this is assuming that the fundamental moral principles form determinate answers, which need not be the case. This also assumes that there are fundamental moral principles, which need not be the case.
- Appeal to the obvious rightness/wrongness of an analogous act X' in an analogous circumstance C'. This theory can remain agnostic to the truth/weight of any fundamental moral principles (if any such principles even exist). This strategy is committed only to the fact that there clearly is a constraint on which *considerations* are morally relevant (regardless of whether and how those considerations can be reduced to certain principles). Considerations such as happiness, desires, autonomy, responsibility, etc. are potentially relevant moral considerations (i.e. humans clearly use these considerations in ordinary moral thinking; whether they really should be used and/or whether some of these are only instrumentally valuable is a further question). But there are clearly considerations that don't count as morally relevant. This style of argument works if it can be shown that the differences between C and C' are definitely not potentially relevant moral considerations.

To argue for certain fundamental principles:

- Reflective Equilibrium: Argue that these principles best explain, or cohere with, our considered moral judgments. The problem here is that the best principles that explain our moral judgments might not be nonconflicting, i.e. the considerations that explain our considered moral judgments might not reduce to the same principles (which means it might not provide determinate answers in all circumstances), and/or different people might have fundamentally different irreconcilable considered moral judgments.
- Foundational: Build these principles from the ground up, either from a metaethical theory, or pure rationality, or pure consistency, or from minimal constraints on any coherent moral theory. This may be too ambitious.

#### The Good

Possibilties for individual goodness:

- Narrow hedonism (sensory pleasure): states of consciousness marked by some distinctive feature
- Preference hedonism (attitudinal pleasure): preferred states of consciousness
- Unrestricted preference satisfaction: satisfaction of whatever preferences
- Success theory: satisfaction of preferences about one's own life, i.e. preferences about features that are introspectively discernable
- Objective list theory: knowledge, friendship, etc.
- Other constraints: S taking attitudinal pleasure in state of affairs P, only when S deserves that pleasure and P deserves to happen.

Collective Goodness:

- Summation over everyone's individual goodness.
- Average over everyone's individual goodness.
- No reducible metrics; only pareto optimal solutions.
- Distributions that would be preferred by everyone if they didn't know where they would fall within the distribution.
- Small diminishes to someone with high well-being for a large increase to someone with low well-being.

#### The Right - Fundamental moral principles 

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:

- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
	    - There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
	    - Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)

#### Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	
- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	
- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 

equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources. 
	
- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	
- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.

Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	
- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.

Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	
- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	
- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.

Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 

- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.

Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	
- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	
- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

#### My Theory

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property) as indicated above. Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

I'm not sure what these "special circumstances" consist in, but one trivial example where such force can be exerted is this: when A is intoxicated or when is uninformed. Perhaps the circumstance is this: whenever A's values/interests commits himself to be controlled by others in a certain situation. The reason this allows for force is because people can be wrong about their values/interests and therefore force (rather than, say, reason) may be the only way to promote their values/interests.

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 

1. rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others actually attempt to, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. It is necessary but not sufficient that others be unable to use/appropriate an equal share. It must also be shown that such individuals actually attempted to get such a share. If they never tried to use/appropriate such a share to begin with, then they are owed nothing, since their interests/values were never limited in promotion of someone else's.
2. some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which: (a) people are free to exit the community, (b) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and (c) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the lives of others. Note that this communal property probably isn't justified on any self-ownership principle; rather, it's justified because such property may be necessary for promotion of certain peoples' values/interests. In fact, there are levels to the extent that property is communal vs. private:
	- The larger the scope of a region that's communally owned, the more communal it is and the less private it is. Communal properties that are mostly private (e.g. small neighborhoods) can enforce larger constraints on behavior than larger communal properties that are mostly communal (e.g. cities). The reason smaller communities are afforded by restrictions is because conditions (a), (b) and (c) are more likely to be met. Smaller, more restricting communities, may be required to pay into a federal fund that that acts to sustain areas of the land where only libertarian laws are enforced, so that (a) and (b) are truly satisfied. Insofar as one cannot escape such a community (or if all available property is used up), compensation is obligatory for individuals (in the form of safety net, welfare, redistribution, etc.). 
	- Rather than thinking of (a) private property and (b) communal property in this binary fashion, it may be more useful to think of all property on a scale that goes from private to communal. The more private the property is, the stronger the full ownership rights will be. The more communal the property is, the weaker the rights will be. Note that nothing is fully private, not even a person's body (since I have shown that one's body may sometimes be controlled by others if it promotes the agent's values/interests). The extent to which property is private versus communal (i.e. the nature/strength of the ownership rights of that property) depends on the extent to which ownership of said property influences the values/interests of others. The more impactful ownership of certain property is to certain people (e.g. the only lake in the country), the more communal that property ought to be, among those people. The less impactful ownership of that property is to certain people (e.g. one of many empty plots of land in the city), the more property that property ought to be. Handling use of communal property should be done via a mechanism that best promotes the values/interests of the subjects involved, giving more weight to individuals influenced more by the property.
