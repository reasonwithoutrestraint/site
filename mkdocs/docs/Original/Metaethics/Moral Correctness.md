# Moral Correctness

## Moral Reasons

### Constructivism

Moral propositions are not true based on some *correspondence*. We *construct* moral truth.

### Dispositionalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X is such as to elicit R in circumstances c. The circumstances C can be given several formulations such as, e.g., normal circumstances.

This is similar to the truth conditions for when an entity is a certain color. I.e. X is red if and only if X is such as to elicit the perception of redness in normal humans under normal circumstances.

This will not work for moral terms because:

1. It cannot be used to criticize conventional moral responses.
2. It doesn't explain why one's evaluative judgments influence their emotional response, whereas one's judgments about color concepts don't influence their color perceptions. 
3. It doesn't explain why moral truth can be discovered a priori under reflection, whereas truth about color concepts cannot.

This may be improved by focusing on *idealized* circumstances rather than *normal* circumstances.

### Rational Sentimentalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X has the properties ascribed by the emotional response R. 

For example, to fear X involves some sort of perception that it is dangerous. This is constitutive of fear, and there is clear evolutionary reason to develop such a psychological faculty. One has reason, then, to fear X if and only if X is dangerous. Moral emotions, e.g. blame, resentment, guilty, etc., are emotions like that.

This is kind of siimilar to "thick" ethical concepts, except with sentimentalism the attitudes are guiding the correct application of the concepts as opposed to the concepts being constructed in a way that picks out certain features.

## Possibilities

### Distinctively moral attitudes

One feature of moral norms, as opposed to other norms, is that they are concerned with the appropriateness of distinctively moral attitudes, as opposed to non-moral attitudes such as beliefs, amusement, fear, etc. Some characterizations of moral attitudes

- Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
- Moral attitudes are particular evaluative attitudes with constitutive features.
    - Only directed at the features of an agent's character, not necessarily the effect of their actions.
    - A blames B if B's behavior impaired their relationship and A modifies his attitudes toward B. 
- Moral attitudes are sanctions/rewards for modifying social behavior.

### Reasons with an interpersonal/social constraint

Moral reasons can be distinguished from practical reasons in that the moral reasons are reasons for action with some interpersonal/social constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief).

- Moral norms = individual practical reasons that everyone has.
- Moral norms = reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness equally.
- Moral norms = norms no one could reasonably reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation. Agent A can reasonably reject norm N if A's decreased individual goodness from N is more important than others' increased individual goodness.

### Norms deriving from constructed relationships

- To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
- This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

### Moral reasons = practical reasons

- Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
- There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals, metaphysical egoism is false.

### Some notes

- Moral reasons become actual prudential reasons contingent upon an agent taking into account the interests of others.
- This makes blaming/shaming a tool rather than evaluation. Thus, they would be appropriate insofar as the agent in question could be motivated by the attitudes. This may seem to focus too much on the utility of blame/shame at the expense of whether blame/shame is truly *appropriate* (i.e. whether the blame is warranted or deserved). However, it seems that we already have an intuition that blame is only warranted/deserved when an agent could be motivated by the considerations prompting the blame. For example, you wouldn't blame animals, children, aliens or bonified human enemies. Not only does blame seem inappropriate in those cases, it also doesn't seem that the concept of warranted/deserved blame applies in those circumstances. Blame/shame is reserved for persons who have already implicitly agreed to coordinate with us and take into account our interests. The same goes for social approval/disapproval generally.
- Rational requirements are not binding for all agents. They are binding only for *rational* agents. Likewise, moral requirements are not binding for all agents or all rational agents. They are binding only for *moral* agents, i.e. those who happen to already take an interest in the coordination/cooperation involved in fitting with society.

## Two forms of moral norms

- Insofar as moral judgments are expressive of one's attitudes (think: X is disgusting!), they can have standards of correctness to determine whether one has reason to hold the attitude in question. This works the same as standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments in general, and for reasons in general (e.g. perhaps by appealing to the refined attitudes that would be had by the speaker if he were more informed and idealized). There no objective standards on this form of moral judgment, as there are no objective standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments. 
- Insofar as moral judgments are tools to shape the attitudes of others ("Don't do X" or "shame the behavior of X"), the standards of correctness reduce to the reasons that other agents have to obey the prescriptions, i.e. to refrain from doing X or to shaming the doing of X. These would have to be not just reasons as such, but reasons contingent upon a goal of establishing a system of norms to coordinate the behavior of others in society. This would be objective standards of correctness for this form of moral judgments, as there is a fixed goal the promotion of which has objective right answers. Without this fix, we wouldn't have an objective standard of correctness and we would all have different reasons.

Aesthetic and Justice morality

Aesthetic morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating actions generally. 
- Judgments can be given either a constitutivist or dispositionalist analysis, found in all human cultures/societies.
- The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise. 
- On one reading, the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent). Thus, this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). Probably in line with the constitutivist analysis. This may be relative to contingent sensibilities.
- On another reading, these emotions have no constitutive meaning per se. They are mere tools to regulate society. As such, these emotions are warranted insofar as they promote the good of society (just as with individual rationality), i.e. positive states of consciousness, etc. The good of society should also be constrained in some way by consideration of the interests the agents who are issued duties, for it is assumed that all agents have reason to be moral.
- Sits somewhere between ettiquette and objective morality below, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette. 
- If a moral statement is true in this sense for a person, then they would be motivated to respect its law if they were informed/rational.

Justice morality: 

- This is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as aesthetic morality.
- Judgments can be given a constructivist analysis, not necessarily found in all human cultures/societies.
- The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). 
- This is objective and universal across all rational beings, even those lacking our particular emotions of blame/praise, even those lacking consciousness or an experience of well-being. So a group of rational beings may have no basis for morality in the aesthetic sense, yet they would have it in this justice sense.
- This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority. 
- Moral statements might be true in this sense, but a person need not have any motivation or even reason to respect its law in any particular circumstances (even if they were fully informed/rational). They would have a reason, rather, to support the construction of rules which society agrees to respect.

Three types of norms regulating behavior:

1. Ettiquette - violations call for irritation
2. Morality - violations call for shame
3. Justice - violations call for force

Three types of reasons in favor of a norm:

1. Private consequentialist: Consequentialist reason to follow the norm; depends on personal interests that would be promoted by the individual following the norm. 
2. Private constitutive: Constitutive reason to follow the norm (i.g. "right" kind of reason); depends on personal, contingent sentiments, etc. a la secondary qualities. I think describes ettiquette, morality and aesthetics. If true reasons, people will be motivated to respect it in particular circumstances.
3. Public constructive: Reason to support societal construction of the norm; depends on desire to live in a certain sort of society with certain accepted rules. Can apply to people regardless of personal sentiments. I think describes forceful morality (i.e. justice, law) and possibly aeshtetic morality and ettiquette. People might not be motivated to respect it in any particular circumstance, but they will be motivated to support it as a rule that society agrees to respect.

On this understanding, we can still call animal cruelty wrong on the basis of aesthetic moral sentiments of normal humans. But could we be justified in using force to stop animal cruelty? Can aesthetic moral sentiments justify imposing force on others? Or can there be a constructive reason to enact norms to protect animal cruelty? In general, how can we support using force to stop the harm of individuals (animals or humans) outside of our social contract? This does afford the libertarian protective rights for people in society (as is desired), but it does not provide even minimum rights for people outside of society, i.e. it never justifies us to use force to stop them from being harmed.

Substantive

1. What determines the content of the norms? Consequentialist or deontologist? If consequences, what consequences?
2. What determines the appropriateness of blame/praise in enforcing a norm in a particular circumstance? Is it based on whether the application is beneficial (consequentialist), or whether the agent deserves the blame/praise (deontological)?

## Notes on Objectivity

Morality is rationally optional, but this doesn't diminish its authority:

- Contingent on our interests:
	- Nearly universal: most people interested in impartial/social reasons, having a system of norms regulating blame.
	- Emphasizes the negotiation aspect: people cant just have independent that they claim are objective with no consideration of other person's reasons.
	- Other analogues: Scientific reasons are impartial/social reasons for belief (and thus evidentially optional), but that doesn't diminish its authority.
- Not externally necessarily justifiable, like all normative domains
	- Deduction/induction/abduction/evidence/science cannot be reasonable to someone who doesn't care for those forms of reasoning

There are no judgment-independent standards of moral truth, but that's a good thing:

- People cannot just come with arbitrary principles and claim them as the moral virtues.
- They are forced to take into account the interests of others.
- They are forced to make their demands reasonable to others. 
- Moral reasoning is a process of negotiation rather than of discovery.
