# Moral Correctness

There seems to be a connection between moral norms and rationality. That is, insofar as an agent does what is morally wrong, or fail to see what really is morally wrong, we believe the agent is being *irrational*. They are not receptive to the *moral reasons* that apply to them. The question, then, is how to characterize moral reasons. 

## Kinds of moral norms

(Descriptive) Non-naturalism and (descriptive) naturalistic asentimentalism are bogus. Mere descriptions of reality cannot explain how agents have reason to do anything because of Global Constructivism about reasons.

Sentimentalism and constructivism are promising.

Two kinds of moral reasons and two different standards of truth

## Sentimentalist

Sentimental morality (aesthetic): truth predicated on the appropriateness of moral attitudes. This will be rational sentimentalism (assuming there is anything constituitive of moral attitudes) or dispositionalism. This emphasizes the *expressive* role of moral feelings.

Insofar as moral judgments are expressive of one's attitudes (think: X is disgusting!), they can have standards of correctness to determine whether one has reason to hold the attitude in question. This works the same as standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments in general, and for reasons in general (e.g. perhaps by appealing to the refined attitudes that would be had by the speaker if he were more informed and idealized).

Whatever the standard of correctness (either constituitive or dispositional), the standards of correctness will have to depend on the particular nature of moral emotions (i.e. blame, shame, resentment, anger, etc.). Because correctness depends on contingent psychological sensibilities, correctness is not mind-independent in a way sufficient for objectivity. This is similar to aesthetic judgments in general (think ettiquette) and perhaps secondary properties. Therefore, any true applications of these norms to someone must require that the standards can *motivate* the agent, or they would *motivate* an ideal agent.

### Theories

Two classes of moral attitudes:
1. Generic attitudes of approval/disapproavl
2. Specific natural emotions: anger, guilt, shame, etc.

Non-cognitive features of generic attitudes:
- *Expressive*: Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
- *Prescriptive*: Moral attitudes are tools for modifying social behavior.

A note about Specific Natural Emotions:
- While some natural emotions (e.g. fear) have specific constitutive conditions for their appropriateness, it seems moral emotions might not. E.g. the appropriateness of anger can not be understood in purely non-normative terms; fear is appropriate only when someone has been wronged.

Some standards include subjectivism, dispositionalism, and rational sentimentalism.

### Simple Subjectivism

Too simple

### Dispositionalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X is such as to elicit R in circumstances c. The circumstances C can be given several formulations such as, e.g., normal circumstances.

This is similar to the truth conditions for when an entity is a certain color. I.e. X is red if and only if X is such as to elicit the perception of redness in normal humans under normal circumstances.

This will not work for moral terms because:

1. It cannot be used to criticize conventional moral responses.
2. It doesn't explain why one's evaluative judgments influence their emotional response, whereas one's judgments about color concepts don't influence their color perceptions. 
3. It doesn't explain why moral truth can be discovered a priori under reflection, whereas truth about color concepts cannot.

This may be improved by focusing on *idealized* circumstances rather than *normal* circumstances.

### Rational Sentimentalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X has the properties ascribed by the emotional response R. 

For example, to fear X involves some sort of perception that it is dangerous. This is constitutive of fear, and there is clear evolutionary reason to develop such a psychological faculty. One has reason, then, to fear X if and only if X is dangerous. Moral emotions, e.g. blame, resentment, guilty, etc., are emotions like that.

This is kind of siimilar to "thick" ethical concepts, except with sentimentalism the attitudes are guiding the correct application of the concepts as opposed to the concepts being constructed in a way that picks out certain features.

## Constructivism

Constructivist morality: truth predicated predicated on standards implicit in moral *discussion*. Implicit in moral discussion is that the considerations that each parties presents counts as *reasons* for the other party to take into account. This emphasizes the *prescriptive* role of moral arguments.

Insofar as moral judgments are tools to shape the attitudes of others ("Don't do X" or "shame the behavior of X"), the standards of correctness reduce to the reasons that other agents have to obey the prescriptions, i.e. to refrain from doing X or to shaming the doing of X. These are not just reasons as such (because there isn't a shared set of reasons shared by everyone), but reasons contingent upon a goal of establishing a system of norms to coordinate the behavior of others in society. 

There are objective standards of correctness for this form of moral judgments, as there is a fixed goal which there are objectively (in)correct methods for satisfying the goal. This form of moral correctness is the form that grounds claims of *justice* (when political institutions are *wrong* in a way stronger than just saying they warrant blame/shame). Note that these standards are not motivating for (even ideal versions of) all individuals/societies, particularly those individuals/societies that don't use discussion/argument (rather than rhetoric, emotional, threats, force, divinity, etc.) as a means to persuading others to adopt certain moral norms. Such norms would still be applicable to these parties (i.e. we could still call them morally wrong), but they could never appreciate these standards.

This locates the source of rationality that we feel is implicit in morality. We find that we really don't think people are *irrational* per se when they are immoral, i.e. we probably wouldn't acuse Hitler, psychopaths, war enemies, etc. of being irrational when they do something we find immoral. And we don't even acuse them of being irrational for beleiving that they're morally justified (assuming their judgments are consistent with the judgments of their idealized selves). We acuse them of being irrational when they try to justify their actions to us in moral *argument* and *discussion*. 

### The framework

1. Constructive
2. Implicit commitments
3. Communicative commitments
4. Impartiality 
5. Reasons for everyone to accept ...

Now, there is no reason for an action that is not the rational extension of an agent's desires, ends, goals, etc. So there can be no morality that provides reasons independent of contingent aims, goals, etc. This is fine. Science works like this as well. Moral reasons are reasons that follow contingent on certain ends. There is no way to 100% motivate someone to be moral, nor is there a way to categorically guarantee the rationality of morality. The question is, what are the ends that are constituitive of morality? It is important that we do not arbitrarily choose certain ends that seem favorable, as there would be no basis for this. We cannot choose ends that are constituitive of a moral *feeling* or *judgment*, as there are no restrictions implicit in such an emotion. Instead, we look to moral *argument* and moral *discussion* and find what is implicit in such discussions.

### Communicative Commitments

Standards of correctness. Some examples:
* Explicit: if someone says "X is P", then we can look at the *content* of that proposition to determine some standards of correctness. E.g. if we were to also say "X is not P", then by merely looking at the *content*, we could deduce that the proposition must be incorrect.
* Hard Implication: if someone were to speak "I am not speaking", we could not look purely at the *content* of the proposition to determine whether it were false. If we know nothing about a person, then such a proposition could be true or false. Instead, we look at the *assertion* of the statement, whether than the *content* of the statement, to determine that the statement must be false.
* Soft Implication: in moral discussion, the *issuing* of a moral command implies that the receiver has reason to follow the rule. 
	- What's implicit in *moral* discussion
	- Discussions generally?
	- Negotiations?

Communicative principles in other domains

1. We can no longer look internally at the merely systematizing the judgments themselves. Because there can be conflicting internally coherent systems. 
2. We look to the meaning of the terms used and the context in which they are used. Normative terms like "right", "wrong", "good", "bad", "ought", etc. are all constructive. They only make sense with reference to an agent with specific goals and ends.
3. Examples: 
	- Prudential Rationality: there are no independent standards for bodily movements. But insofar as one is deliberative and reflective and evaluates their own actions, i.e. one is a rational agent, there are standards for behavior.
	- Games: there are no independent standards for moving small pieces across a checkered board. But insofar as one is playing chess, there are constituitive standards of the activity that entail standards of correctness.
	- Relationships: there are no independent standards of kindness, respect, loyalty, etc. with regard to how to treat others. But insofar as one is being a friend, partner or other normatively-laden relationships, there are constituitive standards of the activity that entail standards of behavior.
	- Communication: there are no independent standards of speaking or language. But insofar as one is communicating as a means to transfer ideas to someone else, there are standards of correctness.
	- Conversation: To engage in a *discussion* or *conversation* with someone, one implies that they will listen to the other party, not cut them off, etc. even though there may be no independent reason to do thees things. 
	- Negotiation: To engage in a *negotiation* implies that people are willing to sacrifice or deviate from their most preferred plan to help satisfy the interests of others. Now, one might have no reason to do these things (i.e. if they had full power), but then they wouldn't be negotiating. They would be bad negotiators. 
	- Morality: there are no independent standards of behavior. But insofar as one is engaged in moral argument as a procedure for finding *impartial reasons*, or reasons that all can accept, there are constituitive standards of correctness.

### Moral commitments

Impartiality: Moral reasons can be distinguished from practical reasons in that the moral reasons are reasons for action with some impartiality constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief). Possible conceptions of moral norms
- Individual practical reasons that everyone individual has.
	- Korsgaard: Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
	- Denial of Metaphysical Egoism: There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals.
- Reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness. 
	- Maximizing the total utility of everyone (e.g. utilitarianism).
	- Personal reasons a person has under the veil of ignorance.
- Contractualist:
	- Norms no one could reasonably reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation given that one has such a desire.
- Universalization:
	- Maxims that A can rationally willed to be a maxim followed by agents. This requires:
		- It be conceivable for the maxim to be universalizable, and
		- It be possible for someone to rationally will the maxim to be universalizable. E.g. Kant says (1) for any agent A, A's ends sometimes require help, (2) if all agents adopted a maxim whereby they never helped anyone, then this would frustrate A's end, therefore (3) A cannot rationally will a maxim that prescribe agents to never help.
	- Necessary but not sufficient.
		- Provides some formal constraints on possible maxims.
		- May need to be supplanted (e.g. with Contractualism) to account for immoral ends which are conceivable and rational.
	- Cannot account for moral actions that are inconceivable as universal laws
		- e.g. Donate to charity more than the average
	- Cannot account for immoral actions that are conceivable/rational as universal laws
		- e.g. Ritualized bullying for newcomers.
	- To stringent, e.g. Never Lie
	- Non-rational creatures have no moral consideration
- Kantian Contractualism (from Parfit)
	- Everyone ought to follow the principles whose universal acceptance everyone could rationally will.
	- "An act is wrong unless such acts are permitted by some principle whose universal acceptance everyone could rationally will"
	- Different from standard Kantianism which says "follow principles whose universal acceptance YOU could rationally will."


Note that the personal reasons a person has under the veil of ignorance =/= norms no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed cooperation. The difference is that the former is concerned with individual, personal reasons constrained with regard to information, whereas the latter are constituted by impartial, social reasons. E.g. even though it is rational to accept a system under the veil of ignorance that left everyone great except for one person who sufferred immensely, it would be rational for that one person to reject those norms as a basis for cooperation given a desire for cooperation.

Implications of A advocating for a norm in moral discussion:
- (Regulative) A thinks the the norm should regulate our actions, our societal standards for shame/praise, and individual standards for guilt/pride. 
- (Negotiative) A is willing to negotiate to cooperate and coordinate plans.
- (Impartial) A thinks the norm applies to, and can be justified to, everyone, including himself.
- (Individual Motivational) A *is disposed to* regulate his behavior as prescribed by the norm.
- (Communal Motivation) A thinks others are *capable* of being motivated to regulate their behavior in accord with the norm; they are capable of being receptive to the reasons favoring the norm. E.g. while it might make sense for A to *dislike* B's preference for ice crean, it doesn't make sense for A to *disapprove* of B's preference for ice cream, but it would make sense it B regarded A as his dietary adviser. This is true even when B's actions might harm A. E.g. it doesn't make sense for A to disapprove of B's attack against him if B would be completely unreceptive (e.g. animal, child, evil person, alien,s etc.), but it would make sense for someone who was receptive (i.e. normal rational agent).
- (Rationality) A thinks that he and others in society *have reason to* regulate their behavior as prescribed by the norm.

Two polarities regarding moral reasons:
1. Internal vs External: moral reasons cannot just be reduced to prudential reasons, since that would be like a bribe. But they also cannot be just reasons that derive from the institution of morality, since that would be not a genuine reason.
2. Personal vs Impartial: moral reasons cannot discount the interests of an individual, as then it would be irrational for one to accept them. But they also must be impartial.

Possible Standards
- To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
- This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

Conclusions:
- A norm is immoral if it neglects the fully rational interests of any particular agent.
- A norm cannot be immoral if it it meets the fully rational interests of every agent.
- A norm is immoral if it is indexical, values the interests of particular agents.
- Hard question: how to handle norms that harm some and help others.

### Other communicative/societal constraints

Communicative constraints regarding reasons for belief and/or conversations/arguments generally.
- Burden of proof depends on the speaker who asserts a claim, not on the mere content of the proposition. That someone asserts a claim has a burden of proof cannot be entailed from the content of the propositions expressed. When Mike says "God Exists", it follows that he has reason to follow the rule, even though this reason is not trivially included in the rational extension of his motivational set for beliefs.
- Even though an anecdotal experience might provide one with a personal reason for belief, it would not provide everyone with a reason for belief (e.g. a scientific reason).
- How to know what the standards are? We check what would happen if everyone accepted it. If no one accepted a burden of proof, the central goal of argument would be defeated.
- Don't interrupt others, cut them off, etc. Listen to them.

### Similarity with Golden Rule

Standards prescribing behaviors

Individual
- Motivational: Act so as to satisfy your desires.
- Rational: Act so as to satisfy the desires you have reason to have.

Golden Rule & Augmentations:
- Golden Rule: Treat others in the way you would want to be treated.
	- Upshot: don't kill if you wouldn't want to be killed. 
	- Problem 1: what if I would have different desires than the recipients? E.g. a masochist wouldn't mind being attacked.
	- Problem 2: what if I would have desires that people treat me unreasonably? E.g. I would want others to always benefit me at the expense of others. 
- Rationalized: Treat others not based on counterfactual desires, but on our counterfactual reasons for desires.
	- Upshot: don't kill if they don't have reason to want to be killed (e.g. even if they're in an intoxicated state where they want to be killed).
	- Doesn't solve either problem. Just idealizes desires.
- Inversed: Treat others in the way they want you to treat them.
	- Upshot: don't kill if the person wouldn't want to be killed.
	- Solves Problem 1.
- Abstracted: Treat others in accord with principles any rational agent would endorse, independent of their actual circumstances, desires, interests, etc. (i.e. veil of ignorance), if the agent knew he had a chance of any combination of circumstances or desires.
	- Upshot: don't kill it would be forbidden by any principles that no one could rationally reject.
	- Solves Problem 1 and Problem 2.
	- Reasons from Ignorant self-interest =/= reasons from morality.
- Moralized: Treat others in accord with principles no rational agent could rationally reject, contingent upon that agent having a goal of finding such principles that others couldn't rationally reject.

## Motivation

Both forms of morality explains why agents have reason to endorse certain moral principles. But neither explains why an agent has reason to abide by the duties prescribed by the moral principles. An agent would have such a reason insofar as they either (1) have natural sympathy with the welfare of others (meaning the reasons that others hold would be reasons that they also hold), or (2) judge that their behavior should be consistent with the norms they endorse.

## Objectivity

Morality is rationally optional, but this doesn't diminish its authority:

- Contingent on our interests:
	- Nearly universal: most people interested in impartial/social reasons, having a system of norms regulating blame.
	- Emphasizes the negotiation aspect: people cant just have independent that they claim are objective with no consideration of other person's reasons.
	- Other analogues: Scientific reasons are impartial/social reasons for belief (and thus evidentially optional), but that doesn't diminish its authority.
- Not externally necessarily justifiable, like all normative domains
	- Deduction/induction/abduction/evidence/science cannot be reasonable to someone who doesn't care for those forms of reasoning

There are no judgment-independent standards of moral truth, but that's a good thing:

- People cannot just come with arbitrary principles and claim them as the moral virtues.
- They are forced to take into account the interests of others.
- They are forced to make their demands reasonable to others. 
- Moral reasoning is a process of negotiation rather than of discovery.
