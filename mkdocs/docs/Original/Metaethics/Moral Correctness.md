# Moral Correctness

## Kinds of moral norms

(Descriptive) Non-naturalism and (descriptive) naturalistic asentimentalism are bogus.

Sentimentalism and constructivism are promising.

### Sentimental versus Constructive

Two kinds of moral reasons and two different standards of truth

1. Sentimental morality (aesthetic): truth predicated on the appropriateness of moral attitudes. This will be rational sentimentalism (assuming there is anything constituitive of moral attitudes) or dispositionalism. This emphasizes the *expressive* role of moral feelings.
	- Insofar as moral judgments are expressive of one's attitudes (think: X is disgusting!), they can have standards of correctness to determine whether one has reason to hold the attitude in question. This works the same as standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments in general, and for reasons in general (e.g. perhaps by appealing to the refined attitudes that would be had by the speaker if he were more informed and idealized). There no objective standards on this form of moral judgment, as there are no objective standards of correctness for aesthetic judgments. 

2. Constructivist morality: truth predicated not on the appropriateness of moral *attitudes*, but on the standards implicit in moral *discussion*. Implicit in moral discussion is that the considerations that each parties presents counts as *reasons* for the other party to take into account. This emphasizes the *prescriptive* role of moral arguments.
	- Insofar as moral judgments are tools to shape the attitudes of others ("Don't do X" or "shame the behavior of X"), the standards of correctness reduce to the reasons that other agents have to obey the prescriptions, i.e. to refrain from doing X or to shaming the doing of X. These would have to be not just reasons as such, but reasons contingent upon a goal of establishing a system of norms to coordinate the behavior of others in society. This would be objective standards of correctness for this form of moral judgments, as there is a fixed goal the promotion of which has objective right answers. Without this fix, we wouldn't have an objective standard of correctness and we would all have different reasons.

### Aesthetic versus Justice

1. Aesthetic morality: 
- This is a system for evaluating actions generally. 
- Judgments can be given either a constitutivist or dispositionalist analysis, found in all human cultures/societies.
- The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise. 
- On one reading, the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent). Thus, this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). Probably in line with the constitutivist analysis. This may be relative to contingent sensibilities.
- On another reading, these emotions have no constitutive meaning per se. They are mere tools to regulate society. As such, these emotions are warranted insofar as they promote the good of society (just as with individual rationality), i.e. positive states of consciousness, etc. The good of society should also be constrained in some way by consideration of the interests of the agents who are issued duties. Otherwise, those agents would have no reason to accept moral norms, but it is assumed that all agents have reason to be moral.
- Sits somewhere between ettiquette and justice, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette. 
- If a moral statement is true in this sense for a person, then they would be motivated to respect its law if they were informed/rational.
- Based on positive/negative states of consciousness.

2. Justice morality: 
- This is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as aesthetic morality.
- Judgments can be given a constructivist analysis, not necessarily found in all human cultures/societies.
- The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). 
- This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority. 
- Moral statements might be true in this sense, but a person need not have any motivation or even reason to respect its law in any particular circumstances (even if they were fully informed/rational). They might have a reason, however, to support the construction of rules which society agrees to respect contingent upon an interest for such rules.
- Based on liberty, not any states of consciousness.

### Kinds of reasons

Three types of reasons in favor of a norm:

1. Private consequentialist: Consequentialist reason to follow the norm; depends on personal interests that would be promoted by the individual following the norm. 
	- Basic prudential reasons.
	- This can include the pleasure that one feels from the satisfaction of the following consistency: one knows that they have public constructive reason to support norm X that mandates behavior Y. So they support X. This doesn't entail a prudential reason to do X, but most people would do it because of a natural desire to be consistent.
	- This also includes the pleasure that arises from natural sympathy with others. People feel good treating others nicely.
2. Private constitutive: Constitutive reason to follow the norm (i.g. "right" kind of reason); depends on personal, contingent sentiments, etc. a la secondary qualities. I think describes ettiquette, morality and aesthetics. If true reasons, people will be motivated to respect it in particular circumstances.
3. Public constructive: Reason to support societal construction of the norm; depends on desire to live in a certain sort of society with certain accepted rules. Can apply to people regardless of personal sentiments. I think describes forceful morality (i.e. justice, law) and possibly aeshtetic morality and ettiquette. People might not be motivated to respect it in any particular circumstance, but they will be motivated to support it as a rule that society agrees to respect.

## Constructivism

Moral propositions are not true based on some *correspondence*. We *construct* moral truth.

The framework
1. Constructive
2. Implicit commitments
3. Communicative commitments
4. Impartiality 
5. Reasons for everyone to accept ...

Now, there is no reason for an action that is not the rational extension of an agent's desires, ends, goals, etc. So there can be no morality that provides reasons independent of contingent aims, goals, etc. This is fine. Science works like this as well. Moral reasons are reasons that follow contingent on certain ends. There is no way to 100% motivate someone to be moral, nor is there a way to cateogrically guarantee the rationality of morality. The question is, what are the ends that are constituitive of morality? It is important that we do not arbitrarily choose certain ends that seem favorable, as there would be no basis for this. We cannot choose ends that are constituitive of a moral *feeling* or *judgment*, as there are no restrictions implicit in such an emotion. Instead, we look to moral *argument* and moral *discussion* and find what is implicit in such discussions.

### Communicative Commitments

Standards of correctness. Some examples:
* Explicit: if someone says "X is P", then we can look at the *content* of that proposition to determine some standards of correctness. E.g. if we were to also say "X is not P", then by merely looking at the *content*, we could deduce that the proposition must be incorrect.
* Hard Implication: if someone were to speak "I am not speaking", we could not look purely at the *content* of the proposition to determine whether it were false. If we know nothing about a person, then such a proposition could be true or false. Instead, we look at the *assertion* of the statement, whether than the *content* of the statement, to determine that the statement must be false.
* Soft Implication: in moral discussion, the *issuing* of a moral command implies that the receiver has reason to follow the rule. 
	- What's implicit in *moral* discussion
	- Discussions generally?
	- Negotiations?

Communicative principles in other domains

1. We can no longer look internally at the merely systematizing the judgments themselves. Because there can be conflicting internally coherent systems. 
2. We look to the meaning of the terms used and the context in which they are used. Normative terms like "right", "wrong", "good", "bad", "ought", etc. are all constructive. They only make sense with reference to an agent with specific goals and ends.
3. Examples: 
	- Prudential Rationality: there are no independent standards for bodily movements. But insofar as one is deliberative and reflective and evaluates their own actions, i.e. one is a rational agent, there are standards for behavior.
	- Games: there are no independent standards for moving small pieces across a checkered board. But insofar as one is playing chess, there are constituitive standards of the activity that entail standards of correctness.
	- Relationships: there are no independent standards of kindness, respect, loyalty, etc. with regard to how to treat others. But insofar as one is being a friend, partner or other normatively-laden relationships, there are constituitive standards of the activity that entail standards of behavior.
	- Communication: there are no independent standards of speaking or language. But insofar as one is communicating as a means to transfer ideas to someone else, there are standards of correctness.
	- Conversation: To engage in a *discussion* or *conversation* with someone, one implies that they will listen to the other party, not cut them off, etc. even though there may be no independent reason to do thees things. 
	- Negotiation: To engage in a *negotiation* implies that people are willing to sacrifice or deviate from their most preferred plan to help satisfy the interests of others. Now, one might have no reason to do these things (i.e. if they had full power), but then they wouldn't be negotiating. They would be bad negotiators. 
	- Morality: there are no independent standards of behavior. But insofar as one is engaged in moral argument as a procedure for finding *impartial reasons*, or reasons that all can accept, there are constituitive standards of correctness.

### Moral commitments

Impartiality: Moral reasons can be distinguished from practical reasons in that the moral reasons are reasons for action with some impartiality constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief).

- Moral norms = individual practical reasons that everyone has.
	- Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
	- There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals, metaphysical egoism is false.
- Moral norms = reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness equally. 
	- Maximizing the total utility of everyone (e.g. utilitarianism).
	- Personal reasons a person has under the veil of ignorance.
- Moral norms = norms no one could reasonably reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation given that one has such a desire.

Note that personal reasons a person has under the veil of ignorance =/= norms no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed cooperation. The difference is that the former is concerned with individual, personal reasons that just so happen to be constrained with regard to information, whereas the latter are characteristically impartial, social reasons. E.g. even though it is rational to accept a system under the veil of ignorance that left everyone great except for one person who sufferred immensely, it would be rational for that one person to reject thoes norms as a basis for cooperation given a desire for cooperation.

Implications of A advocating for a norm in moral discussion:
- (Regulative) A thinks the the norm should regulate our actions, our societal standards for shame/praise, and individual standards for guilt/pride. 
- (Negotiative) A is willing to negotiate to cooperate and coordinate plans.
- (Impartial) A thinks the norm applies to everyone, including himself.
- (Individual Motivational) A *is disposed to* regulate his behavior as prescribed by the norm.
- (Individual Rationality) A *thinks that he has reason to* regulate his behavior as prescribed by the norm.
- (Communal Motivation) A thinks others are *capable* of being motivated to regulate their behavior in accord with the norm; they are capable of being receptive to the reasons favoring the norm. E.g. while it might make sense for A to *dislike* B's preference for ice crean, it doesn't make sense for A to *disapprove* of B's preference for ice cream, but it would make sense it B regarded A as his dietary adviser. This is true even when B's actions might harm A. E.g. it doesn't make sense for A to disapprove of B's attack against him if B would be completely unreceptive (e.g. animal, child, evil person, alien,s etc.), but it would make sense for someone who was receptive (i.e. normal rational agent).
- (Communal Reason) A thinks others have *reason to* regulate their behavior in accord with the norm.

Two polarities regarding moral reasons:
1. Internal vs External: moral reasons cannot just be reduced to prudential reasons, since that would be like a bribe. But they also cannot be just reasons that derive from the institution of morality, since that would be not a genuine reason.
2. Personal vs Impartial: moral reasons cannot discount the interests of an individual, as then it would be irrational for one to accept them. But they also must be impartial.

Possible Standards
- To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
- This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

Conclusions:
- A norm is must be immoral if it neglects the fully rational interests of any particular agent.
- A norm cannot be moral if it it meets the fully rational interests of every agent.
- Hard question: how to handle norms that harm some and help others.

### Other communicative/societal constraints

Communicative constraints regarding reasons for belief and/or conversations/arguments generally.
- Burden of proof depends on the speaker who asserts a claim, not on the mere content of the proposition. That someone asserts a claim has a burden of proof cannot be entailed from the content of the propositions expressed. When Mike says "God Exists", it follows that he has reason to follow the rule, even though this reason is not trivially included in the rational extension of his motivational set for beliefs.
- Even though an anecdotal experience might provide one with a personal reason for belief, it would not provide everyone with a reason for belief (e.g. a scientific reason).
- How to know what the standards are? We check what would happen if everyone accepted it. If no one accepted a burden of proof, the central goal of argument would be defeated.
- Don't interrupt others, cut them off, etc. Listen to them.

## Sentimentalism

Two classes of moral attitudes:
1. Generic attitudes of approval/disapproavl
2. Specific natural emotions: anger, guilt, shame, etc.

Non-cognitive features of generic attitudes:
- *Expressive*: Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
- *Prescriptive*: Moral attitudes are tools for modifying social behavior.

Specific Natural Emotions:
- While some natural emotions (e.g. fear) have specific constitutive conditions for their appropriateness, it seems moral emotions might not. E.g. the appropriateness of anger can not be understood in purely non-normative terms; fear is appropriate only when someone has been wronged.

### Simple Subjectivism

Too simple

### Dispositionalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X is such as to elicit R in circumstances c. The circumstances C can be given several formulations such as, e.g., normal circumstances.

This is similar to the truth conditions for when an entity is a certain color. I.e. X is red if and only if X is such as to elicit the perception of redness in normal humans under normal circumstances.

This will not work for moral terms because:

1. It cannot be used to criticize conventional moral responses.
2. It doesn't explain why one's evaluative judgments influence their emotional response, whereas one's judgments about color concepts don't influence their color perceptions. 
3. It doesn't explain why moral truth can be discovered a priori under reflection, whereas truth about color concepts cannot.

This may be improved by focusing on *idealized* circumstances rather than *normal* circumstances.

### Rational Sentimentalism

To judge that X is morally wrong is to judge that one has reason to feel emotional response R with regard to X. One has reason to feel R with regard to X if and only if X has the properties ascribed by the emotional response R. 

For example, to fear X involves some sort of perception that it is dangerous. This is constitutive of fear, and there is clear evolutionary reason to develop such a psychological faculty. One has reason, then, to fear X if and only if X is dangerous. Moral emotions, e.g. blame, resentment, guilty, etc., are emotions like that.

This is kind of siimilar to "thick" ethical concepts, except with sentimentalism the attitudes are guiding the correct application of the concepts as opposed to the concepts being constructed in a way that picks out certain features.

## Notes on Objectivity

Morality is rationally optional, but this doesn't diminish its authority:

- Contingent on our interests:
	- Nearly universal: most people interested in impartial/social reasons, having a system of norms regulating blame.
	- Emphasizes the negotiation aspect: people cant just have independent that they claim are objective with no consideration of other person's reasons.
	- Other analogues: Scientific reasons are impartial/social reasons for belief (and thus evidentially optional), but that doesn't diminish its authority.
- Not externally necessarily justifiable, like all normative domains
	- Deduction/induction/abduction/evidence/science cannot be reasonable to someone who doesn't care for those forms of reasoning

There are no judgment-independent standards of moral truth, but that's a good thing:

- People cannot just come with arbitrary principles and claim them as the moral virtues.
- They are forced to take into account the interests of others.
- They are forced to make their demands reasonable to others. 
- Moral reasoning is a process of negotiation rather than of discovery.
