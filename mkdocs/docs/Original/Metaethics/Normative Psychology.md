# Normative Psychology

## The Deliberative Perspective

Intentional action can be explained from two perspectives, the *intentional* and the *deliberative*. From the intentional perspective, intentional action can be explained by citiing *motivating reasons*, i.e. by citing a belief-desire pair that fits into a pattern of teleological explanation. From the deliberative perspective, intentional action can be explained by citing *normative reasons*, i.e. by citing a pattern of rational deliberation that either did, or could have, produced it. This involves citing the considerations that one reflects over in deciding what to do. 

The deliberative perspective must be explanatory because when we decide what to do after deliberation, that often makes a difference in what we do. This would be impossible if the deliberative perspective were not explanatory, since the connection between deliberation and our action would be purely causally contingent. Thus, our attitudes towards the propositions that figure in our deliberations must be capable of figuring an explanation of our action. However, there must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action and the agent's motivating reasons for action.

Vaguely, to judge that one has normative reason to X is to *endorse* X under deliberation. Normative judgments then can be vaguely characterized as *deliberative endorsement* of some propositional content. Contrast this with undeliberative or unreflective endorsement, which are the sources of one's *motivating reasons*, the explanation of their intentional behavior. The question is to determine what it is to form deliberative endorsement of an action. Is it a desire, belief of some sort, etc.

## Competing Analyses

### World-to-mind-fit

Currently, these just include desires. Desires are states with a functional, dispositional role. To desire to D is to be disposed to X in conditions where they believe they can D by X-ing.

> To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X.

.
> To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X in the proper psychological state (i.e. tests of reflection and experience, free of various psychological disturbances, etc).

.
> To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire to desire X.

Might there be other forms of world-to-mind fit not adequately characterized as a desire? Goals and preferences seem to be a distinctive form of world-to-mind fit. Deliberative endorsements might also be a unique form of world-to-mind fit. It seems like the distinction between desires and goals and similar to the distinction between desires and values.

- Desire X = disposition to voluntarily M in conditions where one believes M -> X.
- Prefer X = desire X and is conscious of this desire.
- Goal X = Conscious endorsement of X.
- Value X = Deliberative endorsement of X.

### Mind-to-world fit 

Currently, these include just counterfactual beliefs about one's desires:

> To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed.

.
> To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed and fully rational. 

#### Fully Rational

To serve as a useful analysis, fully rational must be given a reductive account, i.e. in explaining what it is to judge that one has a normative reason, we should not have to refer back to an unexplained normative judgment. some components of rationality include the following:

- The agent holds no false beliefs and all relavent true beliefs.
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).
- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Uusing imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
- Being free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Systematically unified desires.

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms. Otherwise, it doesn't really illuminate what normativity reasons consist in. Michael Smith's characterization does make use of normative terms (he thinks the concept of "unity" and "truth" is normative), but this is because his account of rationality is irreductive.

## My Position

Plattitudes:

- Ubiquity - Linguistic flexibility. Normative judgments can be expressed in a variety of different ways, "X is wrong", "we ought not do X", "Boo X!", "X is disgusting", "X is crappy", "we must not do X", "don't do X!", etc. It is unlikely that the referrents of the terms in each of these expressions are descriptive of the same entity. More likely, they are expressive of a certain motivating attitude in the being. 
- Judgment Internalism: A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational. Required for a few reasons: (1) the capacity to form normative judgments would not have been evolutionarily advantageous if they were not linked to motivation, (2) the normative judgments a person made would not matter if they were not linked to motivation; rather, it would be whatever those judgments were that were linked to motivation (which would should be termed REAL normative judgments).
- Disagreement: two distinct descriptions of a subjective state of mind cannot explain why people disagree over normative judgments.

Requirements for a descriptivist theory:

- Must be in some way descriptive of our attitudes to be motivating
- Must not be too tied to our actual attitudes to allow for internal criticism and external criticism
- Must not be reduced to non-normative idealized circumstances, to prevent ....

A descriptivist analysis of moral judgments is possible only if it has the following components (attitude-dispositionalist theory).

- Attitudinal: They must related to properties tied to normative attitudes. E.g. "X is good" means "X has attitude-independent property Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y" could work.
- Internal Criticism: They must allow for coherent questioning of one's present attitudes. E.g. "X produces attitude Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y under normal circumstances" could work.
- Non-reductive (maybe): The ideal conditions must not be purely non-normative. E.g. "X produces attitude Y under typical circumstances" will not work. But "X produces Y under ideal, rational circumstances" could work.

The attitudes which are diposed can be variable: desires, resentment, etc. Other dispositional theories do not work. E.g. moral language dispositionalism doesn't work (i.e. the properties that are causally responsible for our usage of the terms 'good' and 'right', etc.) because the causes of our moral terms are completely arbitrary social conventions. Also, we wouldn't be able to analyze the moral terms of a foreign language. Theories which aren't even dispositional (e.g. objective theories) are not plausible. 

Instead, normative judgments could be expressive of a non-cognitive state, which are attitudes with the following characteristics:

- Relation between desiring and valuing.
- Similarities
    - Have propositional content, i.e. value/desire that p be the case, unlike bare sensations.
    - Have a mind-to-world fit, i.e. dispositional rather than representational nature.
    - Desires explain intentions. Insofar as we are rational, values explain intentions.
- Differences
    - Desires explain intentional action, can be unreflective. Values are the upshots of deliberation. Reflective endorsement.
    - Desires are present in all animals that perform intentional actions, values only in animals with metacognition. Desires require intention. Values require thoughts about intentions.
    - Desires can conflict with values. What might not value what we desire. We might not desire what we value. 
    - Valuing can have constitutive constraints.
- Possible analysis:
    - Valuing X = some form of reflective/deliberative endorsement. What is a reflective/deliberative endorsement? Neither belief nor desire.
    - Valuing X = Desiring to desire X. 
    - Valuing X = Believing that X would be desired if one were fully rational/informed. It may possible that this is compatible with the judgment internalism thesis (as a person would be moved to desire what they believed they would desire if they were fully rational/informed, insofar as they are rational), but there are still two issues:
        - If the theory is non-reductive (i.e. doesn't reduce what it is to judge something rational), then it does not accomplish the primary goal of (naturalistic) normative analysis, which is to explain what it is to form a normative judgment in the first place. Surely, an analysis cannot be informative it does the following analysis: to judge that X is good is to believe that one would desire X if one were good. Any judgment about what A means when A makes a normative judgment cannot rely on A's making a normative judgment.
        - If the theory is reductive, i.e. judging something rational is to believe XYZ, then it could have just used XYZ as the analysis to begin with.
    - Valuing X = Believing that X would be desired if one had unqualified cognitive/imaginitive powers and full factual/nomological information. This may also be compatible with the judgment internalism thesis, but:
        - Even though its sufficient to invoke a normative judgment, it doesn't seem necessary. This is not what we're doing when we make normative judgments. 
    - (general criticism) Valuing X = X would be desired if one were rational
        - These might give the correct truth conditions, but they miss the point.
        - When someone rationally endorse X, they aren't thinking about what they would desire in such and such circumstances.
