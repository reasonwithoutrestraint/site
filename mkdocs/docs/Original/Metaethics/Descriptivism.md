# Descriptivism

## Some requirements for descriptivism

1. Must explain how the normative supervenes on the non-normative.
2. Must explain how a mind-to-world-fit state of mind can produce a mind-to-world fit sate of mind.
3. If there are normative facts, then either the normative facts need to somehow explain our normative judgments or else normative facts must consist in our (hypothetical or idealized) normative judgments. Otherwise, there would be no causal connection bewteen our normative judgments, on the one hand, and the normative facts, on the other. That would mean we could have no justification for any of our normative judgments, because in order to have justified belief in p, it must be the case that one's belief in p is reliably explained by the fact that p (e.g. the perception that the Earth is not moving is not evidence that the Earth is not moving, because that perception is not better explained by the fact that the Earth is not moving).
4. Attitude-independent theories of normative facts would have to posit that the normative facts are ontologically prior to our normative judgments, but nevertheless explain our normative judgments. This seems impossible under non-naturalism. Under naturalism, it gets more complicated.
5. Attitude-dependent theories of normative facts must not reduce normative facts to our actual attitudes, as this would prevent disconnections between our actual attitudes and our normative judgments, and it would also preclude coherent questioning of one's actual attitudes. Cannot be the basis of moral judgments because that would prevent coherent moral disagreement assuming all partiies were fully rational.

## General Problems

General problems with ignoring non-descriptive attitudes

### Considerations favoring non-descriptivism

*The dynamic meaning of judgments*. Consider two uses of the same term with the same descriptive content but with different meaning, e.g. using "gay" purely descriptively versus derogatorily. Now consider two different terms with the same meaning but whereby one has the dynamic content implicitly associated with it, e.g. "skinny" versus "bony".

*Analogy with other judgments* Give examples of other clearly non-descriptive expressions that have been encoded in descriptive form: movie X was greater than Y, etc. 

*Descriptivism unnecessary*. all of our normative discourse can be explained without appeal to the existence of normative entities, or judgments about such properties. 

### Arguments against descriptivism

*Motivational*. Once can infer that an agent has a world-to-mind fit state of mind with respect to X if they judge that they have normative reason to X. This is easy to explain if judgments of normative reasons are themselves world-to-mind fits. If judgments of normative reasons are mind-to-world fit (under descriptivism), it is more difficult to explain how a mind-to-world-fit state of mind can produce a mind-to-world fit sate of mind.

*Descriptivism cannot account for dynamic account of normative terms*. No descriptive theory can account for the dynamic meaning of evaluative expressions. Think of how we distinguish between moral uses of moral terms versus non-moral uses, e.g. "right" as used in "morally right" versus "economically right", "good" as used in "morally good" versus "economically good", etc. The characteristic feature of the moral uses are to be found in the non-descriptive attitude expressed or in the intended modification of the listener's attitudes.

*Flexibility of language*. A ought to X, A needs to X, A must X, X is crappy, X is disgusting, etc. can all mean the same thing. Best explained as prescriptions and/or expressions, rather than reports/descriptions. It is unlikely that the referrents of the terms in each of these expressions are descriptive of the same entity, and if they were, then how would we know?

*Normative education/expressions*. We teach children to form certain moral judgments by molding their non-descriptive attitudes; and this is done by rewarding/punishing behavior with various non-descriptive attitudes, and by showing examples of appropriate attitudes in certain circumstances.

*Splitting descriptivism and non-descriptivism*. Take a descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that ascriptions of goodness to x express belief p to x. Take a non-descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that such ascriptions express non-descriptivist attitude q to x. Imagine an agent held q with regard to x but they did not hold p with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they judge x to be good. Now imagine that they held p with regard to x but they did not hold q with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they don't judge to be good.
