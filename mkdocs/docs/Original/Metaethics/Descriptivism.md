# Descriptivism

## Key features of Normativity

- Ubiquitous - 
- Disagreement (especially with morality) regardless of empirical agreement or linguistic/societal differences
- Rational/Deliberative - a priori
- Motivational - world to mind fit that sometimes conflicts with other motivations
- Supervenience - normative properties supervene on the natural properties

## Requirements for descriptivism

1. Must explain how the normative supervenes on the non-normative.
2. Must explain how a mind-to-world-fit state of mind can produce a mind-to-world fit sate of mind.
3. If there are normative facts, then either the normative facts need to somehow explain our normative judgments or else normative facts must consist in our (hypothetical or idealized) normative judgments. Otherwise, there would be no causal connection bewteen our normative judgments, on the one hand, and the normative facts, on the other. That would mean we could have no justification for any of our normative judgments, because in order to have justified belief in p, it must be the case that one's belief in p is reliably explained by the fact that p (e.g. the perception that the Earth is not moving is not evidence that the Earth is not moving, because that perception is not better explained by the fact that the Earth is not moving).
4. Attitude-independent theories of normative facts would have to posit that the normative facts are ontologically prior to our normative judgments, but nevertheless explain our normative judgments. This seems impossible under non-naturalism. Under naturalism, it gets more complicated.
5. Attitude-dependent theories of normative facts must not reduce normative facts to our actual attitudes, as this would prevent disconnections between our actual attitudes and our normative judgments, and it would also preclude coherent questioning of one's actual attitudes. Cannot be the basis of moral judgments because that would prevent coherent moral disagreement assuming all partiies were fully rational.

## General Problems

General problems with ignoring non-descriptive attitudes

### Understanding non-descriptivism

*The dynamic meaning of judgments*. Consider two uses of the same term with the same descriptive content but with different meaning, e.g. using "gay" purely descriptively versus derogatorily. Now consider two different terms with the same meaning but whereby one has the dynamic content implicitly associated with it, e.g. "skinny" versus "bony".

*Examples of other domains of non-descriptive judgments*. E.g. aesthetics, tastes, etc.

*Necessity of non-descriptive judgments.* We would have needed to develop a system for expressing attitudes of approval, disapproval, and also for modifying the attitudes of others.

### Normativity doesn't require descriptivism

*Normative education/expressions*. We teach children to form certain moral judgments by molding their non-descriptive attitudes; and this is done by rewarding/punishing behavior with various non-descriptive attitudes, and by showing examples of appropriate attitudes in certain circumstances.

*Flexibility of language*. A ought to X, A needs to X, A must X, X is crappy, X is disgusting, etc. can all mean the same thing. Best explained as prescriptions and/or expressions, rather than reports/descriptions. It is unlikely that the referrents of the terms in each of these expressions are descriptive of the same entity, and if they were, then how would we know?

*Descriptivism unnecessary*. all of our normative discourse can be explained without appeal to the existence of normative entities, or judgments about such properties.

### Arguments against Realism

*Motivational*. Once can infer that an agent has a world-to-mind fit state of mind with respect to X if they judge that they have normative reason to X. With moral judgments, this is particularly true if they *exclaim* that a certain action is (im)moral. This is easy to explain if judgments of normative reasons are themselves world-to-mind fits. Otherwise, this is difficult to explain. Attributions of goodness to P have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any (non-)naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are *necessarily* action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only *contingently* action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.

### Arguments against all Descriptivism

*Descriptivism cannot discern "positive" versus "descriptive" uses of normative terms*. Think of how we distinguish between moral uses of moral terms versus non-moral uses, e.g. "right" as used in "morally right" versus "economically right" or "conventionally right", "good" as used in "morally good" versus "economically good", etc. The characteristic feature of the moral uses are to be found in the non-descriptive attitude expressed or in the intended modification of the listener's attitudes.

*Role of attitudes in ethical disagreement*. Descriptivism cannot explain the role of attitude in ethical disagreements. There are two forms of disagreement, disagreements in belief (when both cannot be true) and disagreement in attitudes (when both cannot be satisfied). Note that reducing ethical judgments to *beliefs about attitudes* cannot account for this. If A believes he desires X and B believes he desires not-X, then these beliefs are not in disagreement because they can both be true. Ethical disagreements commonly feature disagreements in attitudes and in beliefs. But attitudes play the primary role because (1) disagreements in attitudes determine which beliefs are relevant, and (2) ethical disagreement persist after agreement in belief. It might be said that this is actually a disagreement in beliefs about each agent's idealized attitudes, where idealized attitudes are assumed to be convergent. But this doesn't work either. Ethical disagreement can persist despite agreement about the beliefs of everyone's fully rational, fully informed attitudes (i.e. free of psychological compulsions, emotional disturbances, physical addictions, etc.). In fact, if people currently disagreed in attitudes, but agreed in all beliefs (including about counterfactual attitudes under full rationality/information), then there would be still be an ethical disagreement. This is not the cause with something like think art, humor, taste, etc.

*Splitting descriptivism and non-descriptivism*. Take a descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that ascriptions of goodness to x express belief p to x. Take a non-descriptivist theory of normative judgment which says that such ascriptions express non-descriptivist attitude q to x. Imagine an agent held q with regard to x but they did not hold p with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they judge x to be good. Now imagine that they held p with regard to x but they did not hold q with regard to x. It seems safe to say that they don't judge to be good.

## Specific Problems

Here is an outline of the normative failures of various descriptivist theories

- Non-naturalistic Realism 
    - Supervenience - how can distinct properties be necessarily coextensive?
    - Motivation - how can perceiving of some non-natural properties motivate someone
    - Rational/deliberative - how do we *a priori* *perceive* supervening properties? 
    - Uniquitous - can't explain why normative judgments would be so everpresent in our psychology given their causal inefficacy
    - Other general philosophical problems with non-naturalism
- Analytic Naturalism
    - General
        - Open Question Argument, Insistence on Normative Language, 
        - Normative judgments are just tautologies
        - Explain persisting disagreement despite empirical agreement 
        -> Explain why the normative instance of the paradox of analysis differs from other cases...normative judgments are supposed to provide reasons for action. In other cases, we would be fine to abandon the terms being analyzed (i.e. no problem switching from "knowledge" to "justified true belief"). But not in the moral case. 
    - Realism
        - Motivation - how can perceiving of some non-natural properties motivate someone
    - Anti-Realism
        - Disagreement - how can two subjective persons contradict each other given differing attitudes
        - ??? an idealized version may be able to work in the non-moral case
- Synthetic Naturalism (Corenell Realism)
    - Rational/deliberative - how can we learn about normative truths a priori?
    - Disagreement - how can we contradict beings from societies where there were different causal explanations for their usage of normative terms
