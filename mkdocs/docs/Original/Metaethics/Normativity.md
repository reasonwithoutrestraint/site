# Normativity

## Normative Plattitudes

The following features are constituitive of normative judgments:

1. **Supervenience**: normative judgments supervene on non-normative beliefs. If one has a competent grasp of normative concepts, then if they judge two things to be different normatively then this must be due to a judged difference in non-normative properties. Equivalently, once one's beliefs about the non-normative properties of a thing is fixed, so too are his normative judgments about the thing.
2. **Deliberative**: argumentation/reasoning influences our normative judgments. Our judgments of normative reason are typically the upshots of deliberation, whereas our motivating reasons can be a given [Supplement with Smith's elaboration on the deliberative and the intentional]. 
3. **Ubiquitous**: normative judgments are found in all creatures who deliberate, insofar as those deliberations influence action [Supplement with Korsgaard's contrast of animals and humans].
4. **Motivational**: normative judgments influence action. Judging that one has normative reason to do x is typically associated with a motivating reason to do x. But this is not perfect: there are cases where one judges that they have normative reason to do x without having a corresponding motivating reason to do x, and there are cases where one has a motivating reason to do x without a corresponding judgment that they have normative reason to do x. Think of cases of psychological compulsion, physical addiction or emotional disturbances. Such cases are usually not the norm; an explanation of some such sort must be invoked to explain not intending what one judges to have reason to do [Supplement on Smith's elaboration of the deliberative and the intentional, Gibbard's evolutionary arguments for the value of motivational content, also with some considerations about translations from other cultures, and sincere inferences of normative judgments of others].
5. **Disagreement**: people disagree about certain normative matters, particularly with regard to morality. If one agent morally judges that x is to be done, and another judges that x is not to be done, these are inconsistent judgments [Supplement with Stevenson's note on disagreement].

Showing these plattitudes:

1. See Korsgaard's work: animals believe what they perceive, and act based on their desires. Humans don't just take perceptions and desires at face-value; we reason and think about whether these perceptions/desires justify beliefs/actions. There is a cognitive, conscious process of normative reasoning standing between perceptions/desires and actions. This is normative reason. This doesn't necessarily commit me to saying that normative truth consists in what is entailed from this, but only that we all participate in normative reasoning. Normative truth might, e.g. consist in what is entailed from normative reason under proper conditions.
2. All synthetic judgments beliefs stem from normative reasoning, either deductive reasoning (e.g. for a priori judgments) or inductive reasoning (e.g. for a posteriori judgments). Not only is there the normative approval or deductive/inductive reasoning as a form of reasoning, but also the normative judgment that particular propositions follow from inductive reasoning. E.g. a person might think they accept inductive reasoning for non-normative reasons; fine, but it is still a normative question whether a particular belief inductively follows in any non-trivial set of experiences.

## Normative Unification

### Semantic Form

All normative judgments can be expressed in the form of a prescription that recommends a particular behavior X for an agent A in circumstances. There are often expressed in declarative form via some relation that involves entities A, X, C. The basic terms underlying this relation can be any term that supports this relation grammatically, i.e. "A ought to X in circumstances C", "A has reason to X in circumstances C", "A is justified in X in circumstances C", "It is fitting for A to X in circumstances C", etc.

A normative system can be understood by the following components:

- T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.) - this constraints genuine normative statements to be action guiding in some way. Normative propositions that cannot be expressed in this manner are not coherent normative propositions.
- R - The considerations that serve as reasons for the norm. Different normative realms have different relavent considerations.
Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
- S - The actual norms of the normative system. These are entailed from whatever the relevant considerations are plus any observational content.

Other considerations concerning the content of normative judgments

- Right/Wrong kinds of reason
- Ought implies can & cannot
- Is/Ought gap -> logical/analytic/synthetic
