# Naturalism

This concerns *reductive* naturalism the view that contains the following components:

1. Normative concepts refer to normative properties (against non-cognitivism).
2. Normative properties can be reduced to entities which are the subject matter of physics (synthetic naturalism).
3. Normative properties can be reduced to non-normative properties (reductive synthetic naturalism) (optional).
4. Normative concepts can be reduced to non-normative concepts (analytic naturalism) (optional).

Forms of non-reductive naturalism, which deny 3 and 4 (e.g. David Brink and Nicholas Sturgeon), are edge cases not considered here.

## Analytic Naturalism

*Open Question Argument*. (1) Any proposed analytic reduction of a term must be uninformative and obvious. (2) Any analytic reduction of goodness would be informative and nonobvious. (3) Therefore, there can be no analytic reduction of moral terms. Consider the question "Is X good". Now, imagine that a proposed complex analysis of goodness states that all questions of the form 'Is X good' are questions of the form 'Does X have naturalistic property Y'. The problem with this is that, we can always further ask "Is it good that X has property Y". This further question is clearly intelligible and coherent. But, if goodness that could be analyzed in terms of Y, then such a question would not be intelligible.

Response: deny that all analytic reductions must be trivial and uninformative.

*Insistence on Normative Language*. If normative term N really meant natural term M, then why not carry on making claims about M? If the thesis were true, this would be equivalent to making claims about N, so there should be no difference. The fact that one chooses not to do so implies either (1) he believes that there really is something about N not captured in M, or (2) he believes that society believes that there is something about N not captured in M. Either way, either he or society believes that N and M are not analytically equivalent.

*Normativity reduced to Tautology*. While it may be appropriate for an analytic reduction to be nontrivial, it is not appropriate that an analytic reduction could ever provide one with a *reason* for action. If normative concept M can be analytically reduced to natural concept N, then saying "N is M" would be a tautology, and thus could provide no reason for action. For example, if goodness could be analytically reduced to pleasure, then if someone said "pleasure is good", then this would be equivalent to saying "pleasure is pleasure" or "goodness is goodness". But presumably the claim "pleasure is good" is supposed to provide someone with reason for action. But no tautology such as "pleasure is pleasure" or "goodness is goodness" could ever provide a reason or motive for someone to promote pleasure.

*Lack of Disagreement*. Imagine we can analytically reduce the meaning of a normative concept M to some natural concept. Imagine there are two persons/societies, A1 and A2. A1 reduces normative concept M to natural concept N1 and A2 reduces M to natural concept N2. When A1 ascribes M to an action or object, they are ascribing N1 to that action or object. And when A2 ascribes M to an action or object, they are ascribing N2 to that action or object. Let's also imagine that their ascriptions of M usually corresponds to a motivation. The result is that the two aren't really disagreeing with each other. Neither is expressing a representation of the world that is inconsistent with the others', and neither can acuse the other of a sort of inconsisteny or irrationality in their ascription of M, for these are arbitrarily decided analytic claims. However, it certainly seems plausible that the two can have substantive normative disagreements with one another.

### Agent Attitude Independent

*Lack of Normativity/Motivation*. Attributions of goodness to P have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are *necessarily* action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only *contingently* action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.

### Agent Attitude Dependent

#### Actual Attitudes

*Lack of normative-motivational failures*. There must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action (i.e. what they value) and the agent's motivating reasons for action (i.e. what they desire). A theory that merely reduces normative judgments to mere desires cannot account for this.

#### Moral Analysis

This concerns theories that analyze "X is morally good" in the form of one's (idealized, hypothetical, or actual) personal desires, preferences, sentiments, etc.

*Lack of Moral Disagreement*. Assume two people do agree that the meaning of moral terms reduces to some subjective account, e.g. "X is morally right" means "I approve of X" or "I desire X" or even "I would approve of X were I fully rational" (Where X is a determinate action). When these two people disagree about whether X is to be done, they aren't even disagreeing. One is saying "I desire doing X" and the other is saying "I do not desire doing X". But these are not incompatible claims. Even assuming they're making claims about their fully rational desires, and even assuming fully rational agents always formed the same desires in the same circumstances, these two claims would not necessarily be in conflict, since the differing *circumstances* of the two agents could justify having different desires. In general, a judgment that A do X, where predicating X is understood as a subjective belief, tends to vanish as one learns that A's reluctance to X is not caused by any sources of irrationally, i.e. free of psychological compulsions, emotional disturbances, physical addictions (think art, humor, taste, etc.). However, a judgment that A morally ought to X tends to persist despite learning that A's reluctance to X is not caused by irrationality.

#### Idealized or Hypothetical Attitudes

This may be satisfactory as a theory of the truth conditions of normative judgments. Its not clear if it meets the conceptual requirements. Note that this would have to be limited to judgments of rationality, not to moral judgments.

### Neo-Aristotelian


### Moral Functionalism


## Synthetic Naturalism

*A Priori Argument*. It seems we can come to learn about normative truths a priori. This is inexplicable if there is an a posteriori synthetic relationship between normative facts and non-normative facts. I.e. we cannot learn a priori that yellow is such and such wavelength, or that water is H2O. Yet how can it be the case that we can learn a priori that, e.g. some natural property *necessarily* co-instantiates a normative property? 

*Lack of Disagreement*. Synthetic identities can be found in other domains because we can easily fix the referrents of terms like "water" or "yellow", and then we can find that property that is always instantiated with that referrent. One strategy for doing this is to present a dispositional analysis: an entity is "yellow" just in case it causes sensation that we normally perceive as "yellow". Such a dispositional analysis is not promising for moral terms. Imagine that two societies are lingustically identical except when one society used the word "good" they referred to pleasure and the other society referred to God's will. On this reading, the two cultures wouldn't even disagree with each other, since the content of "good" in these two societies are different - they are using the same word to track different phenomenon. But it seems that these cultures can coherently disagree with each other, especailly if they each act in accordance with what is good.

### Cornell Realism

These take a *causal reference theory* for moral terms, because a causal reference theory is the standard theory of reference for natural kind terms. This rejects the *description theory of reference*. What determines whether a natural property is good is not whether it has the attributes ascribed to it by the term "good", but whether it causally regulates our use of the word "good". We are looking not at the semantic attribution behind the term, but rather at the properties causally responsible for that word. This is similar to how we use the word "health". When we say that someone is "healthy", it's unclear what the *meaning* of that might be. However, we can determine what property "healthy" *refers to* by finding what causally regulates our use of the term "health".

These arguments attack theories of the following form: A judges that he has normative reason to do X iff descriptive relation R holds involving A and X *because* of some contingent linguistic practice of his culture of his own personal definition, i.e. A judges that he has normative reason to do X iff he judges that X has the properties which causally explain our use of a "normative reason". Contrast this with analytic naturalistic theories that are not based on contingent linguistic conventions: e.g. A judges that he has normative reason to do X iff A believes that he would desire to do X if he were fully informed, consistent, etc. *because* this is constituitive of rational agency (regardless of any linguistic conventions).

*Translation Argument*. Imagine we wanted to translate another culture's language to our own. When translating our normative terms, we would be skeptical to attribute to them any normative terms if those terms did not usually accompany the corresponding motivation.
