## The Deliberative Perspective

*Maybe there is a third perspective, in between the deliberative and the intentional, the notion of a non-deliberative decision that does not manifest itself into an intention. For example, consider someone lying their bed who decides to grab a piece of cake to eat, but this doesn't manifest itself in the form of an intention because the person is too lazy. This would be a consciously endorsed desire, but not the active desire (i.e. intention). Further, we can imagine that this is not a deliberatively endorsed desire, if e.g. the person also believed that he shouldn't eat the cake.

Intentional action can be explained from two perspectives, the *intentional* and the *deliberative*. From the intentional perspective, intentional action can be explained by citiing *motivating reasons*, i.e. by citing a belief-desire pair that fits into a pattern of teleological explanation. From the deliberative perspective, intentional action can be explained by citing *normative reasons*, i.e. by citing a pattern of rational deliberation that either did, or could have, produced it. This involves citing the considerations that one reflects over in deciding what to do. 

The deliberative perspective must be explanatory because when we decide what to do after deliberation, that often makes a difference in what we do. This would be impossible if the deliberative perspective were not explanatory, since the connection between deliberation and our action would be purely causally contingent. Thus, our attitudes towards the propositions that figure in our deliberations must be capable of figuring an explanation of our action. However, there must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action and the agent's motivating reasons for action.

Vaguely, to judge that one has normative reason to X is to *endorse* X under deliberation. Normative judgments then can be vaguely characterized as *deliberative endorsement* of some propositional content. Contrast this with undeliberative or unreflective endorsement, which are the sources of one's *motivating reasons*, the explanation of their intentional behavior. The question is to determine what it is to form deliberative endorsement of an action. Is it a desire, belief of some sort, etc.

## Competing Analyses

### Dispositions

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to accept a system of norms that prescribe X-ing, i.e. be disposed to avow X in normative discussion.

### World-to-mind-fit

Note that world-to-mind fits are also dispositions. But they are different from general dispositions in that they consist of dispositions to realize or actualize a state of affairs, as opposed to, say, a disposition to avow or express a norm.

Desires are states with a functional, dispositional role. To desire to D is to be disposed to X in conditions where they believe they can D by X-ing.

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X.
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire X in the proper psychological state (i.e. tests of reflection and experience, free of various psychological disturbances, etc).
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to desire to desire X.

### Mind-to-world fit 

Currently, these include just counterfactual beliefs about one's desires:

- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed.
- To judge that one has normative reason to X is to believe that one would desire X if fully informed and fully rational. 

#### Fully Rational

To serve as a useful analysis, fully rational must be given a reductive account, i.e. in explaining what it is to judge that one has a normative reason, we should not have to refer back to an unexplained normative judgment. Some components of rationality include the following:

- The agent holds no false beliefs and all relavent true beliefs.
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).
- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
- Being free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Systematically unified desires.

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms. Otherwise, it doesn't really illuminate what normative reasons consist in. Michael Smith's characterization does make use of normative terms (he thinks the concept of "unity" and "truth" is normative), but this is because his account of rationality is irreductive.

## My Position

Some general requirements:

- Judgment Internalism: if A judges that they have normative reason to X, then this usually explains and produces a motivating reason to X.
- Normative Universalization: the account of normative reasons must apply to reasons for actions, beliefs, and attitudes. Conceivably, these are all attitudes for beliefs are attitudes and reasons for actions are usually characterized in terms of reasons for desires/intentions which are also attitudes. The reason the analysis should be universal is because when we endorse one class of attitudes (e.g. desires or intentions) under deliberation, this seems similar to when we endorse another (e.g. beliefs) under deliberation.

I endorse the world-to-mind fit conception, but I also consider mind-to-world fit possibilities.

### World-to-mind

Normative judgments, or deliberative endorsement, is a world-to-mind state of mind. This best explains why people who judge that they have normative reason to X are disposed to X. If it was a mere mind-to-world state of mind, then there would have to be some additional world-to-mind state of mind that explained why one's deliberation influences their motivation. 

However, it doesn't seem that they are best characterized as desires. It seems clear that normative judgments and desires can sometimes diverge. Might there be other forms of world-to-mind fit not adequately characterized as a desire? Goals and preferences seem to be a distinctive form of world-to-mind fit. And we can clearly understand how one might not have a desire to achieve one of their goals. It seems like the distinction between desires and goals and similar to the distinction between desires and values.

It seems like we can distinguish different world-to-mind fits based on their relationship to consciousness (thoughts) and deliberation (thoughts about thoughts). Types of world-to-mind attitudes with respect to propositional content X

- Dipsosition to involunarily X (involuntary action)
- Disposition to voluntarily X (voluntary reaction, habit)
- Disposition to voluntarily M where one believes M-> X (desire to X)
- Desire to X + awareness of the desire (preference to X)
- Conscious endorsement to X, regardless of desire (goal to X)

Might a goal to X adequately capture a judgment of normative reason? Does conscious endorsement of X amount to a deliberative endoresment of X? What is conscious endorsement? What is deliberative endorsement? Deliberative endorsement can be explained as conscious endorsement after deliberation. The question the is, what constitutes conscious endorsement?

### Candidates for a mind-to-world

A descriptivist analysis of normative judgments is possible only if it has the following components (attitude-dispositionalist).

- Attitudinal: They must related to properties tied to normative attitudes. E.g. "X is good" means "X has attitude-independent property Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y" could work.
- Internal Criticism: They must allow for coherent questioning of one's present attitudes. E.g. "X produces attitude Y" will not work. But "X is good" means "X produces attitude Y under particular (i.e. normal, preferred, ideal, etc.) circumstances" could work.
- Non-reductive (moral): The ideal conditions must not be purely non-normative. E.g. "X produces attitude Y under typical circumstances" will not work. But "X produces Y under ideal, rational circumstances" could work.

This may be able to satisfy the judgment internalism thesis. As a person would be motived to desire what they believed they would desire if they were fully rational/informed, insofar as they themselves are rational.

However, it doesn't seem that this is what we're doing when we deliberate. It seems we're figuring out what to do, we're searching for an answer to a practical problem, not trying to discover what we would do in some far off circumstances.

Further, there are two problems with general mind-to-world fit strategies:

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do. What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational. Smith thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent. But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis.
- They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A judges that he has normative reason to believe X in C iff he believes that an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A judges that he has normative reason to believe X iff he believes that an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.
