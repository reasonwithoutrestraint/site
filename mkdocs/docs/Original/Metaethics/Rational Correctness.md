# Rational Correctness

The Moral Problem

1. Rational: Moral duties provide agents with reason for action.
2. Categorical: Moral duties apply to all agents (some infer an independence of any agent's desires). 
3. Internalism: Practical reasons are necessarily dependent on desires.
4. Contingency: There are no necessary desires in all rational agents
5. Success Theory: There are moral truths.

Forms of truth:

## Alternative conceptions of truth

There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:

- Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal judgments:
- Probabilistic judgments:
- Causal judgments:
- Counterfactual judgments:

## Existence Internalism

According to existence internalism with regard to reasons: R is a normative reason for A to X iff R would be a motivating reason for A to X insofar as A is rational and A was aware of R. Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of sound rational deliberation. In other wrods, normative reasons are the rational extensions of one's motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is a sound deliberative route from an agent's motivational reasons to C. 

Everyone agrees that "sound deliberative route" requires that the deliberation not be based on false beliefs, but some give more substantive accounts as what counts as correct deliberation. Michael Smith, for example, appears eerily externalists in that he believes that he believes there are some non-self-defeating desires (e.g. considering only one's personal desires at the expense of everyone else's) that would not be held by fully rational creatures.

A plausible internalist cannot propose that one has reason to do X if and only if one would desire X under full information.

### Motivational Argument

One argument for internal reasons states that reasons must be capable of motivating action.

1. R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by
believing R insofar as A were fully rational.
2. A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if there is something in A’s motivational set that could bring A to be motivated to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in
A’s motivational set that could bring a fully rational A to be motivated to X
by believing R.
4. Therefore there are no external reasons.

Problems:
- "Fully Rational" may need to be explicitly characterized in terms of "sound deliberation" or somehting more substantive, so that (2) is not questionable. Otherwise, an externalist might say that (2) is false because part of what it is to be fully rational agent is to have certain element's in one's motivational set. But now an argument needs to be given as to why (1) should be accepted, i.e. why "sound deliberation" should be associated with responsiveness to reasons.
- Motivational set" cannot be as broad as "dispositions for behavior", becuase this would not exclude external reasons from existing in one's motivational set, i.e. an externalist could say that dispositions are just counterfactual motivations, and all agents have a dispositions to be motivated by external reasons because the would be motivated under the counterfactual where such reasons where in their motivational set. It needs to be restricted in a way that includes desires, values, goals, etc. but excludes anything that could be labelled 
"disposition". But then (2) would be assuming a Humean account of motivation.
- (2) depends on a Humean account of motivation. Also, the Humean account of motivation does not discount the possibility of sound deliberation producing new, underived desires (it's not clear whether this would count as an internal element or not), as the Humean theory is concerned with how belief and desire causally relate to action, not with how deliberation causally relates to desires.

General strategy
- Connect normative reasons and motivating reasons (usually via deliberation).
- Disconnect external reasons with motivating reasons.

### Explanatory Argument

Normative reasons are counterfactual explanatory reasons (Michael Smith w/out ideal observer).

1. R is a reason for A to X only if R could explain why a fully rational A would do X.
2. That A is motivated to X by believing R can be explained only by something in A’s motivational set that could motivate A to X by believing R.
3. If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in
A’s motivational set that motivate a fully rational A to be motivated to X
by believing R.
4. Therefore there are no external reasons.

Again, "fully rational" and "motivational set" cannot be given too weak interpretation, as this would not rule at external reasons statements without question-begging.

(1) should be accepted by considering the cases where we perform actions because of normative reasons. The times where there is a disconnect between our motivating and normative reasons, we can point to some sort of problem, either we aren't aware of the reasons, we have false information, we suffer from addition, etc. 

The reason that reasons statements are not based on the hypothetical motivational sets of a fully moral/rational A, i.e. A+, is because it is important that reasons statements apply directly to A. Note, however, that we can still focus on the somewhat idealized A who has deliberated, because we can infer that A already values the motivations of himself after he has deliberated. We can infer this from the fact that he is in fact deliberating. So he already values his deliberation.

But why should reasons statements for A be based on what he actually values in any present moment? This seems question-begging against the externalist. Two reasons (1) We make claims about reasons" for the purpose of influencing, motivating, or guiding agents. But the only thing that can guide agents (assuming they don't suffer from addictions, false beliefs, etc.) are elements from their motivational set. And (2) this is a basic premise of constructivism (see below).

### 

## Constructivism

See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street, (Bernard Williams?)

The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself. 

A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of *cannot* is not rational, but what is *constituitive* of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.

### Constituitive Features

The central question is how to determine what requirements are constitutive of a type of behavior. One candidate is this: a requirement is constituitive of a behavior if no agent could consciously reject the requirement in full awareness.

Logical Consistency. One basic constituitive feature of normative judgments (and thuoghts generally) is logical consistency. No person can consciously believe X and believe not-X in full awareness.

#### Epistemic

- Perceptions/memories: the reason that a perception that p provides one with reason to believe that p is because part of what it is to perceive p is to acquire an unreflective belief that p. If perceptions didn't provide one with an unreflective belief that p, then perceiving that p would be like imagining that p, and this would not provide one with a reason to believe p. Similar considerations apply to memories.
- Abduction: 
- Induction: 
- Causation: 

#### Prudential

- Desires: the reason that a desire to X tends to provide one with reason to X is (1) people tend to judge that they have reason to X if they desire to X, and (2) all intentional actions are done because of some desire; if they are not done because of a desire, then they would be involuntary actions. 
- Instrumental Reasoning: one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to X without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to X. Part of what it is to judge one has a reason to X consists of judging one to have a reason to adopt the means.
- Pain/Suffering: the reason that pain/suffering provides one with reason to avoid it is precisely because people judge that they have reason to avoid it (or they have an unreflective aversion towards it). If a person had no aversion toward pain and didn't judge that they had reason to avoid it, then there would be no actual reason to avoid it. It is not the pure sensation of pain that provides us with reason to avoid it. 

### Competing reasons

The most fundamental question is how to determine what one ought to do when there are some considerations that give one reason to X and some considerations that give one reason to not-X. This is especially important for moral considerations when weighing reasons from different agents.

## Human Theory of Rationality

The Humean theory of rationality states the following

A has a reason to X if and only if (1) X promotes A's desire d and (2) d is not based on any false beliefs. This can be simplified to: A has a reason to X if and only if X promotes a foundational (rather than derivative) desire in A.

This allows for only one form of criticism of an agent's desire - i.e. if the desire is based on a false belief. But there seems to be much more broader possibilities for rationally criticizing a desire. See below:

## Idealization

See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith, Firth, (Bernard Williams?)

There are two versions: *Ideal agent*: an agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of themselves, A+, would desire to X in C. *Ideal Observer*: an ideal agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. The idealization requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end-deliberation.

- Fully Information
- Fully Rational
    - Being free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
    - Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).
    - Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
    - Deciding which desires one places most weight.
    - Systematically unified desires.
- Fully Experienced (may violate internalism constraint)

### Fully Informed

*Observer-based not agent-based.* Note that the rationality of X does not reduce to whether A+ desires X. The rationality of X rather reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X. This is because doing otherwise could not cannot account for rationality under uncertainty. Consider the case when it is rational to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though there can be circumstances where doing so is rational. E.g. imagine someone finds themselves in the woods and they want to get out as soon as possible. The rational thing to do might be to do seek a person and ask for directions, find a map, etc. but this would not be desired by a being that already had full information.

It's not clear why this is enough to focus on observers rather than agents. For example, imagine the case where someone drinks a glass of soda that they believe to be water and they desire to drink water. We can easily say that they have reason to not drink from the glass, even though they do have reason to drink from the glass given the information that they have. In this case, there is no problem with saying someone has most reason to do something which they have no rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs. Likewise, it seems we can say that people don't actually have reason to seek information, but rather they have reason to seek information given their currently held beliefs. There is no problem with saying, for example, that someone lost in the woods has most reason to take route X, even though this is not something which they have a rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs.

### Fully Rational

Some theories allow the creation/destruction of underived desires. Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one's interests at the expense of others) are irrational.

This is because some theories are "fully rational", not merely fully informed, where "fully rational" extends beyond correct ends-means deliberation. This is necessary to handle irrational desires. Otherwise, it would not be able to account for degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on one's hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would be against coming into contact with germs because of an intrinsic disgust reaction, and they would think, all things else considered, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires.

Now, imagine that if a person were presented with Black crime or IQ statistics. Now, whenver they encountered a Black person, they have a natural, underived fear reaction and they are always thinking about the IQ that the person has. And when they do come across a low IQ Black person, they didn't notice the low IQ before, but now uncontrollably think of IQ when they see Blacks and so they make a note of his low IQ. This feeds into a cycle of implicit bias preventing them from feeling comfortable around minorities. They might try to suppress the reactions as best they could but they can't help themselves. The fact that full information would produce certain responses in people doesn't make those responses rational.

### Explained by Constructivism

Constructivism may be able to explain ideal observer theories of rationality. A constructivist would agree that an agent's idealized motivations provides the agent with reasons, but only insofar as the agent actually valued the motivations of such an idealized agent. Because the agent's reasons depend crucially on his own desires, it is constructivist. Presumably, some such desires are actually necessary for rational agents, i.e. because rational agents deliberation they necessarily care about what they would value post-deliberation, because rational agents seek truth, they necessarily care about what they would do when fully informed. Perhaps additional considerations can be said about unification, psychological compulsions, etc.

Thus, there is a sense in which certain elements of an agent's motivational set take priority over other elements. E.g. a person's desires about what one would desire post-deliberation outweighs their current desire, a person's desire to not desire a hard drug outweighs his desire for the drug. The "oughtweigh" and "priority" here is in terms of normative priority, not intensity or what will actualize. The question is then how to explain the hierarchical nature of motivational elements. One explanation might be given by looking at the desires that the agent takes to constitute his *identity*. People identify more with higher-order desires, desires that they would have post-deliberation, etc. Perhaps the ubiquity of reflection and deilberation requires this. How should identity be characterized and why does this determine the priority of one's reasons?

### Problems 

#### Substantive Problems

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms and not make too many substantive assumptions about what this consists in. Otherwise, it doesn't really inform us of what to do. That said, some problems with the proposals so far, and existence internalism in general, are that they don't seem to be able to account for the following actions that it seems we have reason to follow, independent of what is in our motivational set: 

* Preparing oneself to satisfy future ends. This may be accounted for by adding a "fully experienced" constraint to the idealization process.
* Criticizing the satisfaction of a past desire after experience. Note that this cannot be accounted for by the full information constraint, because one's future self, A+, can criticize one's past self, A, for desiring X even if A would mantained that desire under full information (i.e. even if A mantained the desire to X despite knowing that A+ disapproved of A desiring X). This may be accounted for by adding a "fully experienced" constraint.
* Preferring unified desires. This may be accounted for if the given conception of full rationality allows for the creation and destruction of new underived desires, which Williams and Smith think it does.
* Preferring intrinsic desires that are more likely to be satisfied. 

#### Structual Problems

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do. What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis.
- They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.

## Quasi-truth-apt

If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.
