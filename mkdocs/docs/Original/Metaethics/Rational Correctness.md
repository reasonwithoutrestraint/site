# Rational Correctness

Forms of truth:

## Alternative conceptions of truth

There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:

- Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal judgments:
- Probabilistic judgments:
- Causal judgments:
- Counterfactual judgments:

## Existence Internalism

According to existence internalism with regard to reasons: A has normative reason to X iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational. Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational/informed deliberation. Normative reasons are the output of correct deliberation from one's motivational reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is a sound deliberative route from an agent's motivational reasons to C.

Everyone agrees that "sound deliberative route" requires that the deliberation not be based on false beliefs, but some give more substantive accounts as what counts as correct deliberation. Michael Smith, for example, appears eerily externalists in that he believes that he believes there are some non-self-defeating desires (e.g. considering only one's personal desires at the expense of everyone else's) that would not be held by fully rational creatures.

A plausible internalist cannot propose that one has reason to do X if and only if one would desire X under full information.

### Constructivism

See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street, (Bernard Williams?)

The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself. 

A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of *cannot* is not rational, but what is *constituitive* of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.

### Ideal Observer

See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith, Firth, (Bernard Williams?)

An agent A has a reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. The idealization requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end deliberation. 

- The agent holds no false beliefs and all relavent true beliefs.
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).
- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Uusing imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
- Being free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Systematically unified desires.

Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one's interests at the expense of others) are irrational.

*Observer-based not agent-based.* Note that the rationality of X does not reduce to whether A+ desires X. The rationality of X rather reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X. This is because doing otherwise could not cannot account for rationality under uncertainty. Consider the case when it is rational to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though there can be circumstances where doing so is rational. E.g. imagine someone finds themselves in the woods and they want to get out as soon as possible. The rational thing to do might be to do seek a person and ask for directions, find a map, etc. but this would not be desired by a being that already had full information.

*Fully rational not full information.* Also note that this is not purely a full information account. One also needs to be fully rational. The reason is because this is necessary to handle irrational desires. Otherwise, it would not be able to account for degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on one's hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would become against coming into contact with germs because they would just fine them disgusting, and they would think, all things else considering, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires.

Now, imagine that if a person were presented with Black crime or IQ statistics. Now, whenver they encounter a Black person, they have a natural, underived fear reaction and they are always thinking about the IQ that the person has. And when they do come across a low IQ Black person, they didn't notice the low IQ before, but now uncontrollably think of IQ when they see Blacks and so they make a note of his low IQ. This feeds into a cycle of implicit bias preventing them from feeling comfortable around minorities. They might try to suppress the reactions as best they could but they can't help themselves. The fact that full rationality would produce certain responses in people doesn't make those responses rational.

#### Problems 

#### Structual Problems

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do. What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis.
- They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.

#### Substantive Problems

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms and not make too many substantive assumptions about what this consists in. Otherwise, it doesn't really inform us of what to do. That said, some problems with the proposals so far, and existence internalism in general, are that they don't seem to be able to account for the following actions that it seems we have reason to follow, independent of what is in our motivational set: 

* Preparing oneself to satisfy future ends.
* Criticizing the satisfaction of a past desire after experience. Note that this cannot be accounted for by the full information constraint, because one's future self, A+, can criticize one's past self, A, for desiring X even if A would mantained that desire under full information (i.e. even if A mantained the desire to X despite knowing that A+ disapproved of A desiring X).  
* Preferring unified desires. This may be accounted for if the given conception of full rationality allows for the creation and destruction of new underived desires, which Williams and Smith think it does.
* Preferring intrinsic desires that are more likely to be satisfied. 

## Quasi-truth-apt

If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.
