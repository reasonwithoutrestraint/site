## Problems 

### Semantic

Incompatible:

1. Moral judgments are truth-apt.
2. Truth-apt judgments must be beliefs (i.e. descriptive).
3. Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.
4. Beliefs are not sufficient for intrinsic motivation.

Rejections:

1. Rejected by non-cognitivists.
2. Rejected by cognitivist non-descriptivists (non-cognitivst with minimal truth theories, pragmatists, constructivists).
3. Rejected by morality-motivation externalists.
4. Rejected by non-Humean theories of motivation.

### Metaphysical

Incompatible:

1. Moral duties provide agents with reason for action.
2. Moral duties apply to all agents (some infer an independence of any agent's desires). 
3. Practical reasons are necessarily dependent on desires.
4. There are no necessary desires in all rational agents
5. There are moral truths.

Rejections (among truth-apt positions): 

1. Rejected by morality-reasons externalists.
2. Rejected by subjectivists.
3. Rejected by non-Humean theories of rationality.
4. Rejected by metaphysical egoists.
5. Rejected by error-theorists.

## Overview

### Plattitudes

Normative Thinking:

- Some behaviors are independent of thought (involuntary actions)
- Some behaviors are motivated by thoughts, call these motivational thoughts (undeliberate voluntary actions).
- Some motivational thoughts are reformed via deliberation, call this deliberation normative reasoning (deliberate voluntary actions).  

Essential Normative Plattitudes: 

- Ubiquity - All rational creatures invoke normative judgments.
- Motivation - To invoke a normative judgment favoring X is to express a motivational tendency to X. To the extent that somehow fails to do what they judge to have most reason to do, they are acting irrationally.
- Reasoning - Normative judgments can be modified/improved via reasoning and argumentation.
- Disagreement - People genuinely disagree about normative judgments.
- Supervenience 

Controversial Normative Platitudes:

- Truth-aptness
- Descriptive
- Objective
- Non-reductive

Moral Plattitudes

- Moral facts necessarily apply to all rational agents.
- Moral facts provide reason for action.
- Moral facts supervene on the descriptive facts.
- Moral facts differ from practical reasons generally (i.e. they call for blame, shame).

## Key Divides

The Road to Moral Realism

The latter one rejects on the road, the more problems they face accommodating external (non-moral) requirements.

The earlier one rejects, the more problems they face accommodating internal (moral) pretensions

Multidisciplinary issues that cause external accommodation issues as one goes toward realism 

### Semantic & Phenomenological: Cognitivism & Descriptivism

Are normative statements truth-apt? 

Do normative judgments express beliefs? I.e. do they describe entities, properties or relations?

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are neither truth-apt nor descriptive
    - Components:
        - Semantic: Robust conception of truth (usually)
        - Normative judgments are not truth-apt
        - Normative judgments are not expressive of beliefs (they do not describe any normative facts, entities, properties or relations).
    - Varieties: 
        - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
        - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
        - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
    - Cons:
        - Semantic: Embedding problem
        - Phenomenology: Moral attitude problem
        - Violates pretension of normative discourse
2. Non-descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt, but not descriptive
    - Components:
        - A minimalist conception of what is necessary for truth-aptness.
        - A sentence is truth-apt if they are conditions when it can be asserted.
        - There are conditions when it can be asserted based on the grammatical rules of the language.
        - Normative judgments are not expressive of beliefs (they do not describe any normative facts, entities, properties or relations).
    - Varieties:
        - *Assertoric Nondescriptivism*: Minimalist theory of truth. A staatement is truth-apt merely if there are standards where the statement can be asserted appropriately or not, e.g. a grammatical structure, accurate expression of the speaker's attitudes, etc. 
        - *Pragmatism*: TBD
        - *Constructivism*: Coherence theory of truth. Normative truth is constructed by our normative judgments. Thus, normative judgments can be true or false with reference to other normative judgments. Normative judgments express a world-to-mind fit attitude - but an attitude of *valuing* rather than *desiring*. Valuing something has constituitive features other than mere *desiring*.
    - Pros:
        - Other non-descriptive truth-apt linguistic domains: modality, probability, causation.
    - Con:
        - Semantic: Problem of creeping minimalism
        - Phenomenology: moral attitude problem
        - Violates pretension of normative discourse
3. Descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt and describe moral entities, relations or properties.
    - Components:
        - Semantic: Robust conception of truth
        - Normative judgments are expressive of beliefs tracking normative facts, and can be truth-apt insofar as they accurately represent the normative facts.
    - Cons:
        - Flexibility of language: A ought to X, A needs to X, A must X, X is crappy, X is disgusting, etc. can all mean the same thing. Best explained as prescriptions and/or expressions, rather than reports/descriptions.
		- Normative Education/expressions: we teach children to form certain moral judgments by molding their non-cognitive attitudes; and this is done by rewarding/punishing behavior with various non-cognitive attitudes, and by showing examples of appropriate attitudes in certain circumstances.
		- Motivational content: many descriptive theories fail to meet the motivational constraint.
    - Variations: 
        - *Irreducible*: When one says "X is M", this cannot be understood in nonnormative terms.
            - *non-naturalism*: the referrent of the predicate M is not a natural property. Normative propositions are synthetic a priori. 
            - *naturalism*: the referrent of the preidcate M is a natural, but normative, property.
        - *Analytic reductionism (naturalism)*: When one says "X is M", the moral predicate M means the same as some natural predicate N, knowable a priori.
        - *Synthetic reductionism (naturalism)*: When one says "X is M", the referrent of the predicate M is identical to some natural property N. Variants:
            - *a priori*: the referrent of the predicate M is knowable a priori.
            - *a posteriori*: the referrent of the predicate M is knowable a posteriori.
        

### Metaphysics: Objectivism vs Subjectivism

The metaphysical relation between normative truth and normative judgments. Are the truth-condition of normative judgments attitude-independent?

1. Constructivism: 
    - Components:
        - There are no normative facts. 
        - Normative truth is a construction of our normative judgments. 
        - Normative propositions can only be true contextualized to a given set of normative propositions.
        - Analogy: legal truth is a construction of legislature.
    - Variations:
        - Humean constructivism: there are no constituitive necessary propositions that must feature in one's set of normative judgments.
        - Kantian constructivism: there are some constiuitive necessary propositions.
    - Cons:
        - There may not be constituitive features of certain classes normative judgments. 
2. Subjectivism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are identical to some actual or hypothetical judgments.
    - Vareities:
        - Subjectivism: Normative facts are grounded in the normative judgments of some actual or hypothetical agent(s).
        - Dispositionalism: Normative facts are gounded in the relevant attiudes of some actual or hypothetical agent(s).
    - Cons:
        - Semantic: Open-Question Argument (against reductivism)
        - Cannot account for disagreement.
        - Normative: Cannot explain categorical normative authority (if used to analyze morality directly).
        - Normative: Cannot analyze normativity generally (if analysis depends fully informed judgments, cannot explain epistemic normativity).
3. Objectivism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are ontologically prior to, and can explain, normative judgments.
    - Cons: 
        - Motivation: Cannot explain intrinsic motivation
        - Normative: Cannot ground intrinsic rationality
        - Arguments often apply to judgments that are clearly objective.

Fourth option that no one accepts: normative facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Error-Theory vs Success-Theory

1. Error-Theory
    - Pros:
        - See cons for objectivism & naturalism/non-naturalism
    - Cons:
        - Arguments often apply to normativity generally, which cannot work.
2. Success Theory

### Metaphysics: Naturalism vs Non-naturalism:

Some ways to draw the naturalism - non-naturalism divide:
- Reductive: naturalistic theories reduce the normative to the non-normative (not necessarily true)
- Metaphysical: naturalistic facts have spatio-temporal properties, causal effects, etc.
- Epistemological: natural facts must be discovered a posteriori.

1. Naturalism:
    - Cons against analytic reductivism:
        - Semantic: Open-Question argument
        - Semantic: Twin-Earth
        - Semantic: Translation
    - Cons against synthetic reductivism:
        - Semantic: Moral Twin-Earth
        - Epistemology: Cannot explain a priori normative knowledge
        - Epistemology: No trivial, objective entities to fix the reference of moral terms (unlike, e.g. 'water' or 'yellow'). 
    - Cons against non-reductivism:
        - How it differs from non-naturalism?
2. Non-naturalism: 
    - Cons:
        - Supervenience: supervenience is unexplained as a conceptual necessity
        - Supervenience: how we learn supervening relations a priori, i.e. maybe natural property X co-instantiates normative property Y in one circumstances but not the other.  
        - Ontology: Causal redundancy => ontological bloat
        - Ontology: Causal redundancy => evolutionarily useless
        - Epistemology: Causal redundancy => lack of epistemic access

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

Ways of addressing the normative status of morality, and the motivational status of normativity.

Normativity:

1. Normative judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Normative judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Normative judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

Moral Rationalism:

1. Moral facts must provide *necessary* practical reasons (apply to all rational agents necessarily).  
2. Moral facts must provide *necessarily overriding* practical reasons.

Moral Motivation:

1. Moral judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Moral judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Moral judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

## Positions

These positions are categorized with regard to their stance regarding general normativity, i.e. normative reasons or rationality generally, rather than moral normativity specifically. Thus, even though Railton's account of morality is realists (as the moral facts are independent of any agent's personal attitude), his position is classified as "attitude dependent descriptivism" as his account of rationality is subjective to the desires of an ideal observer.

### Non-cognitivism

Normative statements are not truth-apt.

#### Classical

##### A.J Ayer - Expressivism

##### C.L. Stevenson - Emotivism

##### R.M. Hare - Universal Prescriptivism

##### Objection - Frege-Geach Problem

#### Modern

##### Simon Blackburn - _Essays in Quasi-realism_

##### Allan Gibbard - Plan-Expressivism - _Thinking How to Live_

#### Objections

### Non-descriptivism

Normative statements are truth-apt, but do not aim at describing or reporting normative facts, i.e. normative entities, properties or relations.

See "Creeping Minimalism" and "Four faces of moral realism" for more on non-descriptivism.

The truth-conditions are attitude-dependent. Very similar to simple subjectivism, except it denies that normative judgments are descriptive. They lies somewhere between reports and mere expression (as with non-cognitivism).

#### Mark Timmons - Assertoric Nondescriptivism - _Morality without Foundations_

#### Hilary Putnam - Pragmatism - _Ethics without Ontology_

#### Sharon Street - Constructivism - Various Essays

#### Korsgaard - Kantian Constructivism - _Sources of Normativity_

#### John Rawls - "Kantian Constructivism"

#### Objections

### Attitude Dependent Descriptivism

Normative statements are truth-apt and aim at describing normative facts. The normative facts are grounded in our current or hypothetical normative judgments. Value is the result of our conferring value to them, rather than us conferring value to them because they are valuable.

#### Gilbert Harman - Relativism

#### Roderick Firth - Non-reductive - _Ideal Observer Theory_

#### Michael Smith - Non-reductive - Idealized Observer - _The Moral Problem_

#### Peter Railton - Synthetic Reductive - Idealized Observer - _Moral Realism_

#### Objections

### Error Theory

Normative statements are truth-apt and aim at describing normative facts. But such facts do not exist. 

#### J.L. Mackie - _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_

#### Richard Joyce - _The Myth of Morality_

#### Objections

### REALISM

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. The moral facts are ontologically independent of our actual or hypothetical moral judgments. Further, moral facts can explain our moral judgments.
