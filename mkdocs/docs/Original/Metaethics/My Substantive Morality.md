# Substantive morality

- Constructivism
	- Reasons are contingent, subjective constructions.
	- Moral discussions committed to reasons for all.
	- Moral discussions committed to methodological objectivity.
	- Moral obligations exist only for those contingently engaged in moral discussions.
	- Moral truth = socially constructed.
- Moral principles
	- Regulating societal approval/disapproval
- Legal principles
	- Regulating coercion
	- More disagreement -> more libertarian principles. Why?

- Goodness/Badness
	- Reason for an individual to promote/desire
	- Individual Instantaneous Goodness
	- Lifetime Goodness
	- Collective Goodness
- Rightness/Wrongness
	- Reason for a society to approve/praise/disapprove/resent
	- Wrongness requires something bad for someone
	- Large increases justify small deficits

### Types of moral arguments

To argue that a particular act X is wrong/right in a particular circumstance C, there are a few possible arguments:

- Appeal to some fundamental principle that provides a determinate answer to the rightness/wrongness of X in circumstance C. See below for arguments in favor of fundamental principles. Of course, this is assuming that the fundamental moral principles form determinate answers, which need not be the case. This also assumes that there are fundamental moral principles, which need not be the case.
- Appeal to the obvious rightness/wrongness of an analogous act X' in an analogous circumstance C'. This theory can remain agnostic to the truth/weight of any fundamental moral principles (if any such principles even exist). This strategy is committed only to the fact that there clearly is a constraint on which *considerations* are morally relevant (regardless of whether and how those considerations can be reduced to certain principles). Considerations such as happiness, desires, autonomy, responsibility, etc. are potentially relevant moral considerations (i.e. humans clearly use these considerations in ordinary moral thinking; whether they really should be used and/or whether some of these are only instrumentally valuable is a further question). But there are clearly considerations that don't count as morally relevant. This style of argument works if it can be shown that the differences between C and C' are definitely not potentially relevant moral considerations.

To argue for certain fundamental principles:

- Reflective Equilibrium: Argue that these principles best explain, or cohere with, our considered moral judgments. The problem here is that the best principles that explain our moral judgments might not be nonconflicting, i.e. the considerations that explain our considered moral judgments might not reduce to the same principles (which means it might not provide determinate answers in all circumstances), and/or different people might have fundamentally different irreconcilable considered moral judgments.
- Foundational: Build these principles from the ground up, either from a metaethical theory, or pure rationality, or pure consistency, or from minimal constraints on any coherent moral theory. This may be too ambitious.

## The Good

### Individual Instantaneous Goodness

Only one constraint that I'm convinced of for now: in order for something to be good or bad for someone, that person has to be alive. Possibilties for individual goodness:

- Narrow hedonism (sensory pleasure): states of consciousness marked by some distinctive feature
- Preference hedonism (attitudinal pleasure): preferred states of consciousness
- Unrestricted preference satisfaction: satisfaction of whatever preferences
- Success theory: satisfaction of preferences about one's own life, i.e. preferences about features that are introspectively discernable
- Objective list theory: knowledge, friendship, etc.
- Other constraints: S taking attitudinal pleasure in state of affairs P, only when S deserves that pleasure and P deserves to happen.

### Individual Lifetime Goodness

Faces similar problems as collective goodness. See below:

### Collective Goodness:

- *Summation*
- *Average*
- *Pareto optimality*
- Principles that would be preferred by everyone if they didn't know where they would fall within the distribution.
- Small diminishes to someone with high well-being for a large increase to someone with low well-being.

## The Right - Fundamental moral principles 

### Against utilitarianism
 
Three components of utilitarianism:
1. Measure of individual good: for utilitarianism, this is happiness
2. Measure of collective good: maximizing total individual well-being of all agents equally.
3. Consequentialism: the right reduces to the good in some way. 

Problems:
1. How is happiness defined? (don't have huge opposition) 
	- Pleasure receptors. This is bad.
	- States of enjoyment. Better 
	- Conscious states that are preferred. Better
	- Preferences/desires. Doesn't seem like happiness
2. What aggregation function for collective well-being?
	- Maximizing the sum of utility. Bad, because increasing people is always better. So it can be good to torture someone to increase marginal utility in X number of people, so long as X is large enough.  
	- Maximizing the average. Bad, because having children with below average utility makes the world a worse place.
	- It seems clear that world X is better than world Y, where every individual in world X has higher utility than in world Y (or they would have higher utility if placed in world Y). But if this is not true for _every_ individual, then I'm not sure.
	- Utility Monster: The gap in sentience between pigs and humans entails that it would be better for an innocent pig to die to save a human. But it doesn't seem that a comparable gap between a human and a superintelligent alien entails that its better for an innocent human to die to save the alien. Certainly, it doesn't seem like we would be morally justified in killing the human to save the alien. And especially the human wouldn't be morally obligated to kill himself. What if the alien mistakenly put himself in a position whereby either he or a human had to die?  
3. Why assume that the right reduces to the good?
	- The good is all we care about. Sure, but that says nothing about morality. Plenty of normative realms are not just matters of promoting the good (epistemology, ettiquette, etc.), so why assume that's the case for morality? E.g. epistemology is not consequentialist.
	- Metaethical: morality just is social rationality, and rationality is promoting the good. Is that what morality is?
	- Intuition: if we could prove that subjecting someone to a course of action maximized their good (even if good is defined in terms of preference satisfaction), is it right to force someone to do this for their own sake? Just because doing something promotes good doesn't mean that performing that action is good (particularly if it uses force). This scenario is possible in the following scenario: (1) person has ideal (more informed, higher order, more rational, etc.) preferences that would be satisfied by doing X, but (2) he doesn't willingly do X, and this must be because of less ideal preferences. It would be wrong to force this person to do X if (3) he also has preferences that he not be forced to do X in situations where (1) and (2) are true; but it would be okay to use force if he preferred to be forced to do X in these situations. Of course, (3) says nothing about whether performing X really is good (maybe it is, maybe it isn't); the fact is we can't use force.

My necessary conditions for an action to be morally wrong:

- It must be bad for someone. This is agnostic with respect to one's theory of goodness.
- It must be the right kind of badness. The following sources of badness don't count:
    - Someone arbitrarily opposed to an action, i.e. people disgusted with homosexuality

Separability of persons:
- It seems a person can never be morally required to accept a principle that causes a severe harm to compensate for some comparable benefit for another person or group of persons.
- Maybe that only applies when 

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:

- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
	    - There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
	    - Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)

## Political Philosophy

### Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:

- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.

### Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

- Joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 
- Equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources.
	- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.
- Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.
- Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.
- Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 
	- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.
- Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

### My Theory

#### Equal Share Libertarianism

Note: might wanna change "values/interests" to "material opportunity". Since (1) cases of compensation are not focused per se on increasing the welfare of the agents, but on compensating for their lost negative liberty; and (2) people are free to form more substantive communal laws not because this necessarily increases their welfare, but because not allowing them to do that (and forcing them to live in a libertarian society) deprives them of some negative liberty.

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property) as indicated above. Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

I'm not sure what these "special circumstances" consist in, but one trivial example where such force can be exerted is this: when A is intoxicated or when is uninformed. Perhaps the circumstance is this: whenever A's values/interests commits himself to be controlled by others in a certain situation. The reason this allows for force is because people can be wrong about their values/interests and therefore force (rather than, say, reason) may be the only way to promote their values/interests.

#### Equal Share + Communal Property

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 

Note that "local community" means "more local than the global community", so a country counts as a "local community".

1. Rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required in a local community when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others *actually attempt to*, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. 
	- Examples of those forced to compensate
		- Monopolies that own all the resources. Individual companies physically hogging resources.
		- Economic societies as a whole that materially value only certain traits, e.g. certain cognitive ability (under capitalism), certain race (under racist capatilistic society), etc.; people without these characteristics cannot have a decent life. People who benefit from a system must compensate those who were harmed by the system.
	- Examples of compensation
		- Redistribution
		- Safety nets: disability, unemployment
		- Anti-discrimination laws
2. Some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). 
	- Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which:
		- (a) the extent to which there is agreement in values within the community
		- (b) people are free to exit the community, 
		- (c) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and 
		- (d) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the lives of those in the community.
		- (e) it is infeasible achieve the same effect by enforcing laws on a smaller scale.
	- These are optional, democratic choices from local communities for a way of life. These are almost always justified by enacting minor confiscation of the property of others (i.e. taxation, regulation, etc.) in order to prevent significant, material harms to others (i.e. assault, sickness, death, un-education,  etc.). 
		- Police
		- Firefighting 
		- Education
		- Food/drug regulation
		- Certain anti-discrimination laws (if the harm is material disadvantage, not psychological pain of seeing racism).
		- Healthcare
	- This is necessary to justify the state, which is a non-consensual use of force against fully informed, fully rational agents that is not based on rectification/compensation. Other libertarian arguments cannot do this.
		- *Right to avoid risk*. People have a right to avoid risky situations. Anyone who refrains from supporting a state commits a rights violations as this would make life risky for everyone else. Therefore, a state is justified to prevent rights violations against those who refuse to support it. This is a bad argument because we don't have a right to avoid risky circumstances. We have a right to avoid threats that are direct and immediate and so we can coerce anyone who makes such threats. But we have rights against risk.
		- *Right to law.* People have a right to have their right to liberty, life, etc. codified in a body of law. But why though?
		- *Samariton rights*. People have a right to violate others' right to property when doing so is needed to escape dire circumstances. E.g. someone lost in a snow blizzard has a right to break into someone else's cabin to save themselves. This may be valid, but it invokes positive rights which is not in the spirit of libertarianism. This, however, may be prferrable because it can justify, e.g., a police force even when the majority of people do not consent to it under a democratic system.

#### Disagreement

Broader laws are mandatory, non-negotiable. Local laws are decided democratically. Note also that the broader laws tend to be more libertarian whereas the local laws have the potential to be more authoritarian. In principle, the broader laws could be more authoritarian in different countries where there is homogenous culture where everyone agrees to some authoritarian rules. 

Perhaps, the ideal laws for a given region are simply the upshot of norms of the culture of that region. For homogenous societies, they are free to enforce whatever rules they prefer. However, when a region has a large diversity of opinion, then the range of acceptable laws narrows. The ideal laws for a region are the laws that it would be rational for that region to accept. However, if the views of a region are so diverse, then the only laws that it would be rational for a region to accept would be minimal libertarian laws that emphasized freedom and liberty. Laws regulating international affairs are the extreme of this: the only international laws there are are basic respect for the sovereignty of nations, protection from genocide, etc.

Coercive laws for members of group G are justified if and only if such laws would be approved of by fully informed and fully rational members of group G assuming they sought coercive laws to regulate behavior. A law is appropriate for group G only if it is the upshot of ideal social construction. When there is broad disagreement, the only laws that overlap with everyone's fully rational interest would be minimal libertarian laws.

Must explain the relationship between disagreement and ideal socially constructed norms in a way that explains:
1. That widespread disagreement implies that minarchism.
2. That minimal, but existent, disagreement does not imply minarchism.

#### Layers of force

Remember the types of force that can be justified
- Consent: Explicit/Implicit Consent
- Impairment: Lack of rationality/informed
- Rectification: Retaliation/Compensation against physical coercion and/or excess resource usage
- Democracy: Optional democratic communal laws 

Here are the types of force that can be justified in reality as it actually is.

Global
- Basically anarchism.
- Respect for the sovereignty of other countries.
- Retaliation against those that violate the sovereignty.
Diverse community (e.g. U.S.). All above plus
- Minarchism
- Military
- Courts for federal laws
- Police to enforce federal laws
- Food/drug regulation
- Compensation for monopolies
	- Redistribution
- Compensation for societal disadvantage
	- Safety nets: low cognitive functioning, disability, unemployment
	- Anti-discrimination laws
Homogeneous community (e.g. US city or European countries). Any of these could be valued (could even be minarchist). All above plus
- Courts for local laws
- Police to enforce local laws
- Firefighters
- Education
- Healthcare

Left-Leaning:

- Abortion
    - No restrictions
- Criminal justice
    - Rehabilitation and safety
    - Decriminalize drugs, don't legalize
	- Not retribution. Consider the cases:
		- Agent is morally evil but no longer a threat.
			- Has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed (not rehabilitated). He experiences no suffering. Should we still inflict harm?
		- Agent is a threat but not morally good. 
			- He should be rehabilitated, expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed. Doesn't matter whether this is due to moral corruption or uncontrollable circumstances.
		- Agent is neither morally bad or a threat.
			- Has been rehabilitated.
		- We can agree that if an agent has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed, then we shouldn't inflict suffering. Why is this not also true if he's been rehabilitated.
- Gay marriage
    - Government shouldn't be involved in marriage.
    - If they are, then it should not discriminate based on sex.
- Subsidized Education
    - Only awarded to those likely to repay them (based on e.g. test scores, grades, etc.)
    - Only have to be paid off after acquiring a certain income level
- Subsidized Healthcare
    - Maybe, if its effective.

Right-Leaning:

- Free Speech
	- Hate Speech allowed
	- Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Nazi Germany)
- School Choice
- Discrimination
    - Not inherently wrong
    - Wrong if its arbitrary and exclusionary (rather than balancing)
    - Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Racist USA)
- Affirmative Action
    - Ineffective insofar as it admits students of low standards
    - Don't care otherwise
- Welfare 
    - Provide a means of living for the poor. 
    - Maybe enough for a limited number of children. 
    - Don't incentivize unlimited reproduction for the unfit
- Immigration
    - We have the right to any restrictions
    - We should filter in-demand immigrants that can't be filled by natives
    - I desire low influx of immigrants

Other:

- Gun Control
	- Don't care
- Education 
    - Make impractical subjects optional
    - Less encouragement for college
    - Add practical skills
    - Add values.
