# Substantive morality

### Types of moral arguments

To argue that a particular act X is wrong/right in a particular circumstance C, there are a few possible arguments:

- Appeal to some fundamental principle that provides a determinate answer to the rightness/wrongness of X in circumstance C. See below for arguments in favor of fundamental principles. Of course, this is assuming that the fundamental moral principles form determinate answers, which need not be the case. This also assumes that there are fundamental moral principles, which need not be the case.
- Appeal to the obvious rightness/wrongness of an analogous act X' in an analogous circumstance C'. This theory can remain agnostic to the truth/weight of any fundamental moral principles (if any such principles even exist). This strategy is committed only to the fact that there clearly is a constraint on which *considerations* are morally relevant (regardless of whether and how those considerations can be reduced to certain principles). Considerations such as happiness, desires, autonomy, responsibility, etc. are potentially relevant moral considerations (i.e. humans clearly use these considerations in ordinary moral thinking; whether they really should be used and/or whether some of these are only instrumentally valuable is a further question). But there are clearly considerations that don't count as morally relevant. This style of argument works if it can be shown that the differences between C and C' are definitely not potentially relevant moral considerations.

To argue for certain fundamental principles:

- Reflective Equilibrium: Argue that these principles best explain, or cohere with, our considered moral judgments. The problem here is that the best principles that explain our moral judgments might not be nonconflicting, i.e. the considerations that explain our considered moral judgments might not reduce to the same principles (which means it might not provide determinate answers in all circumstances), and/or different people might have fundamentally different irreconcilable considered moral judgments.
- Foundational: Build these principles from the ground up, either from a metaethical theory, or pure rationality, or pure consistency, or from minimal constraints on any coherent moral theory. This may be too ambitious.

## The Good

### Individual Instantaneous Goodness

Only one constraint that I'm convinced of for now: in order for something to be good or bad for someone, that person has to be alive. Possibilties for individual goodness:

- Narrow hedonism (sensory pleasure): states of consciousness marked by some distinctive feature
- Preference hedonism (attitudinal pleasure): preferred states of consciousness
- Unrestricted preference satisfaction: satisfaction of whatever preferences
- Success theory: satisfaction of preferences about one's own life, i.e. preferences about features that are introspectively discernable
- Objective list theory: knowledge, friendship, etc.
- Other constraints: S taking attitudinal pleasure in state of affairs P, only when S deserves that pleasure and P deserves to happen.

### Individual Lifetime Goodness

Faces similar problems as collective goodness. See below:

### Collective Goodness:

- Summation over everyone's individual goodness.
- Average over everyone's individual goodness.
- No reducible metrics; only pareto optimal solutions.
- Distributions that would be preferred by everyone if they didn't know where they would fall within the distribution.
- Small diminishes to someone with high well-being for a large increase to someone with low well-being.

## The Right - Fundamental moral principles 

Necessary conditions for an action to be morally wrong:

- It must be bad for someone. This is agnostic with respect to one's theory of goodness.
- It must be the right kind of badness. The following sources of badness don't count:
    - Someone arbitrarily opposed to an action

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:

- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
	    - There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
	    - Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)

## Political Philosophy

### Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:

- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.

### Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	
- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	
- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 

equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources. 
	
- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	
- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.

Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	
- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.

Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	
- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	
- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.

Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 

- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.

Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	
- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	
- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

### My Theory

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property) as indicated above. Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

I'm not sure what these "special circumstances" consist in, but one trivial example where such force can be exerted is this: when A is intoxicated or when is uninformed. Perhaps the circumstance is this: whenever A's values/interests commits himself to be controlled by others in a certain situation. The reason this allows for force is because people can be wrong about their values/interests and therefore force (rather than, say, reason) may be the only way to promote their values/interests.

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 

1. rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others actually attempt to, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. It is necessary but not sufficient that others be unable to use/appropriate an equal share. It must also be shown that such individuals actually attempted to get such a share. If they never tried to use/appropriate such a share to begin with, then they are owed nothing, since their interests/values were never limited in promotion of someone else's.
2. some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which: (a) people are free to exit the community, (b) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and (c) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the lives of others. Note that this communal property probably isn't justified on any self-ownership principle; rather, it's justified because such property may be necessary for promotion of certain peoples' values/interests. In fact, there are levels to the extent that property is communal vs. private:
	- The larger the scope of a region that's communally owned, the more communal it is and the less private it is. Communal properties that are mostly private (e.g. small neighborhoods) can enforce larger constraints on behavior than larger communal properties that are mostly communal (e.g. cities). The reason smaller communities are afforded by restrictions is because conditions (a), (b) and (c) are more likely to be met. Smaller, more restricting communities, may be required to pay into a federal fund that that acts to sustain areas of the land where only libertarian laws are enforced, so that (a) and (b) are truly satisfied. Insofar as one cannot escape such a community (or if all available property is used up), compensation is obligatory for individuals (in the form of safety net, welfare, redistribution, etc.). 
	- Rather than thinking of (a) private property and (b) communal property in this binary fashion, it may be more useful to think of all property on a scale that goes from private to communal. The more private the property is, the stronger the full ownership rights will be. The more communal the property is, the weaker the rights will be. Note that nothing is fully private, not even a person's body (since I have shown that one's body may sometimes be controlled by others if it promotes the agent's values/interests). The extent to which property is private versus communal (i.e. the nature/strength of the ownership rights of that property) depends on the extent to which ownership of said property influences the values/interests of others. The more impactful ownership of certain property is to certain people (e.g. the only lake in the country), the more communal that property ought to be, among those people. The less impactful ownership of that property is to certain people (e.g. one of many empty plots of land in the city), the more property that property ought to be. Handling use of communal property should be done via a mechanism that best promotes the values/interests of the subjects involved, giving more weight to individuals influenced more by the property.
