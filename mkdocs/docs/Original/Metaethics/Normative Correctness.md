# Normative Correctness
`Questions`

1. What does it take for a statement or judgment to be truth-apt?
2. What are the standards of correctness for normative statements/judgments?

Forms of truth:

- General: Judgment S expresses state of mind M. S is _ if and only if M is _. 
- Descriptive Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal Judgments:
- Probabilistic Judgments:
- Causal Judgments:

Normative Judgments

- Epistemic Normativity: 
- Prudential Normativity: 
- Moral Normativity: 

Ways for accounting for normative truth in a non-descriptivist sense:

- Existence Internalism: 
    - Judgment Internalism: A judges that X is a normative reason iff X is a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Existence Internalism: X is a normative reason for A iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational.
    - Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational/informed deliberation.
	- Normative reasons are the output of correct deliberation from one's motivational reasons.
- Possible conceptions:
    - Constructivism/Constitutivism: 
        - The truth of a normative judgment is contextualized to the truth of other normative jugdments an agent makes.
    - Dispositionalism
        - Same truth conditions as constructivism, but now with the existence of descriptive normative entities. 
        - Normative reasons are naturalistic entities posited to explain our informed, rational attitudes (motivating reasons explain actual attitudes).
        - Analogy: naturalistic non-normative entities posited to explain our idealized perceptions.

The naturalists, constructivists no-descriptivists need not disagree here about the truth conditions. They all agree that the truth of a normative judgment consists in it being rationally derivable.

Quasi-truth-apt: Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.
