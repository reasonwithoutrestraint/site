# Normative Correctness

Forms of truth:

## Alternative conceptions of truth

There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:

- Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal judgments:
- Probabilistic judgments:
- Causal judgments:
- Counterfactual judgments: 

Normative Judgments

- Epistemic Normativity: 
- Prudential Normativity: 
- Moral Normativity: 

## Existence Internalism

According to existence internalism with regard to reasons: A has normative reason to X iff X would be a motivating reason for A insofar as A is rational. Thus, R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of informed rational/informed deliberation. Normative reasons are the output of correct deliberation from one's motivational reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is a sound deliberative route from an agent's motivational reasons to C.

Everyone agrees that "sound deliberative route" requires that the deliberation not be based on false beliefs, btu some give more substantive accounts as what counts as correct deliberation. Mich Smith, for example, appears eerily externalists in that he believes that he believes there are some non-self-defeating desires (e.g. considering only one's personal desires at the expense of everyone else's) that would not be held by fully rational creatures.

### Constructivism

See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street

The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself. 

A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of *cannot* is not rational, but what is *constituitive* of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.

### Ideal Observer

See: Peter Railton, Bernard Williams, Michael Smith, Firth

An agent A has a reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. The idealization requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end deliberation. 

- The agent holds no false beliefs and all relavent true beliefs.
- Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -> Y).
- Deciding which desires one places most weight.
- Uusing imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.
- Being free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.
- Systematically unified desires.

Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one's interests at the expense of others) are irrational.

### Problems 

The characterization of full rationality should not make reference to any normative terms and not make too many substantive assumptions about what this consists in. Otherwise, it doesn't really inform us of what to do. That said, some problems with the proposals so far, and existence internalism in general, are that they don't seem to be able to account for the following actions that it seems we have reason to follow, independent of what is in our motivational set: 

* Preparing oneself to satisfy future ends.
* Preferring intrinsic desires that are more likely to be satisfied. This may be accounted for if the given conception of full rationality allows for the creation and destruction of new underived desires, which Williams and Smith think it does.

## Quasi-truth-apt

If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld: 

- Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
- Certain normative judgments are better than others.
- The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.
