	- Explanatory
- Normative
    - Goals -> Reasons
    - Future Reasons -> Current Reasons
    - Others' Reasons -> Agent's Reasons
- Constructive

Some distinctions
- Non-obvious conceptual reductions - The concept "yellow" is the concept of having the surface reflectance properties to invoke the sensation of yellow in normal human observers.
- Non-conceptual property reductions - The property "yellow" *is* the property of reflecting light of wavelength XYZ.
- Necessary property coextension versus property reduction - some argue that the only way that property P is necessarily coextensive with property Q is if they are the same property.
- Perceiving/feeling X and judging X - Perceiving X to be yellow (having a certain sensation) =/= Believing X to be yellow (believing that normal humans are disposed to have the sensation).
- Holding attitude X and judging X to be reasonable.
