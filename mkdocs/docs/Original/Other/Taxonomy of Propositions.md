Relationship of Analytic, A Priori, Necessary:

- Analytic,
    - A Priori
        - Necessary
            - *Definitional*: "A triangle has three sides".
- Synthetic, A Priori
    - A Priori
        - Necessary
            - *Logical*: "A triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees".
        - Contingent
            - *Contingent Rigid Designator*: "The meter stick is one meter"
    - A Posteriori
        - Necessary
            - *Rigid Designator*: "Water is H2O".
        - Contingent
            - *Descriptive*: "Donald Trump is the president".


Rigid Designators: "Water is H2O", "Colors are certain surface reflactance properties", "Temperature is the speed of molecules", etc. Perhaps moral terms are like this too if we take a *causal reference* theory of properties.

Contingent Rigid Designators: We create terms (e.g. "one meter") which both (1) rigidly designate a direct reference (e.g. the length one meter), and (2) designate the references that they do because of something contingent (e.g. the length of the meter stick at the time we created the term).
