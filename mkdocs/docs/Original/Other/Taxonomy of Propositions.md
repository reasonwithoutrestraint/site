Relationship of Analytic, A Priori, Necessary:
- Analytic, A Priori, Necessary
    - *Definitional*: "A triangle has three sides".
- Analytic, A Priori, Contingent:
    - Impossible
- Analytic, A Posteriori, Necessary
    - Impossible
- Analytic, A Posteriori, Contingent
    - Impossible
- Synthetic, A Priori, Necessary
    - *Logical*: "A triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees".
- Synthetic, A Priori, Contingent
    - *Contingent Rigid Designator*: "The meter stick is one meter"
    - We create terms (e.g. "one meter") which both (1) rigidly designate a direct reference (e.g. the length one meter), and (2) designate the references that they do because of something contingent (e.g. the length of the meter stick at the time we created the term). 
- Synthetic, A Posteriori, Necessary
    - *Rigid Designator*: "Water is H2O".
- Synthetic, A Posteriori, Contingent
    - *Empirical*: "Donald Trump is the president".
