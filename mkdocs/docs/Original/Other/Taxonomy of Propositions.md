Relationship of Analytic, A Priori, Necessary:

- A Priori
    - Necessary
		- Tautological:
			- *Tautological*: "A triangle is a triangle".
		- Analytic
            - *Definitional*: "A triangle is a 3-sided polygon".
		- Synthetic
			- *Logical*: "A triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees".
	- Contingent
		- Analytic		 
			- *Contingent Rigid Designator*: "The meter stick is one meter"
		- Synthetic
			- *Subjective*: "Jane is thinking of X" (this will be a priori for Jane; a posteriori for others)

- A Posteriori
	- Synthetic 
		- Necessary
			- *Rigid Designator*: "Water is H2O".
		- Contingent
			- *Descriptive*: "Donald Trump is the president".

Rigid Designators: "Water is H2O", "Colors are certain surface reflactance properties", "Temperature is the speed of molecules", etc. Perhaps moral terms are like this too if we take a *causal reference* theory of properties.

Contingent Rigid Designators: We create terms (e.g. "one meter") which both (1) rigidly designate a direct reference (e.g. the length one meter), and (2) designate the references that they do because of something contingent (e.g. the length of the meter stick at the time we created the term). 

Some distinctions

Ontological
- Non-obvious conceptual reductions - The concept "yellow" is the concept of having the surface reflectance properties to invoke the sensation of yellow in normal human observers.
- Non-conceptual property reductions - The property "yellow" *is* the property of reflecting light of wavelength XYZ.
- Necessary property coextension versus property reduction - some argue that the only way that property P is necessarily coextensive with property Q is if they are the same property.

Psychology
- Perceiving/feeling X and judging X - Perceiving X to be yellow (having a certain sensation) =/= Believing X to be yellow (believing that normal humans are disposed to have the sensation).
- Holding attitude X and judging X to be reasonable. 
- Explicit versus Implicit committments, e.g. what can be inferred from the *assertion* of a proposition rather than the *content* of the proposition.

Epistemology
- Capacity of reason not the same as logic or perception (see Axioms.md)
