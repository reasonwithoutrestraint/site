## Sample

### Argument

1. Something cannot have come from nothing
2. Therefore, the universe came from something
3. Therefore, the universe must have come from God.

### Rebuttal

(1) would be an unsupported assumption. There's nothing *logically* impossible about something coming from nothing, i.e. there is no logical contradiction. So, presumably, you mean that it's *physically* impossible for something to come from nothing, i.e. our universe just so happens to abide by certain physical laws that prevent this from happening. But why assume that *this* is true? You might point to the fact that we have never *observed* something coming from nothing. The problem with this is that our observations of the universe are limited both *temporally* and *spatially*. This means we don't know if the *observed patterns* of the universe are actually *omnipresent laws* of the universe. The patterns that we notice in the temporally and spatially observable portion of the universe need not be laws that apply at *all* times and in places of the universe.

But let's assume that something cannot come from nothing. That would mean something had to exist eternally. However, it still doesn't follow that the universe must have formed from an external being. You say that the universe cannot itself be eternal because of (a) thermodynamics and (b) causality. According to you, (a) and (b) impose certain laws that prevent the universe from being eternal. These would presumably be *physical* laws and not *logical* laws (otherwise, I could also say it's logically impossible for this "external being" to be eternal). Your evidence for this is presumably *observation*. But, again, our observations are limited temporally and spatially, so the patterns we notice in the observable portions of the universe need not actually be omnipresent laws.

A final problem with your position is there doesn't seem to be a coherent distinction between the "universe" and this external thing. The universe, by definition, is everything that exists. If this external being ever existed, then it was, by definition, a part of the universe and not external. So, if we keep this "external" component of your argument, then your argument is this: the universe must have been caused by something that didn't exist. That would be incoherent, so that's probably not what you mean. But if we drop the "external" component of your argument, then your argument becomes this: the universe must have been caused by a being that does not follow the current patterns of the observable universe (e.g. something cannot come from nothing, laws of entropy, laws of thermodynamics, etc.). In that case, your argument *would* be coherent and probably correct: the physical laws governing the origins of our universe must have differed from the patterns that we observe now. Thus, there's no reason to keep the "external" component, as that would make your position not only unsupported, but also incoherent. 

## General structure

### Argument

1. The universe cannot not have a creator because of reasons R (e.g. something cannot come from nothing, cannot be infinite because of causality, thermodynamics, etc.)
2. Reasons R don't apply to God
3. Therefore, God must have created the universe

### Rebuttals

1. These reasons are claimed to be logically necesary laws. In that case, they refute God.
2. These reasons are claimed to be logically contingent laws of our universe (i.e. physical laws, albeit universal and omnipresent). What evidence do we have of this? We only have observation of patterns, which are limited temporally and spatially. There's no reason to believe these are actually omnipresent laws, i.e. applying at all times and all places.
3. Let's say that there are omnipresent, universal physical laws of our universe. Regardless, why assume that the laws that apply *internal* to our universe govern the *creation* of the universe.
4. Let's say that there are omnipresent, universal physical laws that govern the creation of the universe. Why assume that the leads to God. This only suggests that there needs to exist an external entity capable of creating a universe like ours. None of this suggest the features commonly attributed to God, i.e. omnipresence, omnipotence, consciousness, thinking, omnibenevolence, etc. And it certainly doesn't suggest the features commonly attributed to God by the Abrahamic religions, i.e. that he has intervened in human affairs, that he has a plan for humans.
