I"¥#<p>This concerns <em>reductive</em> naturalism the view that contains the following components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Normative concepts refer to normative properties (against non-cognitivism / constructivism).</li>
  <li>Some normative propositions are true (against Error Theory).</li>
  <li>Normative properties can be reduced to entities which are the subject matter of physics (synthetic naturalism).</li>
  <li>Normative properties can be reduced to non-normative properties (reductive synthetic naturalism) (optional).</li>
  <li>Normative concepts can be reduced to non-normative concepts (reductive analytic naturalism) (optional).</li>
</ol>

<p>Forms of non-reductive naturalism, which deny both 4 and 5 (e.g. David Brink and Nicholas Sturgeon), are edge cases not considered here.</p>

<p>Also, analytic non-reductive naturalism (e.g. Michael Smith) is not considered here.</p>

<p>It is not clear what the difference is between non-reductive naturalism (analytic and Synthetic) and metaphysically naturalist forms of non-naturalism. Perhaps one difference is that naturalistic theories appeal to explanation. Nor is it clear what the difference is bewteen Realism with non-ontologically committed conceptions of truth and constructivism/non-cognitivism. The difference seems to amount to difference in a conceptual scheme (e.g. like the differences between saying a statue is identical with its constituent marble versus being seperate). The difference must lie in the attitudinal nature of the judgments. Is motivation necessarily entailed or not?</p>

<h2 id="analytic-naturalism">Analytic Naturalism</h2>

<p>Note: some of the arguments here seem similar to the arguments shown in Descriptivism.md. The reason these arguments are also here is because they donâ€™t defeat descriptivism broadly. Because, these arguments, by not mentioning the importance of attitudes, donâ€™t generally defeat cognitive theories that ignore attitudes.</p>

<p><em>Open Question Argument</em>. (1) Any proposed analytic reduction of a term must be uninformative and obvious. (2) Any analytic reduction of goodness would be informative and nonobvious. (3) Therefore, there can be no analytic reduction of moral terms. Consider the question â€œIs X goodâ€. Now, imagine that a proposed complex analysis of goodness states that all questions of the form â€˜Is X goodâ€™ are questions of the form â€˜Does X have naturalistic property Yâ€™. The problem with this is that, we can always further ask â€œIs it good that X has property Yâ€. This further question is clearly intelligible and coherent. But, if goodness that could be analyzed in terms of Y, then such a question would not be intelligible.</p>

<p><em>Descriptive beliefs donâ€™t entail normative judgments</em>. If M and N are <em>definitionally</em> identical, then if A <em>believes</em> that X has property M, then it logically follows that A also <em>believes</em> X has property N (and vice-versa). Note that this is stronger than mere <em>property</em> identity, e.g. H2O might be identical to water, but the fact that A believes water is H2O does not logically entail that A believes it is water (or vice-versa). However, this logical relation does not hold between and normative property and any natural property. If we know that A believes that X has natural property N and he later says that â€œX has moral property Mâ€, then we have always learned something new about A.</p>

<p><em>Insistence on Normative Language</em>. If normative term N really meant natural term M, then why not carry on making claims about M? If the thesis were true, this would be equivalent to making claims about N, so there should be no difference. The fact that one chooses not to do so implies either (1) he believes that there really is something about N not captured in M, or (2) he believes that society believes that there is something about N not captured in M. Either way, either he or society believes that N and M are not analytically equivalent.</p>

<p>Response: deny that all analytic reductions must be trivial and uninformative. Counter: Explain why the normative instance of the paradox of analysis differs from other cases. Normative judgments are supposed to provide reasons for action. In other cases, we would be fine to abandon the terms being analyzed (i.e. no problem switching from â€œknowledgeâ€ to â€œjustified true beliefâ€). But this is not true in the normative case.</p>

<p><em>Normativity reduced to Tautology</em>. While it may be appropriate for an analytic reduction to be nontrivial, it is not appropriate that an analytic reduction could ever provide one with a <em>reason</em> for action. If normative concept M can be analytically reduced to natural concept N, then saying â€œN is Mâ€ would be a tautology, and thus could provide no reason for action. For example, if goodness could be analytically reduced to pleasure, then if someone said â€œpleasure is goodâ€, then this would be equivalent to saying â€œpleasure is pleasureâ€ or â€œgoodness is goodnessâ€. But presumably the claim â€œpleasure is goodâ€ is supposed to provide someone with reason for action. But no tautology such as â€œpleasure is pleasureâ€ or â€œgoodness is goodnessâ€ could ever provide a reason or motive for someone to promote pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Ethical disagreements reduced to disputed semantics or descriptions.</em> If analytic naturalism is true, then two parties disagree ethically only if they disagree descriptively. But people can disagree ethically without disagreeing descriptively. There can be two people who represent reality identically without having similar ethical attitudes with regard to that representation. This can only be explained by positing that the two parties have different semantics, but then this wouldnâ€™t even be a genuine disagreement. This means that two societies with ethical terms that had different semantic meaning (but were identical in that those terms guided the respective societyâ€™s behavior) would not really disagree with each other. They would be talking passed one another.</p>

<h2 id="reductive-synthetic-naturalism">Reductive Synthetic Naturalism</h2>

<p><em>A Priori Argument</em>. It seems we can come to learn about normative truths a priori. This is inexplicable if there is an a posteriori synthetic relationship between normative facts and non-normative facts. I.e. we cannot learn a priori that yellow is such and such wavelength, or that water is H2O. Yet how can it be the case that we can learn a priori that, e.g. some natural property <em>necessarily</em> co-instantiates a normative property?</p>

<p><em>Lack of Disagreement</em>. Synthetic identities can be found in other domains because we can easily fix the referrents of terms like â€œwaterâ€ or â€œyellowâ€, and then we can find that property that is always instantiated with that referrent. One strategy for doing this is to present a dispositional analysis: an entity is â€œyellowâ€ just in case it causes sensation that we normally perceive as â€œyellowâ€. Such a dispositional analysis is not promising for moral terms. Imagine that two societies are lingustically identical except when one society used the word â€œgoodâ€ they referred to pleasure and the other society referred to Godâ€™s will. On this reading, the two cultures wouldnâ€™t even disagree with each other, since the content of â€œgoodâ€ in these two societies are different - they are using the same word to track different phenomenon. But it seems that these cultures can coherently disagree with each other, especailly if they each act in accordance with what is good.</p>

<h3 id="cornell-realism">Cornell Realism</h3>

<p>These take a <em>causal reference theory</em> for moral properties, because a causal reference theory is the standard theory of reference for natural kind terms. This rejects the <em>description theory of reference</em>. What determines whether a natural property is good is not whether it has the attributes ascribed to it by the term â€œgoodâ€, but whether it causally regulates our use of the word â€œgoodâ€. We are looking not at the semantic attribution behind the term, but rather at the properties causally responsible for that word.</p>

<p>This is similar to how we use the word â€œhealthâ€. When we say that someone is â€œhealthyâ€, itâ€™s unclear what the <em>meaning</em> of that might be. â€œHealthinessâ€ is a complex natural property that is not directly observable. Thus, â€œhealthinessâ€ cannot be <em>equated</em> with any simpler set of properties that are directly observable. However, we can determine what property â€œhealthyâ€ <em>refers to</em> by finding what causally regulates our use of the term â€œhealthâ€. This can be done by looking at the simpler set of properties that <em>are</em> directly observable; these would be <em>indicators</em> of â€œhealthinessâ€ rather than <em>equivalent</em>. â€œHealthinessâ€ thus has a robust causal profile, which means the property of being healthy can figure into causal explanations of our observations. Much the same is true of moral properties.</p>
