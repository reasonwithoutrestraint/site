I"”!<p>This concerns <em>metaphysical</em> non-naturalism which has the following components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Normative concepts refer to normative properties (against non-cognitivism / constructivism).</li>
  <li>Some normative propositions are true (against Error Theory).</li>
  <li>Normative concepts cannot be reduced to non-normative concepts (against analytic naturalism).</li>
  <li>Normative properties cannot be reduced to non-normative properties (against reductive synthetic naturalism).</li>
  <li>Normative properties cannot be explained by the entities studied by physics (against non-reductive synthetic naturalism).</li>
</ol>

<p>Forms of metaphysically naturalistic ethical non-naturalism, which deny 5 (e.g. Landau, Scanlon, etc.), are edge cases not considered here.</p>

<p>It is not clear what the difference is between non-reductive naturalism (analytic and Synthetic) and metaphysically naturalist forms of non-naturalism. Perhaps one difference is that naturalistic theories appeal to explanation. Nor is it clear what the difference is bewteen Realism with non-ontologically committed conceptions of truth and constructivism/non-cognitivism. The difference seems to amount to difference in a conceptual scheme (e.g. like the differences between saying a statue is identical with its constituent marble versus being seperate). The difference must lie in the attitudinal nature of the judgments. Is motivation necessarily entailed or not?</p>

<p>These objections must not prove too much. Some or all of the above features are also true of counterfactual, probabilistic and causal properties, and many other a priori realms of knowledge (e.g. philosophy in general, mathematics, etc.). For each of these types of properties, either an explanation must be given as to how they can exist but not non-natural moral properties, or an explanation must be given as to why such properties do not really exist.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Counterfactual statements: do not really exist. They are constructs we use to aid in considering other possibilities. They are features we apply to propositions that are consistent with some proposition of the current set of known propositions.</li>
  <li>Causal statements: causation cannot perceived. Moreover, causation is not even something that means anything. If there are two realities with all the same events that take place, except where one there is casuation and one where there is complete randomness, then the worlds are identical. Causation doesnâ€™t exist. Causation is merely a useful heuristic tool that we attribute to events to plan for future scenarios.</li>
  <li>Probabilistic statements: there are no genuine stochastic processes, not because our reality doesnâ€™t have them, but because it wouldnâ€™t mean anything for them to be true. Again, these are useful linguistic tools.</li>
  <li>Predictive statements:</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above class of statements can be given a constructivist/anti-realist analysis.</p>

<p>Noteably, Hume found that the following cannot be derived from statements about the way the world is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statements about the way the world will be.</li>
  <li>Statements about the way the world ought to be.</li>
  <li>Statements about what caused what.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="causal-inertness">Causal Inertness</h2>

<p>The lack of influence that normative properties place on the world pose the following three problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Concept</strong>: <em>There is no evolutionary benefit to developing a capacity to track these properties</em>. In order for there to be a benefit in developing a perceptual faculty, that faculty must be useful at increasing an organismâ€™s biological fitness. The only perceptual faculties useful in increasing an organismâ€™s biological fitness are faculties that track relevant natural facts, as natural facts are the only facts that influence an organismâ€™s chance at reproducing.</li>
  <li><strong>Epistemology</strong>: <em>We have no epistemic access to non-natural facts</em>. It is a necessary condition on justified belief that oneâ€™s belief be explained by the facts in question. Perceptions of natural facts are good evidence for natural properties not because of an intrinsic connection between <em>perceiving</em> p and p being true. Rather, <em>perceiving</em> p is good evidence for p only if p <em>being true</em> causally exlpains why one perceives p. The reliable causal connection between <em>p being true</em> and <em>perceiving p</em> is required to treat <em>perceiving p</em> as a relibable detection of p. There is no way that a non-natural fact p could ever causally explain how we perceive or judge p to be true. Thus, we cannot treat our judging that non-natural fact p as evidence that p is true. This means none of our normative beliefs are ever justified.</li>
  <li><strong>Ontology</strong>: <em>Parsimony is preferrable to complexity with regard to ontology</em>. When determining which entities exist in the world, we should use inference to the best explanation. Theories with fewer assumptions and better explanatory power are superior. Imagine a world without any non-natural properties but with all the same natural properties. These two worlds would have equal explanatory power, but the world without unneeded properties would have less assumptions and would therefore be superior. The reason is because non-natural properties must be causally inert. The existing of non-natural properties is not necessary to explain reality as we see it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="moral-supervenience">Moral Supervenience</h2>

<p>It seems to be an a priori conceptual truth that moral properties supervene on the non-moral properties, i.e. two circumstances which have identical non-moral properties must also have identical moral properties. This can be easily explained by naturalism, but it is difficult to see how this is explained by non-naturalism. There are two issues here, one epistemological and one ontological.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Epistemology</strong>: When we see an action that we judge to be wrong, we donâ€™t just judge it to be wrong in that particular circumstance. We judge that a particular action with certain natural properties always coinstantiates normative properties. Non-naturalism purports that we perceive the non-natural moral facts as we perceive certain natural facts. But there is nothing about this perceptual model that <em>necessarily guarantees</em> that we will perceive the same moral facts in circumstances where we perceive the same natural facts. Any perceived supervenience would be, at best, a posteriori; the supervenience relation couldnâ€™t be perceived, for have only perceived the one circumstance Thus, the perceptual model of non-naturalism cannot explain the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral.</li>
  <li><strong>Ontology</strong>: It is a <em>conceptual</em> truth that the normative supervenes on the non-normative. No two worlds can have the same non-normative properties yet have different normative properties. Thus, normative properties and non-normative properties are not just coextensive, they are <em>necessarily</em> coexstensive; they are coexstensive in all possible worlds. However, there are no distinct properties that are coextensive in all possible worlds. If two properties are distinct, then there must be <em>some</em> possible worlds where only one of the properties obtain. Thus, normative properties, <em>if they are properties</em>, must be natural.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Non-naturalism fails to account for the motivational feature of normative judgments for the very same reasons that mind-independent naturalism fails. The fact that moral properties move from the natural realm to the non-natural realm does not increase the motivational weight. Attributions of goodness to P appear to have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any non-naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are necessarily action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only contingently action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.</p>

<p>How to know when our perceptions go astray? How to know if weâ€™re suffering from an optical illusions? How to know whatâ€™s the best state of mind to be in when evaluating the reliability of intuitions?</p>
