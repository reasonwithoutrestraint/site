I"èD<p>Existence internalism characterizes rationality without explicitly requiring any particular motivations. Note that this does not reduce internalism to an Actual Motivational view whereby an agent needs to be actually motivated to perform the action. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of <em>ideal</em> deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of <em>sound, valid, fully imaginative</em> (from Williams) deliberation. Other forms of internalism might require being in a sound state of mind, having full experience, etc. In other words, normative reasons are the rational extension of oneâ€™s motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is some rational procedure from an agentâ€™s motivational reasons to C (without presupposing any new motivational states along the way).</p>

  <li>Constructivism and Expressivism:
    <ul>
      <li>Some say that constructivism is best understood as a form â€˜expressivism,â€™ which holds that normative terms function to guide action rather than represent matters of fact and are used to express states of mind that differ from belief (Chrisman 2010; Lenman 2012; Lenman &amp; Shemmer 2012b; Meyers 2012). Furthermore, Lenman argues that embracing expressivism would promise to solve a basic problem for constructivism, specifically, the problem of identifying the kinds of mental state that normative judgments are (Lenman 2012). This suggestion is not shared. Humean constructivist Street has forcefully argued that expressivism fails to fully explain the normative function of normative discourse, which cannot be reduced to expressing normative states (Korsgaard 2003, 2008: 312, 325 n. 49, 2009: 309; Bagnoli 2002: 130â€“132; Magri 2002; Street 2010: 239â€“242).</li>

<p>??? question â€œSome questions left unansweredâ€
	- Conception of rationality that doesnâ€™t beg the question against externalism.
	- How constructivism and expressivism can be reconciled. Two kinds of judgments. Constructivists claim that the truth of a normative claim is consituted by the normative judgments of the given agent. The normative judgments of the given agent are analyzed under expressivism. How are we to analyze the normative claim which constructivists state can be true? 
	- How to distinguish well-being (what makes a life go best) from reasons for action/desires? 
		- Some differences:
			1. X might provide high well-being without an agent having reason to X, e.g. experience machine, animals, etc.
			2. It is sensible to ask whether an agent has reason to do something that promotes their well-being due to some other end.
		- Reasons for action/desire = considerations in favor of an action, whether the agent knows it or not.
		- Well-being = how an agent assesses their own life to be going from their first-personal perspective, possibly under idealized conditions.
	- I understand the argument that there is no normative truth independent of normative judgments (i.e. the metaphysical/epistemological/motivational problems with realism).. But how do we establish that normative truth for a given agentâ€™s depends on <em>that</em> agentâ€™s normative judgments? E.g. why not the normative judgments of the agentâ€™s community? Or the normative judgments of the speaker? Why not understood â€œreasonsâ€ broadly as a standard by which to criticize someone, e.g. because people are subject to criticism for being cruel, and because reasons are standards of criticism, why not say cruel people are unreasonable? There are infinitely many possible theories of normative truth that donâ€™t reduce normative truth for A to Aâ€™s normative judgments, without also having the metaphysical/epistemological problems of realism. 
		- We can understand â€œshouldâ€ claims as general standards to ground criticism, e.g. people â€œshouldâ€ not act immorally, even though they may have no reason not to do so.
		- â€œReasonsâ€ may be sometimes used in this broad sense, but for clarity this concept will be identified with the narrow sense (connected with an agentâ€™s normative judgments) leaving â€œshouldâ€ the job of handling general grounds for criticism. 
		- A motivational argument can be given perhaps. 
		- Kosgaardâ€™s states that such an account is the only thing that can explain the normative authority of deliberation for agents. What does this mean?
		- Why focus on reasons in the internal sense? Similar considerations can be used to explain why reasons for belief are internal rather than external (i.e. rather than simply beliefs that are true).
		- The internal sense is what we use not just for charges of criticism but for charges of irrationality.
		- The internal sense is the kind of reason we acknowledge when we judge that something is a reason from a first-person perspective rather thana third-person perspective.
	- What is the general strategy for determining what is constitutive of a given activity?</p>

<p>Conceptual constraints on reasons agreed to by internalists and externalists:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everyone agrees: Aâ€™s judgment that he has reason to X will motivate A to X insofar as he is rational</li>
  <li>Controverial: if proposition C is a reason for A to X, then Aâ€™s awareness of C will motivate A to X insofar as he is rational and fully informed.
    <ul>
      <li>This is true only if the fact that (1) C is a reason for A to X, (2) Aâ€™s full rationality and full descriptive information, and (3) Aâ€™s awareness of C entails that he will judge that C is a reason to X. Is this true? If this is true, then it will entail motivation to C.</li>
      <li>This seems true only if a fully rational/informed awareness of C (assuming C is a reason to X) will necessarily entail a judgment that C is a reason to X. This judgment is required for the above because the judgment is sufficient to produce motivation, and there doesnâ€™t seem to be any other connection between something being a reason and it motivating an agent (otherwise, why would a consdieration motivate an agent if the agent did not recognize the consideration AS a reason).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Externalists account for this:
    <ul>
      <li>Externalists have to posit that rationality has substantive requirements, i.e. a desire to do what is kind, generous, etc. or whatever they posit people have reason to do.</li>
      <li>Or externalists have to posit that rational agents have an <em>additional desire</em> to do what they judge themselves to do.</li>
      <li>The question is still what is the <em>content</em> of the judgment that something is a reason, and how can this motivate anyone to do anything?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>But the question isnâ€™t even about the <em>content</em> of reasons judgments. For a non-cognitivist, there is no content. For constructivists, truth is not based on the contents (i.e. one has reason to X only if they judge that they have reason to X, but clearly the judgment that one has reason to X cannot just reduce to this). But if the <em>content</em> of reasons judgment does not determine what counts as a reason, then what does? What is the job description of a theory of reasons. When one says A has reason to X iff p (e.g. p = internalism, some form of externalism, etc.), what are the requirements on p?</li>
  <li>Perhaps, the requirement is this: if it is true that A has reason to X iff P, then Aâ€™s recognition of P must entail a judgment that they have reason to P. This will satisfy constructivism and internalism. The only way that recognition of P could entail a judgment that A has reason to X (which is itself a motivation; normative judgments are motivating) is if P was intimately tied to Aâ€™s motiation to begin with (the internalism thesis). Likewise, under constructivism, P just is the fact that A judges that they have reason to X (or that it follows from their normative judgments that they have reason to X). Anyone who recognizes this must neessarily recognize that they have reason to X.</li>
  <li>But why accept this job description? This job description may be true for conceptual analysis where you say reasons judgments MEAN a certain thing (even then, such a job description would be controversial), but asserting necessary/sufficient conditions is not conceptual analysis. So why accept this? E.g. X is yellow iff X reflects light of a certain wavelength, but this does not imply anyone who judges X has a certain wavelength has to judge that it has a certain color (or vice-versa). There are a few responses
    <ul>
      <li>Perhaps reasons are different because there are no actual reasons properties or relations, unlike color</li>
      <li>Perhaps we are actually doing conceptual analysis by positing this job description. But I thought non-cognitivism was the conceptual analysis and there is no content of reasons judgments.
        <ul>
          <li>Perhaps the analysis of normative claims can be different than base normative judgments. Of course normative claims often express our normative judgments, but perhaps they also do something else sometimes, i.e. express what we think follows from someoneâ€™s evaluative standpoint.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perhaps when positing this job description, we are just expressing attitudes as predicted by non-cognitivism</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What ARE we doing when we say that a certain job description is true? There seems to be a disinction between (1) ordinary judgments that one has reason to do something and (2) reasons judgments involved in asserting internalism, constructivism, job descriptions for a theory of truth, etc.? Are these the same kind of judgments? Are they both just expressions of a non-cognitive sentiment?</li>
  <li>Assuming non-cognitivism is true, why assume there is a theory of truth? Why assume there <em>are</em> reasons instead of just <em>judgments</em> about reasons? E.g. we agree that people judge things to be scary/funny. But that doesnâ€™t imply that some things actually ARE scary/funny in a sense above/beyond judging them to be scary/funny. Perhaps constructivism does not claim that the existence of <em>reasons</em> are anything above/beyond <em>judgments</em> about reasons. Perhaps, when one a constructivist says â€œyou have reason to Xâ€ this is just a convenient way of saying â€œyour normative judgments commit you to X, whether you know it or notâ€. Perhaps the job description for a theory of truth is to satisfy certain grammatical/linguistic requirements along with the following minimum requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>People can be wrong about what they have reason to do.</li>
      <li>We can improve toward â€œtruthâ€ when our judgments change</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A seperate theory of truth is needed</li>
  <li>What status are we giving to a consideration when we say â€œI might have a reason to do X, but I donâ€™t believe I doâ€. What are we doing during deliberation, as we seemingly â€œfigure outâ€ what to do?</li>
  <li>The answer is to look at the standards that we are committed to in our normative judgments: consistency, coherence, reflection, etc. Insofar as we deliberate, we are committed to the upshots of these standards. But we can be mistaken about the upshot of these standards. Thus, the truth of normative judgments is whatever the upshot of these standards are because we are aiming at these standards. Thus, normative truth is related to normative judgments not in an attributional sense (i.e. in the sense of looking at the properties that we ascribe to things when we make normative judgments) but in a regulative sense (i.e. by looking at the standards that are implicitly guiding our judgments). It is by looking at rules that are implicit in our deliberations. Thus, this is truth not in a correspondence sense. Deliberation is an activity the standards of which we construct and impose on ourselves.</li>
  <li>We might not even be aware of what the standards are. But they regulate our judgments nevertheless (i.e. those who are unaware of the rules of consistency).</li>
  <li>Why are these the standards?
    <ul>
      <li>They guide our thinking whether we know it or not.</li>
      <li>They cannot in full awareness be rejected. CANNOT here means conceptually not rationally. E.g. if someone in full awareness endorsed inconsistent judgments, then they wouldnâ€™t legitimately count as making a judgment in the first place. Theyâ€™re not irrational, but they are not even an agent, so terms like rationality/irrationality do not apply. They would be irrational if they accepted an inconsitency but was NOT aware of the inconsistency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Note that this DOES not imply that deliberation is an activity that attempts to figure out the upshots of deliberation while adhering to the implicit standards (which would be a kind of naturalism). We are not trying to answer theoretical questions to represent reality or counterfactuals. We are trying to answer practical questions, determining what to do. Rather, the implicit standards are regulating our deliberation (and thus determine success for the activity) independently of whether we are aware.</li>
  <li>Why this constructivism is compatible with non-cognitivism
    <ul>
      <li>Deliberation does not aim to answer theoretical questions. It does not aim to represent the way the world is. Against cognitivism</li>
      <li>The upshots of deliberation are inherently motivating insofar as one is rational. Note, however, that they differ from ordinary motivating states such as desires because of the standards that are constituitive of normative judgments - e.g. instrumental reasoning CANNOT in full awareness be denied if one is to count as a deliberating agent. CANNOT here means conceptually not rationally. I.e. it is not that one is being irrational by failing to follow instrumental rationality in full awareness; rather, they arenâ€™t attempting to deliberate rationally. Someone IS being irrational when they fail to follow instrumental rationality NOT in full awareness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Normative Truth consists in what follows from an agentâ€™s evaluative standpoint.
    <ul>
      <li>This is not what we <em>mean</em> when we form a normative judgment. When weâ€™re form a normative judgment, we are just settling the practical question of what to do, rather than the theoretical question of what the upshots of our commitments are. Abandon a semantic theory of truth (whereby the truth of a proposition occurs when the state of affairs <em>meant</em> by the proposition are obtained)</li>
      <li>Rather, this is a question that we are aimed to answer (whether we know it or not), when in the process of settling practical questions.</li>
      <li>Final question: why should normative truth be construed as relative to the evaluative standpoint of the agent in question rather than the speaker? The reasoning here has all taken a person characterization; i.e. we are considering the standpoint and perspective of the agent. But why not instead focus on the judge? This analysis might capture what agents are attempting to do when answering normative questions, but it need not be what judges are doing when they are answering normative questions for others. Two possibilities:
        <ol>
          <li>Posit that there is some special semantic/psychological difference between speakers endorsing actions for others, and endorsing actions for themselves. In the former case, truth is not relative to their (the speakerâ€™s) motivations; it is somehow relative to the subjectâ€™s motivations. I.e. the speaker commits themselves to judging what follows from the agentâ€™s evaluative standpoint whether they know it or not. In the latter case, the judge is only committed to judging what follows from their own evaluative standpoint. The former seems difficult to explain if the function of the judgments is merely to express plans/sentiments.
            <ul>
              <li>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that we expect that if the agent accepts our claim that they have reason to X, this will instill in them a motivation to X insofar as they are rational. But this only makes sense if X is connected to their evaluative standpoint.
  -&gt; But this doesnâ€™t necessarily work to show that truth is relative to the agent. Because if â€œaccept our claim that they have reason to Xâ€ just means â€œagree that they have reason to Xâ€ which just means adopting a motivation to X, then the speaker cannot expect that without believing that X is connected to their evaluattive standpoint. It would be equivalent to a speaker believing: if the agent becomes motivated to X, then they will be motivated to X insofar as they are rational. But clearly this doesnâ€™t require X be connected to their present evaluative standpoint.
  -&gt; Perhaps instead it should be: when we judge that Y (a proposition) <em>is</em> a reason to X (a behavior), then we expect that agents aware of Y will become motivated to X (because of their awareness of Y) insofar as they are rational [or perhaps, that agents aware of Y will judge that they have reason to X insofar as they are rational; or that a rational agentâ€™s awareness of Y could <em>explain</em> why they judge themselves to have reason to X]. So the constructivist/internalist conceptual component is only about judgments about what <em>constitute</em> reasons rather than all reasons judgments. Now we need an analysis of what fully rational means without begging the question. 
  -&gt; So we need to explain the conceptual connection between explanation/motivation and third-personal normative judgments, and how this can be reconciled with non-cognitivism which denies that there is any essential content to normative judgments.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Street, â€œWhat is Constructivism in Ethics and Metaethicsâ€, See section on Expressivism. She outlines three strategies for explaining semantics of moral terms (1) state that its impossible because normative attitudes cannot be reduced, (2) argue for an inferentialist semantics, whereby the truth of claim consists in what inferences one needs to make to be competent with the concept, (3) argue for a reforming definition, or (4) adopt the expressivist theory.</li>
  <li>Street, â€œConstructivism about Reasonsâ€, 237-241. Here, Street argues for (1) from above.</li>
  <li>See above section under â€œExpressivism and Constructivismâ€ for more
Strategies:</li>
  <li>Normative judgments can be explained by an expressivist theory, possibly the judgments cannot be reduced to non-normative judgments.</li>
  <li>Normative assertions and normative truth can be explained by either (1) an inferentialist theory as described above or (2) a pragmatic theory. (1) may be acceptable but (a) it needs to be fleshed out more and (b) why is it concerned with the agent rather than the speaker. (2) requires more investigation.</li>

<h2 id="existence-internalism">Existence Internalism</h2>

<p>Some twists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Externalism too broad, move to internalism.</li>
  <li>Actual motivations too narrow, require idealized conditions.</li>
  <li>Not all actual states provide reasons, move to constructivism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider analogy with theoretical reasons along the way.</p>

<p>Varieties of internalism:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual Motivation: A has reason to X only if A is motivated to X.</li>
  <li>Actual State: A has reason to X only if A has some motivational attitude that supports doing X.</li>
  <li>Counterfactual Motivation: A has reason to X only if A would be motivated to X under circumstances C.</li>
  <li>Counterfactual State: A has reason to X only if A would have some motivational attitude that supports doing X under circumstances C.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Motivation views, â€œis motivatedâ€ and â€œcan be motivatedâ€ donâ€™t just mean some motivation that may be overridden by other motivations. It means the source of an agentâ€™s volition that drives them to act intentionally. For State views, a Motivational attitude is a certain kind of psychological state which plays a role in motivation. These states are often taken to be desires, but can include other attitudes such as emotions, intentions, and aversions. Motivation views do not, by themselves, require the presence of any particular kind of psychological state which does the motivating, and State views do not, by themselves, require that the motivating state which is present actually does any motivating.</p>

<p>It is a platitude about reasons and rationality that: R is a normative reason for A to X iff R would be a motivating reason for A to X if A were rational and A was aware of R. In other words, reasons are the upshot of full rationality and full information. The question is how to characterize rationality. Internalism gives a <em>procedural</em> characterization of rationality. It usually specifies a form of ideal <em>deliberation</em>, i.e. of moving from certain motivations to action and other motivations. Externalism specifies an <em>substantive</em> characterization of rationality that specifies certain substantive elements like â€œa motivation to help othersâ€. i.e. being rational might require being converted rather than sound reasoning.</p>

<p>The above is a true platitude only if we use a fairly broad definition of rationality. But Scanlon narrows rationality to just doing that which you judge yourself to have reason to do. Which means to be irrational is to fail to adopt the attitudes that one judges themselves to have reason to adopt. This makes sense to me. I wouldnâ€™t call someone irrational if they failed to do what they would do if they reflected more or were more experienced. â€œRationalityâ€ as used above seems to simply mean â€œidealized personâ€.</p>

<p>Existence internalism characterizes rationality without explicitly requiring any particular motivations. Note that this does not reduce internalism to an Actual Motivational view whereby an agent needs to be actually motivated to perform the action. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of <em>ideal</em> deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of <em>sound, valid, fully imaginative</em> (from Williams) deliberation. Other forms of internalism might require being in a sound state of mind, having full experience, etc. In other words, normative reasons are the rational extension of oneâ€™s motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is some rational procedure from an agentâ€™s motivational reasons to C (without presupposing any new motivational states along the way).</p>

<h3 id="motivational-argument-1">Motivational Argument 1</h3>

<p>One argument for internal reasons states that reasons must be capable of motivating action.</p>

<p>The argument:</p>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A were fully rational.</li>
  <li>A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>The central question here is (2). (1) and (3) are both a priori, conceptual truths. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements, so may seem to be question-begging. We need to give an independent argument for (2), in a way that explains how to pick out which dispositions provide reasons.</p>

<p>Modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œFully Rationalâ€ may need to be explicitly characterized in terms of â€œideal sound deliberationâ€ or something more specific, so that (2) is not seen as question-begging against the (rare) externalist who says that full rationality might endorse behaviors for A that A has no dispositions to do.</li>
  <li>From Scanlon: One option is to characterize â€œrationalityâ€ just in terms of consistency. So that one is irrational only if they fail to adopt an attitude that they do not judge themselves to have reason to have.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Procedural rationality</strong></p>

<p>This is to support (2) of the explanatory argument: A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements. We need an independent argument for procedural rationality to support (2). And we also need to explain why itâ€™s not just any olâ€™ dispositions that are needed to supply an agent with reasons for action, i.e. an agent might have a disposition to overvalue short-term gains at the expense of long-term losses, but this <em>mere</em> disposition is not what grounds any reasons to value short-term gains as one might think from (2). Instead, what matters is what dispositions that agent actually endorses under deliberation. But now we seem to be making the deliberative argument below:</p>

<h3 id="motivational-argument-2">Motivational Argument 2</h3>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A deliberated soundly.</li>
  <li>A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation only if A is disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, (1) needs to be argued for, as it is no longer merely a plattitude. It almost may seem to be question-begging against the externalist. We might be able to accept (1) if we accepted constructivism. Normative truth derives from the normative judgments an agent makes, and it is constituitive of agency to value oneâ€™s motivations under deliberation. So we just need to argue for constructivism.</p>

<h3 id="rational-argument">Rational Argument</h3>

<p>Motivation is too strong. Recognition of p (where p is a reason to X) need not create motivation to X. This happens when only two things happen (1) A recognizes p as a reason and (2) A is motivated to act on his reasons. (2) is a seperate claim that makes the first premise unnecessarily strong, so lets remove it and focus on (1).</p>

<p>This also implies two forms of rational defect: (1) failure to recognize oneâ€™s reasons as reasons, and (2) failure to be motivated by what one recognizes to be a reason.</p>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if A could recognize R as a reason to X upon believing R.</li>
  <li>A could recognize R as a reason to X upon believing R only if R follows from Aâ€™s current normative judgments</li>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if R follows from Aâ€™s current normative judgments</li>
</ol>

<p>Defend (2): Beliefs have a mind-to-world fit. Normative judgments have a world-to-mind fit. Mind-to-world fits cannot influence world-to-mind fits. Thus, a belief alone cannot cause a normative judgment. But this doesnâ€™t show (2) is true. Perhaps R must follow from Aâ€™s current normative judgments + his other desires?</p>

<h3 id="explanatory-argument">Explanatory Argument</h3>

<p>Normative reasons are counterfactual explanatory reasons (Michael Smith w/out ideal observer).</p>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if R could explain why A would X under sound, ideal deliberation.</li>
  <li>That A is motivated to X by believing R can be explained only by something in Aâ€™s desires, goals, etc. favoring doing X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in Aâ€™s desires, goals, etc. that motivate a sound, deliberative A to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note we have (1) which is not a plattitude which one might object to. However an argument for (1) might be: (1) should be accepted by considering the cases where we perform actions because of normative reasons. The times where there is a disconnect between our motivating and normative reasons, we can point to some sort of problem, either we arenâ€™t aware of the reasons, we have false information, we suffer from addiction, etc.</p>

<p>Note that (1) is a weaker claim than in earlier arguments. To say that R could explain why A X-ed is weaker than saying R could motivate A to X. The former says that, if A were motivated to X (which might not be possible), this could be explained by R. The latter says that it is possible for A to be motivated to X (because of R).</p>

<p>The reason that reasons statements are not based on the hypothetical motivational sets of e.g. a fully moral A, i.e. A+, is because it is important that reasons statements apply directly to A. Note, however, that we can still focus on the somewhat idealized A who has deliberated, because we can infer that A already values the motivations of himself after he has deliberated. We can infer this from the fact that he is in fact deliberating. So he already values his deliberation.</p>

<p>But why should reasons statements for A be based on what he actually values in any present moment? This seems question-begging against the externalist. Two reasons (1) We make claims about reasons for the purpose of influencing, motivating, or guiding agents. But the only thing that can guide agents (assuming they donâ€™t suffer from addictions, false beliefs, etc.) are elements from their motivational set. And (2) this is a basic premise of constructivism (see below).</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-theoretical-reasons">Focus on Theoretical Reasons</h3>

<p>(not a different argument from above; perhaps an elaboration of the explanatory argument).</p>

<p>Points to be learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existence internalism may seem to be disproven by theoretical reasons because beliefs are justified by features other than oneâ€™s motivational set (i.e. oneâ€™s desires).</li>
  <li>However, the motivational set for beliefs wouldnâ€™t just be desires; it would be other beliefs, perceptions, judgments, intuitions, etc. And these DO justify beliefs.</li>
  <li>Not all elements from oneâ€™s motivational set are relevant. E.g. desires donâ€™t justify beliefs.</li>
  <li>Which elements are relevant?</li>
  <li>Why are those elements relevant?</li>
  <li>The relevant elements are the agentâ€™s normative judgments.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, there is a narrow and broad sense of normative judgments. The broad sense refers to general â€œshouldâ€ statements that could simply serve as standards by which we can criticize and evaluate the behavior of others - this includes internal and external reasons. There is also a narrow sense that refers to internal â€œreasonsâ€ statements. The question is why this distinction is important and what is special/important about internal reasons statements.</p>

<p>Consider reasons for belief. One could say that one has reason to believe just whatever is true. In a sense, this could be true. But it seems that there is another, independent role played by reasons statements about belief. Reasons in this more narrow sense are conferred to considerations that guide our deliberation as we decide what to believe. The fact that something is an external reason for belief - the fact that itâ€™s true, for example - cannot be a consideration that one takes to be reason to decide their belief. I.e. if you asked someone why they believed X and they responded with â€œbecause X is trueâ€, this would do nothing to explain their belief. We expect them to respond with an accessible feature of their motivational set - e.g. their other beliefs, their intuitions, their normative judgments, etc. Likewise, external reasons for action cannot be a consideration that someone takes to be a reason for action, unless we assume itâ€™s already connected with their motivational set. E.g. if you asked someone why they did X, and they responded with â€œbecause X is kindâ€ (yet they had no care for kindness), this wouldnâ€™t really explain why they did X.</p>

<h3 id="procedural-rationality">Procedural Rationality</h3>

<p>There are two types of reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Internal: What could be entailed from the appropriate elements of an agentâ€™s motivational set via some idealized procedure or set of conditions. The rational extension of oneâ€™s motivational set.</li>
  <li>External: general grounds for criticizing an agent, i.e. broad use of â€œshouldâ€. A general positive status that we confer to behaviors that we approve of.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why is the distinction important and what is special/important about internal reasons statements?</p>

<p>Consider the earlier discussion of theoretical reasons. That is, reasons for beliefs must be internal to an agentâ€™s perceptions, intuitions, etc. even though there is a sense in which it is appropriate to confer a positive status to certain beliefs on the basis of external reasons i.e. their truth. The reason is because, regardless of the appropriateness a attitude on externalist grounds, we <em>need</em> a system to confer status to attitudes on internalist grounds. There are times when we donâ€™t have access to considerations that warrant approval of certain attitudes. In those circumstances, we still need to make a choice. Thus, we need a procedure that determines which attitudes are worth adopting. And we need an element of language to play this role in explaining this status. Internal reasons statements play this role.</p>

<p>When we deliberate, we are trying to answer the question of which attitudes to adopt. During theoretical reasoning, we are determining what beliefs to adopt. During practical reasoning, we are determining what intentinos to adopt. Because theoretical reasoning involves determining whether a given proposition, say, P is true, the <em>mere fact that P is true</em> cannot possibly serve as a reason to believe P; at least not when â€œreasonâ€ is understood as the status we confer to beliefs during deliberation about what to believe. From the agentâ€™s perspective, s/he begins unsure as to whether or not P is true and is trying to answer that question. He thus cannot use <em>the fact that P is true</em> as a reason to believe P. Similar considerations apply to practical reasoning. Practical reasoning involves determining whether a given intention X is to be adopted. Therefore, the <em>mere fact that X is virtuous or kind or fair</em> cannot serve as a reason to do X. Again, the agent begins unsure as to whether virtue or kindness or fairness is a reason to intend to something. Thus, the mere fact that an action has these properties cannot be taken as a reason for an intention. In general when deliberating, the only considerations that we can appeal to as reasons for action are considerations that we already accept to be reasons for action. There is no normative truth outside of what we take to be normative.</p>

<p>The very activity of normative reasoning is to address conflicts in motivations. The problem to which normative thinking is designed to address is conflicts in our motivations. This means that normative thinking is not designed to track any mind-independent truth. Evenif it can be said that there is some mind-independent truth external to the world of the relevant kind, there is no way that this could relate to normative reasoning. Normative thinking is only answerable to our given motivations and normative judgments.</p>

<h3 id="constructivist-argument">Constructivist Argument</h3>

<p>Constructivism + Judgment Internalism = Existence Internalism</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constructivism: A has a reason to X only if Aâ€™s normative judgments in some sense endorse X-ing.</li>
  <li>Judgment Internalism: Aâ€™s normative judgments endorse X-ing only if A has some motivation to X.</li>
  <li>Existence Internalism: A has a reason to X only if A has some motivation to X.</li>
</ol>

<p>Constructivism is actually a narrow form of existence internalism if we accept judgment internalism and if we believe one can have motivating reasons without judging them to be normative reasons. In that case, the motivating reasons corresponding to oneâ€™s normative judgments would be a strict subset of their motivational set. Of course, there is still the question of why we should accept constructivism in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="constructivism">Constructivism</h2>

<p>Three categories of normative judgments</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constituitive: normative judgments held by all agents insofar as they are rational</li>
  <li>Internal: normative judgments held by a particular agent, i.e. narrow use of â€œreasonâ€. Or what is entailed from an agentâ€™s normative judgments.</li>
  <li>External: grounds for criticizing an agent, i.e. broad use of â€œshouldâ€</li>
</ol>

<p>The question is why does the internal/external divide matter and why do internal reasons count as real reasons?</p>

<p>The answer is this: There is a sense of reasons such that if an agent fails to do what <em>he judges</em> to be a reason R, then he is irrational. But this can be true only if the agent judges R to be an internal reason. I.e. if an agent fails to do what he <em>endorses</em> (i.e. an internal reason judgment), then he is irrational. But if he fails to do what he judges to be endorsed from some other perspective (which would be an external reason judgment), e.g. the moral perspective, then he is not being irrational. So reasons in the sense of being connected with rationality or irrationality must be internal. The property of <em>being a reason</em> is a status we confer give to considerations that we endorse upon deliberation.</p>

<p>The question now is why assume rationality cannot be broadened to include substantive normative judgments, so that someone who fails to respond to e.g. moral reasons are irrational beause rationality requires being moral?</p>

<p>Some Arguments</p>

<ol>
  <li>Little ontological baggage.</li>
  <li>Allows for a credible epistemology.</li>
  <li>Explains many constituitive properties of certain normative domains.</li>
  <li>Explains existence internalism (assuming we accept judgment internalism).</li>
  <li>Doesnâ€™t seem like reasons can be discarded as meaningless. One canâ€™t ask â€œwhy be rationalâ€.</li>
</ol>

<p>See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street, (Bernard Williams?)</p>

<p>The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of Aâ€™s other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself.</p>

<p>A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of <em>cannot</em> is not rational, but what is <em>constituitive</em> of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.</p>

<h3 id="disallowing-brute-error">Disallowing Brute Error</h3>

<p>See â€œConstructing Ortagorean Objectivity.mdâ€</p>

<h3 id="theory-of-error">Theory of Error</h3>

<p>The basic idea is that we have reason to adopt attitude X if adopting attitude can be entailed from our current set of judgments.
But how to account for agents who have false normative judgments?
After all, such judgments are a part of their judgments, so it can be said to be â€œentailedâ€ from their current set of judgments.</p>

<p>The answer is that some normative judgments are strictly of higher priority than others. 
There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Judgment A sets the context for when judgment B is relavent. E.g. the difference between endorsing what you would endorse if unemotional, fully reflective, etc. versus what one endorses in the heat of the moment. The former is an endorsement about the kinds of conditions that determine when oneâ€™s actual endorsements are valid.</li>
  <li>Judgment A is constituitive of the very activity. Thus, it cannot be discarded in favor of A. E.g. judging that one has reason to adopt the means to meet an end is constitutive of adopting the end.</li>
  <li>Judgment A is extremely difficult to get rid of. E.g. relying on induction, memories, perceptions, caring about our future selves, etc. In fact, insofar as someone were able to not rely on these features, they would have psychological states completely unlike anything of our own.</li>
</ol>

<p>Part of the practice of establishing normative attitudes is establishing attitudes that regulate other attitudes.
There is a hierarchy of normative judgments abound.
Other considerations for favoring one judgment over another:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is more likely to acccomplish
If there is no significant difference in any of the points mentioned above between two potential normative judgment, there is not necessarily a more â€œcorrectâ€ position to adopt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-conceptions-of-truth">Alternative conceptions of truth</h3>

<p>There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.</li>
  <li>Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.</li>
  <li>Modal judgments:</li>
  <li>Probabilistic judgments:</li>
  <li>Causal judgments:</li>
  <li>Counterfactual judgments:</li>
</ul>

<p>Rational Judgments</p>

<ul>
  <li>Epistemic Rationality:</li>
  <li>Prudential Rationality:</li>
  <li>Moral Rationality:</li>
</ul>

<p>Under constructivism, for normative judgments, truth is not based on some correspondence to some mind-independent normative reality. There is no standard of correctness for normative judgments independent of what we ourselves decide to be valuable. There is no sense in determining that someone has a reason to do something if it cannot be inferred from what they actually judge themselves to have reason to do.</p>

<p>If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.</li>
  <li>Certain normative judgments are better than others.</li>
  <li>The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="constituitive-features">Constituitive Features</h3>

<p>The central question is how to determine what requirements are constitutive of a type of behavior. One candidate is this: a requirement is constituitive of a behavior if no agent could consciously reject the requirement in full awareness.</p>

<p>Logical Consistency. One basic constituitive feature of normative judgments (and thuoghts generally) is logical consistency. No person can consciously believe X and believe not-X in full awareness.</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Consistency: Consistent/Coherent norms trump inconsistent/incoherent norms (This is required for all other constituive features to have force). Without a concern for consistency, an agent could not count as a normative reasoning agent. The very activity of normative reasoning is to address conflicts in motivations.</li>
  <li>Soundness: Norms endorsed under a sound state of mind trump norms endorsed under psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc.</li>
  <li>Deliberation: Norms endorsed under deliberation trump unreflective dispositions that we discard under deliberation.</li>
  <li>Experience: Norms that maintain endorsement upon experiencing their outcome trump ends which are not.</li>
  <li>Full Information: Norms endorsed with full information trump norms based on false beliefs?</li>
</ol>

<p>Stability?
Commonality?</p>

<p><strong>Epistemic</strong></p>

<p>The normativity of beliefs (against people who think the normativity of beliefs just reduce to their truth, so normativity is descriptive):</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are all familiar with the idea of justifying beliefs. I.e. people who believe in Santa Clause who are exposed to the appropriate evidence have unjustified beliefs, people who believe in God (or lack belief if youâ€™re religious), people with opposing beliefs about the efficacy of gun control, etc.</li>
  <li>Justification and truth are separate concepts, i.e. a belief can be justified yet false or unjustified yet true. So justification cannot be descriptive, as it is not concerned with truth.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Normative principles come prior to descriptive beliefs. We need normative principles to establish descriptive beliefs. We need a procedure to proceed from evidential input - i.e. sensory perceptions, memories, intuitions, etc. - to belief outputs. We must establish what counts as evidence to make this inference. Deductive reasoning is required at a minimum. But this is not sufficient, we need induction, abduction, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Deductive:
    <ul>
      <li>Basic constistency: we cannot believe P and ~P.</li>
      <li>Logical rules of inference: if P-&gt;Q and P, then Q.</li>
      <li>Constraints on thought. We cannot help but follow logical constraints in our thinking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subjective:
    <ul>
      <li>Perceptions/memories: the reason that a perception that p provides one with reason to believe that p is because part of what it is to perceive p is to acquire an unreflective belief that p. If perceptions didnâ€™t provide one with an unreflective belief that p, then perceiving that p would be like imagining that p, and this would not provide one with a reason to believe p. Similar considerations apply to memories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Abduction:
    <ul>
      <li>Falsifiability</li>
      <li>Generality</li>
      <li>Parisomony (Occamâ€™s Razor)</li>
      <li>Explanatory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Induction:
    <ul>
      <li>Past -&gt; Future</li>
      <li>Observed -&gt; Unobserved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are either:
	- Constraints on our thoughts. We cannot help but believe them. Or,
	- Things we donâ€™t <em>have</em> to trust, but which we just so happen to do. This isnâ€™t just something that individuals happen to trust, but that everyone happens to trust. If there were beings that didnâ€™t abide by induction or abduction, then we wouldnâ€™t call them irrational; they just wouldnâ€™t have cognitive structures like our own. Normativity only deals with resolving conflicts. Thus, if induction, abduction, etc. are already adopted by most people, then we donâ€™t need to justify them.</p>

<p>This seems to be too low of a standard. It seems we can still question the validity of a belief system that is internally coherent and held by everyone else. E.g. think about beliefs about God back when everyone was religious. Why is this unjustified? Appeal to a more foundational principle that we all intuitive adopt, which is abduction. How do we know that abduction is more foundational than beliefs about God? (1) abduction is not a belief in that it is representation; it is a framework for establishing representations. (2) God is something we come to believe after engaging in abduction. (3) everyone participates in abduction, not everyone participates in believing God. Someone might say that they specifically place God on a more foundational level than abduction, but then their position wouldnâ€™t be reasonable for other people. And usually, when we say X provides a reason to believe Y in circumstances C, we take that to be a universal claim, i.e. <em>every</em> agent has reason to take X to provide reason to believe Y in circumstances C.</p>

<p>Reason is purely procedural. It is concerned with amelierating <em>conflicts</em> and striving for <em>coherence</em> of our aims. Beliefs are not justified in isolation. Rather they are justified based on their coherence with other beliefs. It may seem that all propositions must be justified in a non-circular non-infinite regress, and any beliefs that cannot be justified are irrational. This is the case only because of the context of ordinary uses of â€œrationalâ€ or â€œirrationalâ€. When we talk of â€œrationalâ€ in the context of a debate, it usually applied to propositions that can be justified to all parties involved. However, even though propositions may not be justifiable in this sense (in the sense of collective support), they can justifiable to an individual (based on their coherence with the individualâ€™s other beliefs). The â€œrationalâ€ sense as used in collective support is not constituitive of rationality itself (i.e. agents can be rational without jutsifying themselves to others), but having debates with others implicitly commits oneself to a constructed â€œgameâ€ where the rules are intersubjective justifiability.</p>

<p>Objectivity: imagine people have widely divergent beliefs. Objectivity is possible when there happens to be an intersection in the beliefs held by these people. More specifically, itâ€™s possible when there is an intersection in what these people judge to be solid methods for establishing truth. E.g. think of science. People might have widely different beliefs. But everyone agrees that oneâ€™s beliefs should cohere with their other beliefs, and we happen to be beings with sensory inputs that automatically impress beliefs within us (which means our beliefs must cohere with our sensory inputs), and our sensory inputs happen to converge a lot of the time. There are other features we happen to agree with as well (or can be shown to agree with), e.g. repeated observations from different independent sources/experiments provide more evidence for a hypothesis than one-offs, etc. It is this convergence that grounds the objectivity of science. I.e. two people might disagree over whether theory X or Y is true, but they can agree on method for determining whether X or Y is true, e.g. by appealing to observation, abduction, induction. Without this, objectivity is impossible. Even if we disagree on method, we can ideally point to a meta-principle that we both agree with (or can be shown to agree with) that settles which method is valid (e.g. reflective equilibrium).</p>

<p>Methodology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no exhaustive general principles. There are only procedures for establishing principles and truths. Procedure -&gt; Principles -&gt; Truth.</li>
  <li>Conflicts must be handled by (1) reflective equilibrium - checking coherence with other beliefs/truths, and (2) by appeal to higher level principles that are agreed upon. Applies to individual beliefs and interpersonal disagreement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prudential</strong></p>

<p>Constructivism provides an easy explanation of the following norms of practical reasoning.</p>

<p>Constitutive Features</p>

<ol>
  <li>End-Satisfaction: agents have reason to satisfy their ends.</li>
  <li>Instrumental: agents have reason to adopt the means to satisfy their ends.</li>
  <li>Time: agents have reason to satisfy the goals of their future self. 
 Agents justified in criticizing the goals of our past selves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other Features. May not be constitutive (?), but depend on features implicit in most people</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conflict: how to deal with conflicting goals? 
 Is there a goal hierarchy? 
 Ends constitutive of oneâ€™s identity (i.e. valuing reflection) trump conflicting ends.</li>
  <li>Feasibility: goals which are more likely to be satisfied trump equivalent goals that cannot be satisfied.</li>
  <li>Pain/Suffering: pain/suffering provides one with reason to avoid it is precisely because people judge that they have reason to avoid it (or they have an unreflective aversion towards it). 
 If a person had no (un)reflective aversion toward pain, then there would be no actual reason to avoid it. 
 It is not the pure sensation of pain that provides us with reason to avoid it.</li>
  <li>Desires: a desire to X tends to provide one with reason to X because
    <ul>
      <li>people tend to judge that they have reason to X if they desire to X, and</li>
      <li>all intentional actions are done because of some desire; otherwise, they would be involuntary actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="against-consequentialism">Against consequentialism</h3>

<p>For a particular agent, their reasons need not be consequentialist. For example, this is true insofar as the agent accepts that they have reason to hold certain attitudes, attitudes that cannot be reduced to merely promoting some desired state of affairs. For example, an agent might value friendship, meaning they think they have reason to be loyal to their friends, care about their interests, etc. These reasons are not reasons to promote some state of affairs. This would imply that there could be some end state of affairs that would justify them betraying these current reasons to reach that desired state, but this need not be what an agent has reason to do.</p>

<p>In sum, not all reasons are teleological, i.e. all states of affairs are given some amount of weight which can be theoretically quantified which competes against are conflicting states of affairs. Instead, there reasons can be structural, where some features are given zero weight due to higher order reasons.</p>

<p>Kinds of consequentialism:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maximizing - Define some good which can be quantified, we have most reason to act so as to promote that quantity. This can be disproven above.</li>
  <li>Trivial - Rank possible states of affairs according to how you judge yourself to have most reason to act. Have a complete ranking of all the states. Because constructivism is true, we have most reason to promote that state of affairs. This seems trivially true.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

<p>Objectivity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no objectivity in the mind-independence sense. But there is a kind of objectivity in terms of what is constituitive of agency itself. E.g. in order to count as an agent who values anything, they must take themselves to have reason to adopt the means to fulfill their ends, they must value their capacity for agency, etc.</li>
  <li>One might doubt whether this is a important kind of objectivity. They might say: you are cheating by talking about what is valuable after presupposing someone is an agent. This isnâ€™t really interesting.
â€“&gt; Response: this is the same kind of objectivity that we get with deductive reasoning. I.e. the only reason P -&gt; P, ~(P ^ ~P), (P-&gt;Q ^ P) -&gt; Q, etc. is because of what it is to believe a proposition to be true. It is constituitive of belief that one not believe contradictions. Indeed, for â€œagentsâ€ without these tendencies, we wouldnâ€™t be able to rationally persuade them otherwise. But itâ€™s not clear that the concept of â€œrationalityâ€ even applies to them. Theyâ€™re neither rational nor irrational. No one questions the objectivity here:
â€”&gt; One might still question its objectivity because it doesnâ€™t have the mind-independence. In that case, I question if this usage of â€œobjectivityâ€ is interesting or important. What does it take to call something â€œobjectivityâ€? I look to the role that â€œobjectivityâ€ plays in discourse. When we call something objectivity, we apply this to domains of propositions that (1) people can be mistaken about, (2) we can criticize others/ourselves about, (3) we can have improve about, (4) we can disagree about, etc. The characterization given thus far fulfills that role. 
â€”&gt; Speaking of roles, think of normative â€œtruthâ€. When we attribute the predicate TRUE to a normative judgment about what one ought to do, this implies something above and beyond typical desires:
â€”&gt; That that judgment will be more <em>stable</em> than other desires upon reflection. So reflective stability under ideal deliberation is a test for rationality among agents. Reflective stability under idealized <em>conditions</em> can be a test for the <em>reasons</em> of an agent (where the idealized conditions are the conditions that an agent endorses under ideal deliberation, i.e. full information, full experience, fully imaginative, etc.). Might stability under idealized social negotiation be a test <em>moral reasons</em>. Stability is one of the reasons why our value of reflection has normative authority over any conflicting unreflective judgments we might have.</li>
  <li>Another â€œkindâ€ of objectivity. It may not be constituitive of agency per se, but it is nearly universal among humans:
â€”&gt; Standing in mutual recognition with other agents (i.e. being a moral agent). As an agent, one doesnâ€™t <em>have</em> to care about this. But almost all agents do. Because for the ones who did not, they would have had a difficult time spreading their genes. Of course, evolutionarily, the circle of mutual recognition was often small, limited to oneâ€™s tribe or in-group. But we have the rational capacity to question whether differences between tribes are actually relevant, and most will conclude that they are not. This is not only evolutionarily necessary, it is also neurologically necessary for all current humans. Humans who are not touched and played with as infants either die or grow to have developmental disorders.
â€”&gt; A similar non-constituitive â€œtendencyâ€ that agents have is to value the values of their future self. This need not be constituitive of agency. However, it is near-universal among humans for very similar reasons as being a moral agent. For those who did not, they would have had a difficult time spreading their genes. Of course, our tendency to plan for the future is often limited based on certain factors (i.e. impulsivity, excitement, etc.), but we can question whether those considerations are rationally relevant, and most will conclude that they are not. [there is a further question as to whether caring for future selves commits one to care about other persons. This is a question I will not answer].</li>
  <li>Different kinds of constituitive features:
â€”&gt; Constituitive of psychological attitudes: Fear -&gt; Attributions of danger
â€”&gt; Constituitive of linguistic concepts: thick ethical concepts, coward -&gt; attribution of fear
â€”&gt; Constructed social norms: moral norms -&gt; impartial concern with others. Based on the role or function that the norms plays in our lives. Find the job description of morality. E.g. compare with ettiquette, science, etc. Morality is like thick ethical concepts in that sense. For that reason, they can sometimes be used non-motivationally, e.g. someone who sincerely (i.e. not in the â€œinverted commaâ€ sense) says â€œX is a generousâ€ might not have any motivation by focusing on the descriptive component of the thick ethical concept â€œgenerousâ€ - i.e. that he give to others, etc. Likewise, someone can sincerely judge â€œX is wrongâ€ without any motivational by focusing on the thick component of wrongness - i.e. that others have reason to blame one for this, that people motivated to stand in mutual recognition have reason to accept the norm, etc. The thick component here is also normative (i.e. it uses the concept of a reason), but it need not be motivational, because it relates to reasons for other people. So it may just express a disposition for motivation of the speaker in certain counterfactual circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="desire-theories">Desire Theories</h2>

<p>!!! danger â€œDeprecateâ€
	Delete this section. Consider the pros and cons of desire theories when discussing the merits of various forms of internalism.</p>

<p>This examines theories for normative correctness that reduce in some way to an agents desires, whether first-order or higher-order, actual or hypothetical, etc.</p>

<h3 id="humean-model">Humean Model</h3>

<p>The Humean theory of rationality states the following</p>

<p>A has a reason to X if and only if (1) X promotes Aâ€™s desire d and (2) d is not based on any false beliefs. This can be simplified to: A has a reason to X if and only if X promotes a foundational (rather than derivative) desire in A. Desires are then the upshot of the following</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full information</li>
  <li>Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -&gt; Y).</li>
</ul>

<p>Desires can be given three components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A certain positive or negative sensation</li>
  <li>A disposition to promote some state of affairs</li>
  <li>An unreflective normative judgment that one has reason to promote a state of affairs</li>
</ul>

<p>Not clear if an â€œurgeâ€ can be reduced to a sensation/disposition pair.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>These are problems insofar as desires are divorced from normative judgments (e.g. plans, goals, etc.).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normativity of desires: Why would a desire, in terms of just sensations and dispositions, provide someone with reasons for action? Imagine someone had a disposition where they just felt the urge to turn on radios whenever they saw one but they didnâ€™t think they had any reason to do so. Imagine A is injected with a drug that makes him crave the drug much more, and this is his strongest desire by far. Does he have most reason to take the drug?</li>
  <li>Disconnects: Assume the normativity of desires are accounted for. How to account for disconnects between an agentâ€™s reasons and their desires? These disconnects can happen under physical addiction, emotional disturbances, psychological compulsions, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>We sometimes have reasons without corresponding desires - e.g. weakness of will</li>
      <li>We sometimes have desires without corresponding reasons - e.g. addictions</li>
      <li>These cannot be accounted for with full information. There can be degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on oneâ€™s hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would be against coming into contact with germs because of an intrinsic disgust reaction, and they would think, all things else considered, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires. The fact that full information would produce certain responses in people doesnâ€™t make those responses rational.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Priority: Assume the disconnect between reasons and desires is accounted for (perhaps by looking at a mode of desires). On this model, the authority of desires are simply based on their â€œstrengthâ€.
    <ul>
      <li>How does this account for the authority we want to give to categorically superior desires? E.g. the priority of higher-order desires or desires under full experience, reflection, sound state of mind, etc. which may have low strength?</li>
      <li>How can we ground criticisms of fully informed desires that are based on inexperience, lack of reflection, unsound, etc.?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prudence: Why agents have reason to satisfy the desires of their future self?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dispositionalism--sophisticated-humean-model">Dispositionalism / Sophisticated Humean Model</h3>

<p>The idealization for discovering reasons requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end-deliberation. Some other possibilities include. We can supplement the Humean model by incorportating other requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fully Informed</li>
  <li>Correct means-end deliberation.</li>
  <li>Reflection - desires endorsed under reflection have priority over others
    <ul>
      <li>Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Deciding which desires one places most weight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Soundness - free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.</li>
  <li>Fully Experienced - not merely knowledge of a proposition p, but exposure to a stimuli (i.e. a perception, an argument, etc.) that provokes the attitude.</li>
  <li>Systematically unified desires.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons = Full Experience + Full Information + Full Reflection + Sound mental state + â€¦</p>

<p>At bottom, the concern is that we are starting with an agentâ€™s given motivational set and find a sound deliberative route or procedure with the aforemention properties to discover reasons.</p>

<p>Some theories allow the creation/destruction of underived desires. Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only oneâ€™s interests at the expense of others) are irrational. This is because some theories are â€œfully rationalâ€, not merely fully informed, where â€œfully rationalâ€ extends beyond correct ends-means deliberation. This is necessary to handle irrational desires.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>Hasnâ€™t solved the following problems from above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normativity of desires: why do mere sensations/dispositions even under idealized circumstances, in the absence of a normative judgment, provide a reason for action? It doesnâ€™t seem that they do. Instead, we should focus on the normative judgments an agent would make (e.g. their plans, goals), under these idealized conditions.</li>
  <li>Unification: what do these conditions all have in common? It cannot just be that we all desire to satisfy the desires that we would have under these conditions because not everyone has this desire.</li>
  <li>Priority: assume everyone does actually desire the desires they would have under idealized conditions. What gives these desires the priority that they have? On desire-based theories, priority must be determined purely by â€œstrengthâ€ and very often we can have desires that are stronger than our desire to satisfy the desires we would have under idealized conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>??? example â€œIdeal Observerâ€</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith

Ideal agent vs Ideal Observer: *Ideal agent*: an agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of themselves, A+, would desire to X in C. *Ideal Observer*: an ideal agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. 

*Observer-based not agent-based.* The reasons that X has reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X, not whether A+ would desire X. This is because doing otherwise cannot account for reasons under uncertainty. Consider the case when one has reason to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though they have reason to do so.

It's not clear why this means we should focus on observers rather than agents. For example, imagine the case where someone drinks a glass of soda that they believe to be water and they desire to drink water. We can easily say that they have reason to not drink from the glass, even though they do have reason to drink from the glass given the information that they have. In this case, there is no problem with saying someone has most reason to do something which they have no rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs. Likewise, it seems we can say that people don't actually have reason to seek information, but rather they have reason to seek information given their currently held beliefs. There is no problem with saying, for example, that someone lost in the woods has most reason to take route X, even though this is not something which they have a rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs.

**Problems** 

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do? What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis... This, combined with the earlier notes on ideal observer, might be enough to ignore the observer aspect and focus on the agent. We can distinguish what to do under uncertainty versus full information by distinguishing rationality and reasons.
- ~~~They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.~~~ Actually, this can account for rationality in general. The full information requirement is not to account for *rationality*, but to account for *reasons*. It is full information + rationality that provides reasons. The account of rationality is independent from full information, and this account can be extended to other domains.

<h3 id="general-problems">General Problems</h3>

<p>General problems with desire accounts and counterfactual attitude accounts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The elements posited as providing reasons (desires, informed desires, motivations, ideal desires, ideal observerâ€™s desires, etc.) donâ€™t necessarily provide reasons, i.e. when they disconnect with an agentâ€™s normative judgments. Consider a case where dispositionalism (but not constructivism) would say someone has reason. On what grounds can the person be said to have that reason if they are not in some way committed to the action?</li>
  <li>Insofar as they do provide reasons, constructivism explains why they provide reasons, why they matter and a unifying theme explaining the authority of the elements that do matter. E.g. if certain features are constituitive of agency, caring about desires under experience, future desires, etc.</li>
  <li>Constructivism can give a clean general account of all reasons.
    <ul>
      <li>How to give a metaphysical account of reasons for belief? One response is that one has reason to believe P only if they would believe P in circumstance P. How to account for a reason to believe <em>that</em> counterfactual? The response is that one has reason to believe that they would believe P in circumstances C iff they would believe that â€œthey would believe P in circumstances Câ€ in circumstances C. This is circularâ€¦ This may not actually be an issue on the metaphysical/epistemic level. It may still be an issue on the linguistic/psychological level, however.</li>
