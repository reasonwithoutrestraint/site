# A defense of Affirmative Action

Thomas Nagel distinguishes between two forms of affirmative action. "Weak" affirmative action refers to "to special efforts to ensure equal opportunity for members of groups that had been subject to discrimination". This can include public advertisement of positions to be filled, active recruitment of qualified applicants from the formerly excluded groups, and special training programs to help them meet the standards for admission or appointment. "Strong" affirmative action refers to "some degree of definite preference for members of these groups in determining access to positions from which they were formerly excluded." The "weak" vs "strong" distinction has also been referred to as the "minimalist" vs "maximalist" distinction (Beauchamp) or the "procedural" vs "preferential" distinction. As Nagel and Beauchamp note, most people agree that "weak" or "procedural" affirmative action is justified (and perhaps even morally obligatory). However, there is significant controversy regarding "strong" or "preferential" forms of affirmative action. In this post, I will defend "strong or "preferential" affirmative action. Whenever I refer to "affirmative action" for the rest of this post, it will always be in reference to this strong or preferential form.

A few clarifications are in order before proceeding. Firstly, my goal is to defend affirmative action as practiced by the admissions officers of colleges and universities specifically (as opposed to employers and other organizations). Secondly, when I refer to affirmative action, I will specifically refer to affirmative action based on *race*, i.e. admissions policies that give preferential treatment to students of underrepresented racial groups (I will refer to these students as URMs, which stands for underrepresented minorities). Thirdly, my defense of affirmative action is only intended to defend from charges that affirmative action is an unjust form of *racial discrimination*. I will argue that, while affirmative action *does* discriminate against the members of overrepresented racial groups, it is not an *unjust* form of discrimination. Of course, affirmative action might be opposed for other reasons (e.g. perhaps it is empirically ineffective), but that is not my concern here. Lastly, I'm only concerned with affirmative action within the United States.

There are three main arguments commonly invoked to defend affirmative action (Tierney). Firstly, the *compensatory* argument states that URMs should be granted preferential treatment by colleges and universities to compensate for past or historical discrimination against them or members of their racial group. See Thompson (1973) for some compensatory arguments (although her argument focused on the hiring practices of companies). Secondly, the *diversity* argument justifies affirmative action based on the benefits of a more racially diverse student body (e.g. the benefit from being exposed to members of different races). See Nagel (1981) and Beauchamp (1998) for arguments. Lastly, the *corrective* argument claims that preference should be given to URMs in order to better select for the most qualified students (e.g. because a Black student's score on standardized test might be artificially impaired due to disadvantaged schooling, stereotype threat, etc.). See Himma (2001) for some corrective arguments.

There are strong objections to each of these arguments, but I will not be considering any of these objections here (see objections for these arguments in Tierney). I won't be considering any of these objections because I will not (directly) use any of the aforementioned arguments. Instead, I will defend affirmative action by appealing to two other forms of preferential treatment by university admissions that the vast majority of people (including myself) take to be defensible: (1) preferential treatment based on socioeconomic status, and (2) preferential treatment based on non-academic qualities. These two other forms of preferential treatment, I will argue, are relevantly similar to preferential treatment based on race. If I'm correct about this, then if we continue to defend these two other forms of preferential treatment, then we have strong reason to also defend preferential treatment based on race. 

## Preferential treatment based on socioeconomic status

My first argument to defend affirmative action is based on an analogy with preferential treatment to prospective students from lower socioeconomic statuses (SES). The basic structure for this first argument is based on the following:

1. We ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students because such students are disadvantaged.
2. If we ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students because such students are disadvantaged, then we ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs because such students are disadvantaged.
3. Therefore, we ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs because such students are disadvantaged.

I do not believe that a substantial defense of premise 1 is needed. The majority of people believe that universities are morally permitted to grant preferential treatment to low-SES students. In fact, when people defend preferential treatment for URMs on the grounds that such groups are disadvantaged, rarely do people object by denying that disadvantaged students should be given preferential treatment. Rather, the objection is almost always to propose SES-based preferential treatment as a superior alternative to race-based preferential treatment. So these people grant that universities *should* provide preferential treatment to disadvantaged students. I will be assuming most people's intuitions are correct here regarding premise 1: we ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students. Now, the rationale to simultaneously support preferential treatment to low-SES students and oppose preferential treatment to URMs is based on the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs can be at least mostly eradicated by eradicating their disadvantage to their low-SES status. I will argue that this assumption is actually false. This undermines the rationale for treating low-SES and URMs differently in this regard. This suggests that premise 2 is true: if we ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students because such students are disadvantaged, then we ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs because such students are disadvantaged. Thus, since both premise 1 and premise 2 of the above argument are true, as I will argue, the conclusion of the argument follows: we ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs because such students are disadvantaged.

As stated earlier, I will be assuming that premise 1 is true as it doesn't require a substantial defense for most people. This premise posits that low-SES students are disadvantaged. What evidence exists for this claim? It seems to me that the primary evidence is the statistical fact that low-SES students tend to score poorly according to traditional admission standards by universities. For example, the fact that low-SES students tend to have poor SAT scores is evidence that these students are relevantly disadvantaged, which justifies lowering SAT admission standards for such students. If low-SES students did *not* have poor standardized test scores, then there would be very little evidence that low-SES students are relevantly disadvantaged. In other words, the fact that a particular group scores relatively poorly according to traditional admission standards is evidence that the group is disadvantaged.

If that is correct, then, in order to determine whether the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status, we should determine whether URMs tend to perform worse according to traditional admission standards after controlling for SES. It turns out that this is not the case. URMs perform significantly worse on standardized test scores *even after* controlling for SES. For example, most of the Black-White gap in SAT scores remains even after controlling for income. In fact, in 2005, the Black-White gap in SAT scores was 204 points, but the mean SAT score for Whites from families earning less than $10,000 was 129 points higher than the mean SAT score for *all* Blacks [[sourcel](http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html)]. Also, studies find that racial disparities in other measures of cognitive ability are not eliminated after controlling for SES. For example, in _The Black-White Test Score Gap_, [Jencks and Phillips (1998)]([https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)) measured the scores of Black and White children taking the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The Black children scored about 16 points lower than the White children on these tests. However, the authors report that "a two-year reduction in the black-white education gap among mothers would cut the PPVT gap by about a point" (page 22), "eliminating black-white income differences would cut the PPVT gap by less than 1 point" (page 23) and "children who have grown up in an intact family score no higher on the PPVT than children from single-parent families" (page 23). This shows that controlling for traditional measures of SES - e.g. income, parental education, family structure - does not eliminate the majority of the Black-White gap on standardized test performance. In fact, it seems to have a fairly minor impact.

In other words, the disadvantage faced by URMs persists even after controlling for SES (at least for Black students. I assume similar patterns can be found for other disadvantaged groups). But recall that the rationale to simultaneously support preferential treatment to low-SES students and oppose preferential treatment to URMs is based on the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly eliminated after controlling for SES. Since this rationale rests on a false empirical assumption, we are left without a rationale to oppose preferential treatment to URMs if we support preferential treatment based on low-SES status. In the absence of a rationale to simultaneously support preferential treatment to low-SES students and oppose preferential treatment to URMs, we ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs (assuming we ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students). Since we ought not oppose preferential treatment to low-SES students because they are disadvantaged, we also ought not oppose preferential treatment to URMs because they are disadvantaged.

Note that this argument is agnostic with respect to the particular rationale used to justify preferential treatment to disadvantaged students. One might give either a corrective, compensatory or diversity rationale. Whichever rationale is used, a similar rationale should apply to URMs since their disadvantage persists even after controlling for SES. My argument is also agnostic with respect to the *explanation* of the disadvantages faced by URMs. For example, there is a lively debate about the degree to which the disadvantage experienced by URMs can be explained by environments vs genes. Again, I make no claims on this debate here. Either explanation can probably also be applied to the disadvantage faced by low-SES students (especially since intelligence is influenced by both environment and genes). Thus, if universities are morally permitted to grant preferential treatment to low-SES students on the basis of their disadvantage (regardless of whether that disadvantage is caused by disadvantaged environments or genes), then universities are also morally permitted to grant preferential treatment to URMs on the basis of their disadvantage (regardless of whether that disadvantage is caused by disadvantaged environments or genes).

## The freedom to discriminate

My other argument for affirmative action is based on a general freedom to discriminate that I believe all private persons and companies should be afforded. Before giving the arguments, I would like to note two caveats. Firstly, because these freedoms only apply to _private_ entities (governments should not have the same freedom to discriminate that private individuals should have), my argument here is limited to *private* universities. Secondly, this argument only defends the *legal* right to discriminate; it is not sufficient to defend the *moral permissibility* of such discrimination. Call this the *Freedom Argument*. The basic structure is as follows:

1. We ought to grant private entities the legal freedom to discriminate based on any features that they prefer, except in cases where we are provided with sufficiently strong reasons to restrict such freedoms.
2. We have not been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict private universities' freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race. 
3. Therefore, we ought to grant private universities the freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race (i.e. affirmative action).

Like my first argument, it seems to me that the first premise of the *Freedom Argument* does not require much defense. Note that this premise does not imply that all instances of discrimination ought to be permitted. This premise only establishes that in a moral dispute concerning whether to legally permit an instance of discrimination, the party who endorses outlawing such discrimination has the *burden* to provide sufficiently strong reasons to deny the legal freedom (this is similar to the "burden of proof" in epistemic disputes: in epistemic disputes concerning what to believe, the party who advances the stronger claim has the *burden of proof* to be met). In the absence of any sufficiently strong reasons that meet this burden, we ought to grant the private entity the freedom to practice the discrimination. 

This first premise must be accepted for essentially any private corportation to feasibly operate. All employers discriminate between applicants on the basis of skill, knowledge, traits, etc. Universities also discriminate on the basis of academic achievement, intelligence, extra-curricular activities, athletic ability, etc. We need to be given strong reasons before we outlaw a particular form of discrimination, but we do not need strong reasons before we legally permit a particular form of discrimination. As a *default*, all forms of discrimination should be permitted; we require positive reasons to override this default in any particular case. Again, I doubt that most people oppose this first premise, so I will not spend more time defending it. The controversy, then, concerns the truth of premise 2, i.e. whether we have been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict private universities' freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race. In this section, I will consider some possible reasons that challenge premise 2. In the end, I will argue that all such reasons fail. Thus, I will argue, we ought to grant private universities the freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race due to the *Freedom Argument*.

### Bad reasons

To start, it may be useful to consider some obviously bad reasons to justify outlawing affirmative action.

1. Affirmative action is against the law. This is a straightforwardly bad argument from legality which can be easily dismissed. The fact that the law permits or forbids certain conduct does not demonstrate that such conduct _should_ be permitted or forbidden. To say otherwise implies that the law should never change, which is absurd. I'm sure I don't need to list examples of laws that should (or should have been) changed.
2. The public disaproves of affirmative action. This argument is bad because society can be _wrong_ in their approval or disapproval. To say otherwise implies that society should never change its current norms for approval or disapproval, which is clearly absurd. Again, I need not list examples where society should change (or should have changed) its norms for approval and disapproval. But even if society is correct to disapprove of affirmative action, that does not imply that affirmative action should be banned. For example, society should disapprove of adulterers, but this does not imply that adultery should be illegal.
3. Universities benefit heavily from the government. This reason is just as bad as the previous reasons but I've heard it too many times to ignore. The reasoning goes: private universities (and other private institutions) benefit from the government because in the form of government-subsidized police protection, military protection, economic regulations, etc. all of which are necessary for such institutions to prosper. Therefore, the argument goes, the government is permitted to ban private institutions from practicing affirmative action (or discriminating against any of the "protected classes" that the government decides). This is a really bad argument. A similar argument can be used to show that the government is permitted to ban, say, interracial marriage. After all, private _individuals_ benefit from the government just as much as private companies. Further, surely there are _some_ aspects of an institution's conduct that should _not_ be controlled by the government (e.g. whether a sports apparel store sells basketball jerseys or football jerseys). These examples show that the fact that the government provides a benefit over an entity does not tell us how the government should regulate that entity. 

### Racial discrimination

Someone might oppose affirmative action because it is specifically _racial_ discrimination. Such an argument might go as follows. Affirmative action is an instance of racial discrimination. All instances of *racial* discrimination ought to be forbidden. Therefore, affirmative action ought to be forbidden. Call this the *Racial Discrimination Argument* against affirmative action.

The *Racial Discrimination Argument* might seem intuitive on first inspection, but it is clearly unsound on closer examination. There are plenty of instances of racial discrimination that should not be forbidden. For example, casting directors for movies and plays constantly discriminate prospective actors and actresses constantly based on race. I highly doubt that the vast majority of people would oppose such instances of racial discrimination. I will be assuming that the intuitions of most people are correct in this case: there are instances of racial discrimination by casting directors that are not morally wrong and that should not be forbidden. So the *Racial Discrimination Argument* is unsound and therefore fails to establish that affirmative action should be forbidden.

### Arbitrary discrimination

Now someone might respond by saying that affirmative action ought to be opposed (but not racial discrimination by casting directors) because race is an _arbitrary_ feature with respect to university admissions (but it is a _relevant_ feature with respect to movie casting). Racial discrimination by casting directors is relevant because the race of the actors and actresses has a direct influence on the product. On the other hand, one might argue, private universities are only trying to sell a quality education, and the racial makeup of a campus's student body has no direct influence on the quality of the education of its students. Call this the *Arbitrariness Argument* against affirmative action. The argument can be put roughly as follows. (a) Race is an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. (b) All instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits should be forbidden. &#40;c) Affirmative action is discrimination based on the race of prospective. (d) Therefore, affirmative action should be forbidden.

The *Arbitrariness Argument* seems intuitive. It explains why it seems that racial discrimination should almost always be forbidden. The reason is that racial discrimination is almost always arbitrary. Most jobs require you to apply manual labor or process information, which usually has nothing to do with race. But if we imagine cases where race _is_ a relevant characteristic (e.g. casting or movie directors), we see that racial discrimination ought to be permitted. This argument can also explain why discrimination seems morally wrong when it has nothing to do with race. For example, it can explain why it seems like a company should not be allowed to discriminate against candidates based on gender, assuming gender is an arbitrary feature with respect to the position.

To address the *Arbitrariness Argument*, we must first clearly define what is meant by "arbitrary". Let us do so by considering the following scenario. Imagine an employer, Evan, must choose between two candidates for a job, Mark and Lewis. Mark is more qualified than Lewis. However, based on interviews with both candidates, Evan predicts that Lewis, while less qualified, will be considerably more pleasant to be around than Mark because Lewis has a more compatible personality. So Evan hires Lewis over Mark. I believe most people believe that this form of preferential treatment by Evan should be legal, so I will not spend any time defending Evan's right to make this decision. Instead, I will assume that most people's intuitions here are correct: the preferential treatment by Evan should *not* be forbidden. The question is whether the preferential treatment by Evan is *arbitrary*. More specifically, the question is whether the pleasantness of Lewis is an arbitrary trait with respect to his position (using the definition of "arbitrary" as it is used in the *Arbitrariness Argument*). There are two possible answers: either Lewis's pleasantness *is* an arbitrary trait, or Lewis's pleasantness is *not* an arbitrary trait. Either answer, I will argue, implies that the *Arbitrariness Argument* is unsound.

The first possible answer is that Lewis's pleasantness *is* an arbitrary trait. However, if that is true, then Evan's choice of Lewis over Mark would be an instance of arbitrary discrimination that ought not be forbidden. This means that not all instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits ought to be forbidden, which means premise (b) of the *Arbitrariness Argument* is false, rendering the argument unsound.

The second posssible answer is that Lewis's pleasantness is *not* an arbitrary trait. The natural response now is to demand an explanation as to *why* Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. After all, Lewis was the lesser qualified candidate. What else could we mean by "arbitrary trait" if not a trait that does not influence a candidate's qualification? One explanation is to say that Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because what makes a trait arbitrary just depends on the preference of the private entity. So, on this explanation, if an employer has a preference for trait X (where X is intelligence, strength, productivity, or even pleasantness), then X is, by definition, not arbitrary. The problem with this argument is it implies that no preference by a private entity is ever arbitrary. This means that that race is *not* an arbitrary trait of prospective students for universities that practice affirmative action, since such universities clearly have a preference for students of a certain race. This implies that premise (a) of the *Arbitrariness Argument* is false, rednering the argument unsound.

An alternative explanation for why Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait is as follows: Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because the pleasantness of a company's employees advances the company's *economic interests*. The idea is that more pleasant employees will improve the mood of other workers which makes everyone more productive, which ultimately resutls in more economic gains for the company. On this reasoning, if Evan chose Lewis because of a trait that did not advance his economic interests (e.g. because he preferred Lewis's blood type), then this *would* be an arbitrary preference. This kind of explanation seems intuitive. 

However, if we accept this explanation, we should not consider race to be an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. The reason is that the racial makeup of a university's campus *does* advance the economic interests of the university. Private universities don't merely sell libraries and lectures. They also aim to offer a college campus of a certain kind that is appealing to a certain market of prospective students. For example, universities usually promote a racially diverse campus to prospective students. In other words, students are not just the *consumers* of a university; they also play a direct role in creating the _the product_ (in the same way that actors and actresses are related to movies and plays). Thus, the race of prospective students *does* advance the economic interests of (most) private universities, since most private universities wish to sell a college campus with a certain racial makeup to prospective students. Thus, if we assume that a trait is not arbitrary if it advances the economic interests of a company, then *race* is not an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. This implies that premise (a) of the *Arbitrariness Argument* is false, rendering the argument unsound. 

There could be other alternative explanations for why Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. However, it seems to me that the two explanations that I have considered - that no trait is arbirtary if it is desired by an employer and that no trait is arbirtary if it advances the economic interests of a company - are the most plausible explanations. If that's right, then, on any plausible explanation for why Lewis's pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait, the *Arbitrariness Argument* would be unsound, since premise (a) would be false (as I've argued earlier). On the other hand, if Lewis's pleasantness *is* an arbitrary trait, then the *Arbitrariness Argument* would also be unsound, since premise (b) would be false (as I've argued earlier). Thus, we should conclude that the *Arbitrariness Argument* is unsound, since it has at least one false premise (a or b). 

If this still seems unintuitive, consider the fact that many universities already practice a similar form of discrimination in the form of sex-based discrimination. The most extreme form of discrimination of this kind comes from women’s colleges and men’s colleges, universities that only allow students of a certain sex. Most do not intuit such institutions should be outlawed. The reason is that the sexual makeup of the student campus is clearly an essential part of the product that these colleges wish to sell, which means the sex of the students is not arbitrary. No doubt there are also colleges out there that perform sex-based discrimination for the opposite goal, to maintain a roughly even male:female on campus. People don’t intuit that sex-based discrimination from such universities is morally wrong (I would argue) because it’s not  _arbitrary_  discrimination. I see no reason to treat race-based discrimination any differently.

### Deprivation

In the previous section, I argued that the _Arbitrariness Argument_ fails because affirmative action is not arbitrary because the racial makeup of a university's campus is relevant to the university's economic goals. In actuality, I don't believe that arbitrariness matters at all. Even if race is a completely arbitrary characteristic with respect to a university, private universities should still be permitted to practice affirmative action. Why should a private institution not be permitted to discriminate on arbitrary grounds? After all, these institutions are (and should be) permitted to make all kinds of arbitrary decisions. For example, a sports apparel store decision to sell basketball versus football sportswear, a baker's decision to sell strawberry versus chocolate cake, a restuarant's decision to offer hamburgers versus tacos, etc. could very well be arbitrary decisions. Assuming these are all arbitrary decisions, should the government force the company to make a particular choice? Of course not.

So what makes arbitrary decisions regarding _discrimination_ special? Why treat this differently than the countless other arbitrary decisions by a company that are permissible? Surely, it can't be because of societal disapproval since, as I mentioned above, society's current norms of approval and disapproval cannot constitute reasons to ban certain conduct. Instead, what makes discrimination special, I believe, is the fact that it can be used as a tool to perpetuate the deprivation of disenfranchised minority populations. If there is rampant discrimination against a particular minor group, then this can leave individuals in that group without access to vital goods such as healthcare, education, occupation, housing, etc. The result of this can be sustained generational impovershment and deprivation. In fact, I would say that the historical assocation discrimination against Blacks in America

Why are these properties important? Why are arbitrariness and balancing versus exclusion relevant considerations that determine whether discrimination is bad? Well, we have to discuss why discrimination is ever bad. We cannot just assume that discrimination is bad sometimes without understanding *why*? In order for anything to be bad, it has to be considerably bad for someone somewhere. Now, note that there's nothing inherent to discrimination that implies that it is considerably bad for someone somewhere, i.e. their life would have to be relevantly damanged (I don't consider upset feelings as relevantly bad, because if that were the case then all discrimination would be bad). So what is it about discrimination that sometimes makes it significantly bad in the relevant manner? The answer has to be that discrimination has historically been used as a tool for racial oppression and subjugation, something that destroyed the lives of many minorities. Thus, we implicitly associate discrimination (which isn't inherently bad) with oppression/subjugation (which is inherently bad, as people's lives are destroyed). That is what makes arbitrariness and balancing versus exclusion relevant factors: in order for discrimination to actually ruin a group's lives, it must be arbitrary and it must be exclusionary. Otherwise, there's no way that it can be harmful. 

Now, racial discrimination would definitely be deemed immoral by most people. But I contend that the intuitions of most people are wrong here. Such a school would *not* be immoral. The intuition that it is immoral can be explained by the deep connection we have between racial *discrimination* and racial *oppression*. We have an immediate disapproving reaction to racial discrimination in schools because this was used as a tool for racial oppression in the past. If we could magically disassociate racial discrimination from racial oppression, then I think our intuitions regarding race-based discrimination would be more in line with our intuitions regarding socially accepted forms of discrimination (e.g. sex-based discrimination at all-male/all-female schools, sexual/racial discrimination by casting directors, sexual balancing at night clubs).

I think the laws enacted during the civil rights era chased morality in the sense that they corrected for the wrongs and damages resulting from governmental systematic racial oppression and they gave racial minorities a fair chance at integrating into society. Therefore, civil rights laws had a deeply moral motivation. However, it doesn't follow from this that all policies prohibited by these laws were themselves immoral. The reason it doesn't follow is that prohibiting some otherwise moral activities might be necessary to accomplish some broader moral goal. For example, I don't think hard drug usage or prostitution is inherently immoral, but outlawing them might be necessary to accomplish a broader moral goal - i.e. to prevent violence and harms that would inevitably occur when these acts are legal. Likewise, I would say racial discrimination by private companies is not inherently immoral, but outlawing them might have been necessary to accomplish a broader moral goal - i.e. to correct for systematic racial injustice and integrate racial minorities into society. 

## Conclusion

I also considered some other arguments earlier in this section that I believe fail to meet this burden. The *Racial Discrimination Argument*, for example, is unsound because there are plenty of instances of discrimination based on race that ought not be forbidden. 

There are, of course, other arguments that could be provided to meet the burden presented in the first premise of the *Freedom Argument*. However, I believe I have considered the most common and plausible arguments for why private universities ought not be granted the freedom to practice affirmative action. I have argued that all such arguments fail. If that's correct, then private universities ought to be granted the freedom to practice affirmative action, at least until we are provided with a new argument that provides sufficiently strong reason to restrict this freedom.

This concludes my defense of affirmative action. Recall from my introduction that this was a "defense" in a fairly limited sense. My goal here was merely to show that affirmative action is not an unjust form of discrimination. If affirmative action ought to be opposed, it is not _because_ it's an unjust form of discrimination. However, affirmative action may very well be worth opposing for other reasons. For example, there is [controversy]([https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/)) regarding whether URMs are actually harmed by affirmative action because of "mismatch theory", which is the idea that affirmative action beneficiaries are inserted into academic environments that teach "above" their ability or preparedness. I make no claims about whether affirmative action ought to be opposed on these grounds. The purpose of this post was merely to argue that affirmative action should not be opposed on the grounds that it is an unjust form of discrimination.

[A Defense of Affirmative Action](http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:KQGIuoeO8_sJ:scholar.google.com/+affirmative+action+philosophy&hl=en&as_sdt=0,48) - Most people would agree that weak or precautionary affirmative action is a good thing, and worth its cost in time and energy. But this does not imply that strong affirmative action is also justified. I shall claim that in the present state of things it is justified, most clearly with respect to blacks...My own view is that while strong affirmative action is intrinsically undesirable, it is a legitimate and perhaps indispensable method of pursuing a goal so important to the national welfare that it can be justified as a temporary, though not short-term, policy for both public and private institutions. In this respect it is like other policies that impose burdens on some for the public good (diversity, "Nagel, by contrast, argued that preferences might work a kind of social good, and without doing violence to justice. Institutions could for one or another good reason properly depart from standard meritocratic selection criteria because the whole system of tying economic reward to earned credentials was itself indefensible.").

[In defense of Affirmative Action](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8304057655993507338&hl=en&as_sdt=0,48) - Affirmative action refers to positive steps taken to hire persons from groups previously and presently discriminated against. Considerable evidence indicates that this discrimination is intractable and cannot be eliminated by the enforcement of laws. Numerical goals and quotas are justified if and only if they are necessary to overcome the discriminatory effects that could not otherwise be eliminated with reasonable efficiency. Many past as well as present policies are justified in this way. (diversity)

[Tierney: The parameters of affirmative action: Equity... - Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5377782310365330956&hl=en&as_sdt=0,48) - This article provides a historical, philosophical, and theoretical analysis of affirmative action in higher education. It begins with the historical basis for affirmative action and the rationale for why it has been needed. The author outlines the philosophy behind affirmative action and its legal ramifications. The article then evaluates the success of affirmative action, outlines the criticisms that have been made of it, and considers alternatives. It is argued that affirmative action goes to the heart of what we mean by public higher education and what we mean by "merit." Although the policy has not succeeded in creating dramatic improvements, it has been consistent with basic assumptions about the meaning of academic community (good overview of arguments; expressed my position as well).

[Discrimination and Disidentification: The Fair-Start Defense of Affirmative Action](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006401619357) - The Fair-Start Defense justifies affirmative action preferences as a response to harms caused by race- and sex-based discrimination. Rather than base a justification for preferences on the traditional appeal to self-esteem, I argue they are justified in virtue of the effects institutional discrimination has on the goals and aspirations of its victims. In particular, I argue that institutional discrimination puts women and blacks at an unfair competitive disadvantage by causing academic disidentification. Affirmative action is justified as a means of negating this unfair disadvantage (corrective).

[Eastland: The Case Against Affirmative Action - Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2734765699087866598&hl=en&as_sdt=0,48) - Merely touting the successes of affirmative action, of course, is to glance at only one side of the ledger. On the other side are substantial costs. When examined in terms of both theory and practice, affirmative action deserves a negative judgment. Affirmative action cannot remain a way of life unless we wish to change for the worse the very essence of what it means to be an American (supported class-based AA; mentions rights-based arguments?).

[Preferential Policies Have Become Toxic](http://www.academia.edu/download/15630539/20110315163924748.pdf#page=72) - What is keeping such [affirmative action] programs in place in spite of growing opposition to them is largely a combination of institutional inertia and a feeling on the part of many people that to favor affirmative action for women and people of color is to be on the side of the angels. I don’t think this is true. The arguments in favor of preferential policies do not withstand critical examination; such policies are unjust, and they are having and can be expected to continue to have very bad consequences (supported class-based AA; mentions outcomes as reason against AA).

### Subjugation

Why are these properties important? Why are arbitrariness and balancing versus exclusion relevant considerations that determine whether discrimination is bad? Well, we have to discuss why discrimination is ever bad. We cannot just assume that discrimination is bad sometimes without understanding *why*? In order for anything to be bad, it has to be considerably bad for someone somewhere. Now, note that there's nothing inherent to discrimination that implies that it is considerably bad for someone somewhere, i.e. their life would have to be relevantly damanged (I don't consider upset feelings as relevantly bad, because if that were the case then all discrimination would be bad). So what is it about discrimination that sometimes makes it significantly bad in the relevant manner? The answer has to be that discrimination has historically been used as a tool for racial oppression and subjugation, something that destroyed the lives of many minorities. Thus, we implicitly associate discrimination (which isn't inherently bad) with oppression/subjugation (which is inherently bad, as people's lives are destroyed). That is what makes arbitrariness and balancing versus exclusion relevant factors: in order for discrimination to actually ruin a group's lives, it must be arbitrary and it must be exclusionary. Otherwise, there's no way that it can be harmful. 

Now, racial discrimination would definitely be deemed immoral by most people. But I contend that the intuitions of most people are wrong here. Such a school would *not* be immoral. The intuition that it is immoral can be explained by the deep connection we have between racial *discrimination* and racial *oppression*. We have an immediate disapproving reaction to racial discrimination in schools because this was used as a tool for racial oppression in the past. If we could magically disassociate racial discrimination from racial oppression, then I think our intuitions regarding race-based discrimination would be more in line with our intuitions regarding socially accepted forms of discrimination (e.g. sex-based discrimination at all-male/all-female schools, sexual/racial discrimination by casting directors, sexual balancing at night clubs).

I think the laws enacted during the civil rights era chased morality in the sense that they corrected for the wrongs and damages resulting from governmental systematic racial oppression and they gave racial minorities a fair chance at integrating into society. Therefore, civil rights laws had a deeply moral motivation. However, it doesn't follow from this that all policies prohibited by these laws were themselves immoral. The reason it doesn't follow is that prohibiting some otherwise moral activities might be necessary to accomplish some broader moral goal. For example, I don't think hard drug usage or prostitution is inherently immoral, but outlawing them might be necessary to accomplish a broader moral goal - i.e. to prevent violence and harms that would inevitably occur when these acts are legal. Likewise, I would say racial discrimination by private companies is not inherently immoral, but outlawing them might have been necessary to accomplish a broader moral goal - i.e. to correct for systematic racial injustice and integrate racial minorities into society.

## Consequences

The problem *with certain implementations of affirmative action* (this qualifier is important) is that it leads to *under*qualified students. This is a problem because admitting underqualified applicants actually hurts the students that it tries to help. Admitting students who don't have the qualifications to succeed is setting them up for failure, and we should not be setting students up for failure. For example, [here's an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVvnTByzTmA) where economist Thomas Sowell shares that the black students at MIT were in the top 10% of the country in terms of mathematics, but they were in the bottom 10% at MIT. The result was that many were on academic probation and one-fourth never graduated. That's absurd. Students who would have otherwise excelled in their environment were struggling just to pass. This is not helping anyone.

For a somewhat more modern example, look at [Harvard University](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/11/18/rejected-asian-students-sue-harvard-over-admissions-that-favor-other-minorities.html). The 2009 study cited notes that "the average Asian American applicant needed a much higher 1460 SAT score to be admitted, a white student with similar GPA and other qualifications only needed a score of 1320, while blacks needed 1010 and Hispanics 1190." Combining that with [these percentile charts](http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2005/02_v&m_composite_percentile_ranks_0506.pdf), Asians were in the 98th percentile, Whites were in the 92nd percentile, Hispanics were in the 77th percentile, and Blacks were in the 48th percentile. These are huge differences and it would be naive to assume that this was the best environment for the underrepresented students to thrive academically. 

If a kid from a disadvantaged background is in the 80th percentile of students, then the most *effective* way for this kid to succeed is to attend an institution that teaches to kids roughly in the 80th percentile. Sending him to an institution that teaches to, say, the 99th percentile will increase the probability that he will switch to a "soft" major and/or drop out. That puts the kid in an even *more* disadvantaged position, all in the ironic pursuit of equality. You might think that academics are not the only valuable attribute of college applicants, and you might be right. But it must be granted that there is a *base threshold* of college readiness that all students should have to meet before being accepted (you seem to grant this in your first paragraph). No doubt this threshold varies from college to college depending on the abilities of each school's student body. Accepting students who do not meet this threshold hurts them more than it helps them. My central claim is that affirmative action is wrong at least insofar as it allows for the acceptance of students that do not meet this threshold of college readiness.

It is not sufficient that the *intentions* of affirmative action are morally justifiable (that's a different concern that I bypass here). It is also necessary to consider the practical *consequences* of affirmative action. Often, discussions of affirmative action focus entirely on the former and none at all on the latter, but both concerns are necessary for good policy. We can't evaluate policy purely from a philosophical normative position. Normative evaluation is only valuable insofar as it guides what our *goal* should be. Once we agree on our *goal*, we have to empirically investigate the consequences of various policies to determine effective methods of achieving that goal. I would like to believe that most agree that our *goal* is to help underrepresented minorities thrive. However, affirmative action (of the kind mentioned here) is not the proper *policy* to accomplish that goal precisely because the consequences are ineffective. College readiness *matters*, and this fact cannot be ignored just because our intentions are good, because the consequences will come to hurt the students in the end.

You might say that certain groups tend to experience pre-university disadvantages that unfairly reduce their performance on traditional measurements of scholarly assessment (e.g. grades, test scores, writing ability, etc.). Okay, I can grant all of that. However, insofar as these disadvantages exist, the fact is that these disadvantages also (albeit unfairly) reduce their college *readiness*. The fact is, accepting unprepared students is not going to erase the lifetime of disadvantages that they have already endured. I grant the disadvantages, but the solution cannot be to add *more* disadvantages by mismatching students to institutions that don't cater to their abilities. The solution must be to remove disadvantages for the next generation and to help disadvantaged students by sending them to institutions that cater to their abilities (whether that be less prestigious universities, community colleges, trade schools, etc.).
