Justified uses of coercion:

Necessary/thin (protecting autonomy):
	Negative Rights: Protecting against direct/intentional hindrances of autonomy
		> Protections from murder, theft, assault, etc. (i.e. minimal protective state)
		> Any institution can protect against these harms; can be implemented on a federal level
		> [QUETION] This only shows that individuals can protect people by coercing VIOLATORS of these rights; it does not show that individuals can therefore coerce EVERYONE, including innocents, (via taxation) for protection.
	Positive Rights: Protecting against indirect/unintional hindrances of autonomy
		> Avoidable: Providing regulations to prevent certain avoidable instances of coercion (e.g. food regulations, workforce regulation, etc.), or providing compensation for so.
		> Unavoidable: Providing compensation for coercion embedded into the institution of private property; e.g. providing compensation for people without natural abilities to prosper/flourish in a capitalist society, but who would have prospered/flourished without such a society.
		> Only people contributing to this indirect harm should be forced to pay. 

Optional (promoting/exercising autonomy):
	Types:
		> Rights/services that everyone implicitly endorse (i.e. prisoner's dilemma)
		> Rights/services that some people reject
	> Since the moral justification for these uses of force are optional, they can only be implemented on a local level, where it would not be inhibiting for people to opt-out. The more substantive and the more invasive they are, the more local they have to be.
	> But they don't have to be so local that 

Some steps:
	1. [HARD] From anarchism to minimal protective state. How to get from [X can coerce Y to stop Y from coercing] to [X can coercive Z for funds in order to coercive Y to stop Y from coercing].
	2. [EASY] From minimal protective state to substantive protective state. From direct instances of coercion (murder) to indirect instances of coercion (pollution, workplace regulation). 
	3. [EASY] From protective state to welfare state. From isolated, individual instances of coercion (murder, pollution) to coercion embedded into society (compensating for untalented people being unable to live).
	4. [HARD] From welfare state to optional uses of coercion

Policitical Philosophy:

-> Exchange with morality:
	
	Questions of what the government is obligated/acceptable to do are questions of what we have obligations/permission to use force to do
	
-> Don't think of government as as 'one institution' per 'nation'; 
	* There are varying degrees of delegated power with varying jurisdictions. 
	* Local vs federal government; federal government vs international power.
	* No reason "Federal Government" has principally special circumstances with which to evaluate

------------------------------------------

1. All countries are entitled to preventing force, theft, fraud, and enforcing contracts.

2. In fact, there could theoretically exist one global government to carry out this issues. The only problems here are practical rather than principled. Anyone can enforce contracts.

3. But imagine that there are three countries: one with the minarchist government described above, one with no government, and one with a socialist government. Imagine that people were free to move easily between these two countries. Imagine that Bob moves into the socialist country. He lives there his entire life, with a high portion of his income going to taxes. Can it be said that Bob suffered an injustice. Of course not. So there's nothing wrong with a socialist government.

4. Objection: but people cannot actually move freely between countries so easily.

5. Objection: but maybe the socialist country was the only country with decent land

6. True, therefore entire countries perhaps cannot be socialist. Rather, smaller local community governments may be socialist. They must be small enough such that (a) people can move easily to other territories in the country without the socialist policies, and such that (b) an unreasonable portion of land is socialist. Thus, large federal governments should ensure that socialist governments never have too wide of scope; rather they should enforce that some portion of the country are subjected to solely minarchist government. With this new form of government, it more mirrors the scenario as imagined in (3).

7. Objection: this ignores those who are born into socialist governments, but do not approve of them.

8. Against Nozick: his argument is:
	1. [premise] D1 is a just distribution.
	2. [premise] All exchanges from D1 to D2 are free (D2 = non-socialist). 
	3. [premise] It is unjust to use force to violate an unjust distribution.
	4. [from 1 & 2] D2 is a just distribution.
	5. [from 3 & 4] Extraneaous taxation in D2 is unjust.

I agree with (1) & (2) and consequently (4). D2 may very well be just. I disagree with the conclusion, thus I disagree with (3). That is, I agree with his premise (2) that all free exchanges are just, but I disagree with his premise (3) that all coerced exchanges are unjust. Some coerced exchanges may be perfectly fine (as seen by our intuitions of 3).

9. Objection: This isn't actually incompatible with Nozick, because there really is no coercion (since people can leave at will). If it's not coercion, then we need to work out coercion. If taxation is not coercion, then perhaps I am a libertarian, but I disagree with what coercion entails.
