I. No descriptive difference between an indeterministic and deterministic world

The events in an indeterministic world could play out the same as our world. 

The two worlds, descriptively, are the same.

Imagine two worlds: 
	one where quantum mechanics is random (current random), 
	one where quantum mechanics is determined, but the events are identical to our own
	This can be generalized to movements of photons, electrons, quarks, etc. all that make up the world.

2 Routes from here:

-> There is no real actual difference in reality
-> We lack epistemic ability to identify if our world is one or the other.

First, the metaphysical difference:
--------------------

II. There is no relevant difference between the two.

Okay, so maybe free will supervene on other facts, facts that are neither logical in nature, nor metaphysical in nature, nor even descriptive in nature.

What is the nature of these facts?

There must be some fact P about indeterministic worlds, that are absent deterministic worlds.

How can this be? If two worlds are descriptively identical, then how could they have different facts?

-> Example: imagine non-physical facts that govern particular physical objects, but whereby the particular physical objects don't exist. 
-> Then in what sense might it be said that those facts hold?
-> It seems facts must be held the same if all of the physical facts are the same 
	* Necessary facts are always fixed
	* In what sense might contingent facts be said to be different

------------------

III: There is no important difference

There is no way to interpret "could have done otherwise" in a way that requires indeterminism

FOUR WORLDS:

W1 - deterministic 	- A did X at time T
W2 - deterministic	- A did Y at time T
W3 - indeterministic	- A did X at time T
W4 - indeterministic	- A did Y at time T

----------------

III.1: There is no metaphysical difference

The difference between W1 & W2 = the difference between W3 & W4.

Incompatiablist:
-> At time T, all the facts about W3 and W4 are the same
-> At time T, all the facts about W1 and W2 are not the same (namely, that certain things are determined) 
-> Note that indetermined facts are not facts

---------------

III.2: Determinism is indetermined

Me:
-> At time T in W1/W2, it is also indetermined as to whether A will do X/Y
-> There might be some fact F = "A is determined to do X"
-> But is the following fact determined to hold?: "Fact F will hold always"

Incompatibalist: 
->

---------------

III.3: If there is some difference, it can have no implication on moral.

There's a lot of place to limit scope when discussing whether A could have done otherwise. The question is what are we holding fixed

-> Hold fixed his circumstances, allowing changes in will (compatibalist position)
-> Hold fixed his character 
-> Hold fixed all descriptive facts
-> Hold fixed all facts, including deterministic facts (incompatibalist position)

Examples of moral difference:
-> ....

None of these cases fit the current example
