title: "The early emergence of black-white disparities"
---

Most people are aware of the significant disparities between blacks and whites regarding a wide range of important social outcomes, including crime, income, education, poverty, single-mother households, etc. I have written extensively on [racial disparities in crime](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/) and on the degree to which [disparities in IQ](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/) explain many of the important racial disparities. In this post, I will review studies and data that show that many of these disparities emerge extremely early in life. Specifically, I will investigate racial disparities in IQ, cognitive skills, misconduct, and self-regulation. Black-white disparities along each of these metrics emerge at preschool age or earlier. The black-white disparities gradually grow as children age until the magnitude of the disparities eventually mirror the gaps found between black and white adults.

### IQ

In [past posts](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/), I have written extensively on the importance of the racial IQ gap in explaining racial disparities in a variety of important of social outcomes, such as income, education, crime, and occupation. For example, [Strenze (2007)](https://esferaarmilar.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200616015146/https://esferaarmilar.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf)] showed that education, occupation, and income correlate more with IQ than with parental SES, parental income, parental education, and father’s occupation (table 1). [Gottfredson (1998)](https://analyseeconomique.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-general-intelligence-factor.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200617033802/https://analyseeconomique.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-general-intelligence-factor.pdf)] showed that youths with IQ of 75–90 are 7 times more likely to be incarcerated than those with IQ of 110–125 (7% vs 1%, page 28). Further, many of the black-white disparities in social outcomes are eliminated after controlling for IQ. For example, [Jencks and Phillips (1998)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200428215546/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)] (page 6) report that, after controlling for age and controlling for those with above-average AFQT scores, the average black male earns 96% of the average white male, and the average black woman earns more than the average white woman. [Murray and Herrnstein (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)] showed that the gap in bachelor degree attainment _reverses_ when we fix to persons with an IQ of 114 (the average IQ of college graduates). Among 29-year-olds, 11% of blacks held bachelor’s degrees compared to 27% of whites. Among persons with an IQ of 114 of the same age, the number rises to 50% for whites and 60% for blacks (page 320). I go into more detail on these disparities in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/race-and-iq/).

Because of the crucial role that the IQ gap plays in explaining many black-white social disparities, it is important to determine how early the black-white IQ gap emerges. The data seems to indicate that the IQ gap between blacks and whites is in full effect (about one standard deviation) sometime before children reach ages 3-6. For example [Gottfredson (1997)](http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200922120858/http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf)] reports that "Racial-ethnic differences in IQ bell curves are essentially the same when youngsters leave high school as when they enter first grade" (page 15). This was a claim published in a very brief 3-page statement that outlines conclusions regarded as mainstream among over 50 experts in intelligence and allied fields. Consider the following:

-   [Rushton and Jensen (2005)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200607132056/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf)] argue that the size of the black-white IQ gap is one standard deviation by the time children reach age 6 (page 241). They cite [Peoples et al. (1995)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016028969590039X) which finds a black-white IQ gap of one standard deviation among 3-year-olds matched on age, gender, birth order, and maternal education. They also cite [Lynn (1996)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0191886995001581) which finds a black-white IQ gap of 15.06 points in general cognitive ability in a representative sample of 2.5-6 year olds (table 1). The Lynn study was based on data published for the Differential Ability Scale (DAS) which measures general cognitive ability, verbal ability, non-verbal reasoning, and spatial ability.
-   [Gottfredson (2004)](https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/articles/Gottfredson%202004socialconsequences.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301094755/https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/articles/Gottfredson%202004socialconsequences.pdf)] cites a long list of studies measuring mean IQ differences between blacks and whites (Table 1). I will cite the studies that report the gap in standard deviations (SDs) for children aged 6 and younger. Shuey (1966) found IQ gaps of 0.6 SDs (1922-1944) and 1.07 SDs (1945-1966) among children aged 2-6 years. Coleman et al. (1966) found black-white IQ gaps of 0.78 SDs (verbal IQ) and 1.07 SDs (non-verbal IQ) among 1st graders in 1965. The Stanford-Binet IV standardization sample found an IQ gap of 0.86 SDs among children aged 2-6 years in 1986. The DAS standardization sample found IQ gaps of 0.77 SDs (for children aged 2.6-3.5 years) and 1.23 SDs (for children aged 3.6-5.11) among children in 1986. Finally, A study investigating the children of [NLSY](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm) mothers found IQ gaps of 1.2 SDs (for children aged 3-4) and 1.13 SDs (for children aged 5-6) during 1986-1994. Summarizing these findings, the gaps found were 0.6, 1.07, 0.78, 1.07, 0.86, 0.77, 1.23, 1.2, and 1.13 SDs. The mean gap here is 0.97 standard deviations (although don't read too much into this; this doesn't take into account the heterogeneity of the studies, does not weigh by sample size, etc.)

More recent studies tend to have similar findings:

-   [Brooks–Gunn et al. (2003)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S1532480XADS0704_3) examined black-white test score gaps among young children from two data sets. One of the samples involved 315 premature, low birth weight 3 and 5 year olds from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP). The cognitive ability of the children were measured using the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale at age 3 and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) at age 5 (page 242). The standard deviations of scores for the two tests were 16 and 15 points, respectively. The black-white gap was about 20 points on the Stanford-Binet and about 15-18 points on the WPPSI (Table 1). This corresponds to gaps of about one standard deviation (page 244).
-   [Cottrell, Newman, & Roisman (2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Newman9/publication/274900620_Explaining_the_Black-White_Gap_in_Cognitive_Test_Scores_Toward_a_Theory_of_Adverse_Impact/links/590a15bd458515ebb4a51edd/Explaining-the-Black-White-Gap-in-Cognitive-Test-Scores-Toward-a-Theory-of-Adverse-Impact.pdf) examined cognitive ability of children of 1,364 families who participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). General cognitive ability/knowledge (_g_) was measured using the math, vocabulary, and reading ability facets of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R). Researchers find that "Black-White gaps in cognitive test scores are large and pervasive, and are already established by 54 months of age" (page 11). They further report that "between 54 months and 15 years of age, this gap did not significantly increase over time" (page 11). The black-white gap in _g_ ranged from around 1.2 and 1.4 standard deviations during this time period (page 11).

With all this data converging on around the same mean IQ gap (one standard deviation, or about 15 IQ points), It seems safe to say that the IQ gap is in full effect sometime before children reach age 3-6 years. At that point, the gap remains fairly stable over time.

### Other measures of cognitive ability

There have been plenty of studies documenting the early cognitive (non-IQ) gaps between blacks and whites. These studies typically measure achievement gaps in reading and mathematics between black and white children. The general finding is that the gaps are large for these children, although they are often smaller than the IQ gap:

-   [Phillips, Crouse, and Ralph (1998)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-06583-006) meta-analyzed 8 national surveys to examine changes in the black-white achievement gap as children age. They find that the reading gap does not change at all, and the math and vocabulary gaps widen by only 0.2 standard deviations. From first to twelfth grade, the mean black-white gap in mathematics, vocabulary, and reading scores ranged from around 0.8 to 1 standard deviation (table 7A-1). The authors also report that about half of the math and reading gaps at the end of high school is due to their lower initial skills at first grade and the other half is due to the fact that blacks learn less than whites who enter school with similar initial skills. However, they also note that "neither traditional socioeconomic differences between black and white children’s families nor differences between their schools are sufficient to explain why black children learn less than white children with initially similar skills" (page 256).
-   [Brooks–Gunn et al. (2003)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S1532480XADS0704_3) examined black-white test score gaps among young children from two data sets. The first was a sample of 315 premature, low birth weight 3 and 5 year olds from the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP). The second was a nationally representative sample of 2,220 3 to 4 year olds and 1,354 5 to 6 year olds from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth-Child Supplement (NLSY-CS). Both datasets included measures of verbal receptive ability tests using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Revised (PPVT–R) at ages 3 and 5. The standard deviation of scores for the PPVT–R was 15 points (page 242). The black-white PPVT–R score gaps at age 3 and 5 were about 17 to 25 points, depending on the age and sample (Table 2). That corresponds to gaps of between 1.1 and 1.7 standard deviations.
-   [Farkas and Beron (2004)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222077713_The_Detailed_Age_Trajectory_of_Oral_Vocabulary_Knowledge_Differences_by_Class_and_Race) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200408081138/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222077713_The_Detailed_Age_Trajectory_of_Oral_Vocabulary_Knowledge_Differences_by_Class_and_Race)] investigated oral vocabulary (PPVT) scores for black and white children by age. They found (page 477) that "Beginning with the earliest observation at 36 months of age, Whites average significantly higher scores than African-Americans. This pattern is consistent over the full age span, with the White lead remaining significant through 13 years of age. To see how very substantial this vocabulary gap is, note that Whites cross the 40-word level at approximately 50 months of age, whereas African-Americans do not reach this level until approximately 63 months, which puts them 13 months, or more than one year, behind in vocabulary development."
-   [Fryer and Levitt (2005)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w11049) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200831030013/https://www.nber.org/papers/w11049.pdf)] analyzed 1998 data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 children entering kindergarten (page 5). In the longitudinal study, children were administered standardized tests in the fall and spring of kindergarten, spring of first grade, and spring of third grade. The results revealed that "Black children enter school substantially behind their white counterparts in reading and math." Specifically, in the fall of kindergarten, the black-white gap was 0.663 and 0.400 standard deviations on the math exams and reading exams, respectively.
-   [Murnane, Willett, Bub, and McCartney (2006)](https://research.steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/001/750/4%20Understanding%20trends%20in%20Black-White%20achievement%20gap%20--%20Murnane%20et%20al%202006.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200907232946/https://research.steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/001/750/4%20Understanding%20trends%20in%20Black-White%20achievement%20gap%20--%20Murnane%20et%20al%202006.pdf)] examined the black-white test score gap using two longitudinal datasets – the kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) and the National Institute of Child Health (NICHD). The NICHD measured children's skill in mathematics and English Language Arts (ELA) when they were 54 months, just prior to kindergarten (page 101). Similar measures were taken for the children in the ECLS-K, except that were measured just after the start of kindergarten. In the NICHD sample, the black-white gaps in mathematics and ELA were about one standard deviation at 54 months (page 109-110). In the ECLS-K sample, the gaps were about 0.64 and 0.4 standard deviations, respectively, at the start of kindergarten (page 110).
-   [Yeung and Pfeiffer (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X08001129) examined data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and its two waves of Child Development Supplements (CDS). Yeung and Pfeiffer used used a sample of 1794 children, including 856 blacks and 938 whites (page 417). The Researcher studied three cohorts of children who were tested at two points in time – once in 1997 and once in 2003. Cognitive skills are measured with the Woodcock Johnson achievement test-revised, with the applied problem score as an indicator of the child’s math skills and the letter–word test as a measure of children’s verbal skills (page 417). The authors note that, "before children start formal schooling, black children score about 0.78 and 0.43 standard deviations lower than whites on applied problem and letter–word tests, respectively" (page 424).

It is clear that all studies find large achievement gaps, with some studies even finding gaps larger than the IQ gap. However, other studies also find much lower achievement gaps. [Gottfredson (2004)](https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/articles/Gottfredson%202004socialconsequences.pdf) also finds that the achievement gap is smaller than the IQ gap (Table 6). She posits that one explanation for the lower achievement gaps (compared to the IQ gap) is that the correlation between IQ and achievement is not perfect (page 30). Another explanation might be the fact that achievement tests are less g-loaded than IQ tests and the gap tends to be larger on more g-loaded tests ([Neisser et al. 1996](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf), page 93; [Nijenhuis and Van den Hoek 2016](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/4/2/6/htm), table 3). One finding that supports this hypothesis is the fact that the mathematics achievement gap appears to be larger than the reading achievement gap in most of these studies. This might be explained by the fact that mathematics tests tend to be more g-loaded than reading tests. Regardless, it is fair to conclude that the achievement gap between blacks and whites is substantial and appears before children reach 1st grade.

For direct data reading achievement gaps, consider data from the [Early Childhood Longitudinal Study](https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/) (ECLS), a program sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The program includes 4 longitudinal studies that examine children’s knowledge, skills, and socioemotional development throughout elementary school. One particularly interesting study, the [ECLS-B](https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/birth.asp), provides information on cognitive and motor skills at 9 months, 2 years, and 4 years of age across a nationally representative sample of approximately 14,000 children born in the U.S. in 2001. This information is disaggregated by race and published on their [official website](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables_2.asp#Ch2Sub20). The results are as follows:

-   At [about 9 months of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.10.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905225249/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.10.asp)], white children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, a greater percentage of white children demonstrated ability to explore objects with a purpose (84.0% vs 80.8%), proficiency in communication through diverse nonverbal sounds and gestures (30.4% vs 27.8%), and proficiency in engaging in early problem solving (3.9% vs 3.3%). In contrast, black children outperformed white children on every measure of motor skill. For example, compared to white children, a greater percentage of black children demonstrated proficiency in being able to use visual tracking to guide hand movements to pick up a small object (91% vs 88.8%), proficiency in ability to engage in various prewalking types of mobility (69.7% vs 63.8%), and proficiency in ability to walk with help and to stand independently (22.8% vs 18.0%).
-   At [about 2 years of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.20.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.20.asp)], the exact same patterns were found, only this time the cognitive disparities were more pronounced. White children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, a greater percentage of white children demonstrated ability to recognize and understand spoken words or to indicate a named object by pointing (88.7% vs 79.4%), verbal expressiveness using gestures, words, and sentences (70.7% vs 55.7%), ability to understand actions depicted by a story, in pictures, or by verbal instructions, and proficiency in engaging in early problem solving (42.2% vs 29.9%), and ability to match objects by their properties (e.g., color) or differentiate one object from another (37.1% vs 25.5%). In contrast, black children outperformed white children on every measure of motor skill. For example, compared to white children, a greater percentage of black children demonstrated ability to use fine motor control with hands (58.0% vs 55.8%) and ability to walk up and down stairs (50.2% vs 48.4%).
-   Finally, at [about 4 years of age](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.30.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905225118/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.30.asp)], we again found similar patterns regarding cognitive skills. White children outperformed black children on every measure of cognitive skill. For example, compared to black children, white children achieved higher average early reading scale scores (27.4 vs 22.9) and mathematics scale scores (31.6 vs 26.9), and a greater percentage of white children were able to name the colors of five pictured objects (71.0% vs 55.3%). However, unlike the results from the earlier followups, black children did not outperform white children in motor skills. In fact, white children had a slightly greater average fine motor score (3.5 vs 3.2).

A more recent longitudinal study by the ECLS measured child reading and mathematics scores from kindergarten to fifth grade. The results were consistent with the results presented earlier:

-   In 2010, black kindergarteners had lower [reading scores](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.40.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905231355/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.40.asp)] as early as the fall of kindergarten. Specifically, the black-white reading score gap was 3.1 points (SD=10.5) in the fall of kindergarten. The gap grew to 4.9 points by the spring (SD=13.2). The gap grew to 7.6 points in the first grade (SD=16.5) and remained fairly stable until the fifth grade. Interestingly, black kindergarteners actually outperformed several other ethnic groups in the fall, including Hispanics (53.0 vs 50.8), Pacific Islanders (53.0 vs 52.7), and American Indians/Alaska Natives (53.0 vs 52.7). However, by the spring of third grade, black children had the lowest reading scores of all ethnic groups.
-   Similar racial gaps of a greater magnitude were found for [mathematics scores](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.41.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200905231354/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.41.asp)]. The black-white mathematics score gap was 6.7 points (SD=10.7) in the fall of kindergarten. The gap grew to 9.3 points by the spring (SD = 12.4). The gap grew to 11.7 points in the first grade (SD=14.4) and 15.7 points in the second grade (SD=16.6). The gap remained fairly stable until the fifth grade where the gap was 16.1 points (SD=15.8). Interestingly, black kindergarteners actually outperformed Hispanics (32.0 vs 31.4) in the fall. However, by the spring of kindergarten, black children had lower mathematics scores than Hispanics and every other ethnic group. To show how significant these gaps are, the black-white mathematics gap was nearly a full standard deviation by second grade (the same magnitude as the black-white IQ gap among adults). The most worrying finding here may be that white and Asian _third_ graders outperform black _fifth_ graders in mathematics.

# Misconduct

----------

I have written extensively on the magnitude of black-white disparities in criminality in [past posts](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/). I will give a brief review here. Data from [FBI crime statistics (2015)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200604013633/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)] shows that despite making up only 13% of the US population, black people commit 36% of violent crime in the US. Even worse, they commit over half of the robberies and murders in the country. Among criminals under the age of 18, black youth commit over 60% of the robberies and murders in the country, and over half of the violent crime. In 2003, the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204936/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf)] (Figure 4) released a report showing that 1 in 3 black males could be expected to go to prison if the current rates of imprisonment had remained unchanged (fortunately, imprisonment rates have decreased since then). [The CDC (2015)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)] reports that homicide is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15-34, with nearly half of deaths for men aged 15-24 the result of homicide (see page 34). Contrast this with white males of the same age for whom homicide causes roughly between 3-5% of deaths (see page 27). In fact, the death rate due to homicides for blacks aged 20-24 (110.8 deaths per 100,000 population) is over _20 times_ the rate for similarly aged whites (5.4 deaths per 100,000 population). I provide more detail on the scope and magnitude of black criminality in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/).

With such stark racial disparities in crime, a natural question is to ask how early these disparities in misbehavior emerge. Racial disparities in suspensions suggest that black children display disproportionate levels of misconduct very early in childhood:

-   A [2010 report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)] by the Southern Poverty Law Center on urban middle schoolers showed that black males are nearly 3 times as likely as white males to be suspended (28.3% vs 10%) [Figure 2]. Black females are over 4 times as likely as white females to be suspended (18% vs 4%) [Figure 2].
-   A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on discipline disparities shows that the racial disparity in suspension rate is not accounted for by controlling for level of school poverty. At every level of school poverty, black students are significantly more likely to be suspended than any other race of students. In fact, the out-of-school suspension rate for black students attending schools with the lowest level of poverty (7.5%) is _higher_ than the rate for white students attending schools with the highest level of poverty (7.3%) [Table 14].

The racial disparity in misconduct appears even at _preschool_:

-   A [2016 article](https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html)] by the LA Times reported that “although black girls represent 20% of preschool enrollment, 54% of preschool girls suspended once or more were black.”
-   A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on discipline disparities shows black preschoolers are over 3 times as likely as white preschoolers to be suspended (1.1% vs 0.3%) [Table 17].

Now, some people might accept these facts but deny that it demonstrates early _misconduct_ by black children. One might argue that this demonstrates only that black children are disproportionately punished for _alleged_ misconduct, but it doesn’t show that they disproportionately _engage_ in misconduct. Such a person might argue that teachers and principals around the country have an anti-black bias when deciding who to punish for alleged misconduct. To this argument, I have a few responses:

-   While black teachers suspend black children at lower rates than white teachers do, they still suspend black children at a rate several times that of white children. For example, white male teachers suspend black male students at 3 times the rate of white male students (15.4% vs 5.2%), and black male teachers suspend black male students at 2.4 times the rate of white male students (12.7% vs 5.3%) [source: see [Figure 2](https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)] [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)]. So if racial differences in suspension rates are due to an anti-black bias, it looks like the same bias is found among black teachers. While this is certainly possible, it is less plausible.
-   A [2014 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)] published in the _Journal of Criminal Justice_ found that prior problem behavior accounts for the racial disparity in school suspensions: “Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature.” The study concludes, “these findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued.” This finding is completely unexpected if we assume teachers had a strong anti-black bias. After all, if a teacher had an anti-black bias, why would she treat black and white students identically if they had comparable histories? Does her anti-black bias magically disappear when she’s considering blacks and whites with the same history? No, the best explanation is that black students are suspended more because they are more likely to misbehave.
-   According to a [report](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200904074024/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp)] by the National Center for Education Statistics, black kindergartners are significantly more likely to _report_ having been physically assaulted by other students. In particular, in 2010, the percentage of first-time black kindergartners who report having been “pushed, shoved, slapped, hit, or kicked other students” (7.9%) was over 6 times greater than the percentage of first-time white kindergartners who report the same (1.2%).

[Bakermans-kranenburg et al. (2004)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223261865_Differences_in_attachment_security_between_African-American_and_white_children_Ethnicity_or_socio-economic_status) examined data from the NICHD Early Childcare Research Network to examine differences in attachment security between 142 black and 1,002 white infants. They found that black children displayed greater levels of misconduct (page 423):

> A set of items indicating children’s compliance showed consistently lower mean scores for the African-American group. African-American children appeared to be less compliant to their mothers’ suggestions or requests, and were less inclined to ‘stop misbehavior when told no’. African-American children showed on average also more active and even rough behavior in the context of play. Play materials were more roughly handled and the children became more easily angry with toys.

# Self-regulation

----------

In a [recent post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/achievement-beyond-iq-childhood-self-regulation/), I reviewed an extensive list of studies showing the robust predictive validity of childhood self-regulation. "Self-regulation" is an umbrella term that covers self-discipline, impulse control, self-control, ability to delay gratification, etc. I showed that self-regulation has strong predictive power for a variety of adulthood outcomes, including high school graduation, college attendance and graduation, criminal offending, single-parent childrearing, etc. In fact, childhood self-regulation maintains this predictive power even after controlling for IQ and parental SES ([Moffitt et al. 2011](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/7/2693.full.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200522115925/https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/7/2693.full.pdf)] and [Fergusson et al. 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800484/)). Further, many studies demonstrated that various components of self-regulation (e.g. self-control) _outdoes_ IQ in predicting a variety of important life outcomes ([Duckworth and Seligman 2005](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.8509&rep=rep1&type=pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200731030428/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.8509&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] and [Duckworth et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782117) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200830225639/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257136260_What_No_Child_Left_Behind_Leaves_Behind_The_Roles_of_IQ_and_Self-Control_in_Predicting_Standardized_Achievement_Test_Scores_and_Report_Card_Grades)]). I provide more studies and go into more detail on these studies in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/achievement-beyond-iq-childhood-self-regulation/). Given the robust predictive validity of childhood self-regulation on adulthood outcomes and given the large black-white disparities in many outcomes associated with self-regulation (e.g. criminal offending, high school graduation, etc.), it will be worthwhile to investigate whether black and white children diverge on measures of self-regulation. In this section, I will review studies which find substantial black-white differences in self-regulation that appear extremely early in life.

[Watts et. al (2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6050075/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200414061022/https://www.parentshop.com.au/important/uploads/Marshmallow-Experiment-Report-2018.pdf)] attempted to replicate the famous marshmallow study by [Shoda et. al (1990)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-06927-001). Researchers examined the relationship between ability to delay gratification at preschoolers and academic and behavioral outcomes at age 15. The ability to delay gratification was measured by presenting the 54-moths-old children with a treat and giving them two options: (a) they could wait 7 minutes before eating the treat, in which case they would eat the treat and get a reward, or (b) they could eat the treat before 7 minutes and get no reward. The measure of delay of gratification was recorded as the number of seconds the child waited (7 minutes being the maximum). The results were as follows:

-   Consistent with other research regarding self-regulation, there was a significant correlation between the ability to delay gratification at age 7 and outcomes at age 15. The correlation between minutes waited and Grade 1 academic achievement among nondegreed mothers was 0.28. The results suggested that children’s Grade 1 achievement would improve by approximately 0.1 standard deviations for every additional minute waited at age 4. Similar correlations were found for age 15 academic achievement (table 4). Even greater was the correlation between the ability to wait 7 minutes and age 15 achievement (r=0.65).
-   Among children of nondegreed mothers (n=552), the black children had significantly lower waiting times than white children. Despite constituting 16% of the children of nondegreed mothers (table 1), they constituted 24% of the children of nondegreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes (table 3). Among nondegreed mothers, 81% of black children (0.24 × 301 / 0.16 × 552) failed to wait for 7 minutes, while only 48% of white children (0.64 × 301 / 0.73 × 552) failed to wait for 7 minutes (552 = total number of children of nondegreed mothers [table 1]; 0.16 (0.73) = proportion of children of nondegreed mothers who are black (white), respectively [table 1]; 0.24 (0.64) = proportion of children of nondegreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes who are black (white) [table 3]). In other words, among chidlren of nondegreed mothers, 52% of white children were able to delay gratification for 7 minutes, whereas only 19% of black children were able to do the same.
-   A similar disparity was found among children of degree mothers (n=336). Despite constituting 2% of the children of degreed mothers (table 1), they constituted 5% of the children of degreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes. Among degreed mothers, 86% of black children (0.05 × 301 / 0.02 × 336) failed to wait for 7 minutes, while only 32% of white children (0.85 × 301 / 0.91 × 336) failed to wait for 7 minutes (336 = total number of children of degreed mothers [table 1]; 0.02 (0.91) = proportion of children of degreed mothers who are black (white), respectively [table 1]; 0.05 (0.85) = proportion of children of degreed mothers who did not wait 7 minutes who are black (white) [table 3]). In other words, among children of degreed mothers, 68% of white children were able to delay gratification for 7 minutes, whereas only 14% of black children were able to do the same.
-   One point worth mentioning is that the association between minutes waited and academic achievement was almost entirely accounted for after controlling child characteristics (gender, race, and birth weight), family background (maternal age and education, and family income), quality of home environment, child temperament at 6 months, child vocabulary at 36 months, child cognitive functioning at 24 months and 36 months, and a variety of measures of cognitive and behavioral skills and problems. This does _not_ disprove the predictive validity of the ability to delay gratification. The reason for this is that the predictive power of ability to delay gratification is likely due to its association with the broader cognitive and behavioral abilities that were included in the aforementioned controls.

[Duckworth et al. (2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782117/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200830225639/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257136260_What_No_Child_Left_Behind_Leaves_Behind_The_Roles_of_IQ_and_Self-Control_in_Predicting_Standardized_Achievement_Test_Scores_and_Report_Card_Grades)] conducted two longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students to compare the relative impacts of self-control and intelligence on standardized test scores and school grades. The results of the studies are as follows:

-   The first study was a data analysis of a sample of the 1,364 students in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD-SECCYD). Self-control and IQ data were collected from participants in the 4th grade. Self-control was measured by reports from the participant’s mother, father, and teacher. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). As expected, both 4th grade IQ and self-control, particularly measured using teacher reports, were significantly associated with later test scores and grades (both teacher-reported self-control and IQ correlated with 8th grade IQ at r=0.44, table 1). The study also found a significant _inverse_ correlation between black and all measures of self-control (table 1). In fact, the negative correlation between black and teacher-reported self-control (the most predictive measure of self-control) was almost as great in magnitude as the negative correlation between black and IQ (r=–0.30 vs r=–0.35).
-   The second study involved 510 5th through 8th grade students at two public schools in New York City. Self-control was measured using reports from homeroom teachers, parents, and students who completed the Impulsivity Scale for Children (ISC) test with students as targets. IQ was measured using scores on the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test. Again, teacher-reported self-control was more predictive of success than other measures of self-control. In fact, teacher-reported self-control outperformed IQ in predicting spring GPA (r=0.55 vs r=0.40) (table 3). Like study 1, this study also found a significant inverse correlation between black and all measures of self-control (table 3). In fact, the negative correlation between black and teacher-reported self-control (the most predictive measure of self-control) was greater in magnitude than the negative correlation between black and IQ (r=–0.18 vs r=–0.12).

[Duncan and Magnuson (2011)](http://sites.uci.edu/gduncan/files/2013/06/Duncan-Magnuson-including-web-appendix-032112.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20181025005738/http://sites.uci.edu/gduncan/files/2013/06/Duncan-Magnuson-including-web-appendix-032112.pdf)] reviewed literature on the “association between early achievement, attention, and behavior and later school achievement and such late-adolescent schooling outcomes as dropping out and college attendance.” As expected, they found that persistent achievement or behavior problems were predictive of outcomes later in life (including, e.g. high school graduation, college attendance, early-adult crime, etc.) (see executive summary). Some of the findings are as follows:

-   Using data from the NLSY, they found significant associations between persistent anti-social and attention problems at ages 6, 8, and 10 and the probability of graduating high school, attending college by age 21/22, and being arrested (tables 3.A10 and 3.A12). Many of these associations disappeared after controlling for an extensive list of covariates, including race, gender, % years in poverty, number of children, parental marital status, mother academic aptitude, etc. (see footnote of table 3.A9 for the full list of controls). However, persistent anti-social behavioral problems impressively maintained a significant association with being arrested despite these controls.
-   Significant black-white gaps in these behavioral problems appear as early as kindergarten and gradually grow until the 5th grade. For example, the black-white gap attention/engagement grows from 0.36 standard deviations (SDs) to 0.44 SDs between the 1st and the 5th grade (Figure 3.3). The black-white gap in anti-social behavior grows from 0.31 SDs to 0.5 SDs between the 1st and the 5th grade (Figure 3.4).

Finally, consider [Elder and Zhou (2017)](https://msu.edu/~telder/Noncog_Skills_Current.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200906060142/https://msu.edu/~telder/Noncog_Skills_Current.pdf)], the one study I found with the expressed purpose of investigating black-white gaps. They analyze data from various cohorts of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) to measure the black-white gap in non-cognitive skills. The study here analyzes three components of non-cognitive skills: "one meant to capture externalizing problem behaviors like arguing and getting into fights, one meant to capture elements of self-control in interacting with peers, and one meant to capture 'approaches to learning', which encompasses attentiveness, task-persistence, and motivation" (page 3). These skills are measured using a variety of teacher reports. The basic results are as follows:

-   White children outperformed black children on all three measures of non-cognitive skills (page 8). The ECLS-K:2011 cohort demonstrated a black-white gap that grew from kindergarten to 3rd grade among all three measures of non-cognitive skills. The gap in approaches to learning grew from 0.33 standard deviations (SDs) to 0.52 SDs, the gap in externalizing problem behaviors grew from 0.40 SDs to 0.52 SDs, and the gap in self-control grew from 0.40 SDs to 0.58 SDs (table 1a, or column 1 of table 5). The ECLS-K:1999 cohort revealed a similar pattern (table 1b). The authors note that “the non-cognitive skill  
    gaps are remarkably stable across cohorts” (page 3), consistent with test score gaps which show that “after declining for decades, the black-white test score gap has remained roughly constant since the early 1990s” (page 3).
-   The authors note that these reported gaps are actually severe _under_-estimates of the actual non-cognitive skill gaps because “teachers’ opinions for what constitutes ‘normal’ levels of achievement and behavior are systematically different in schools with disadvantaged student populations as compared to more advantaged schools” (page 15). After correcting for systematic differences in teachers’ perception of “normal”, the black-white gap in non-cognitive skills grew substantially. For the ECLS-K:2011 cohort, the gap in non-cognitive skills grew from 0.66-0.67 SDs in kindergarten to 0.81-0.83 SDs in 3rd grade (column 3 of table 5).
-   The gaps in non-cognitive skills were partially reduced after controlling for home environment, school environment, and differences in teacher perceptions. The home environment includes paternal education, parental marital status, whether the child lives in a two-parent household, number of books owned by the child, SES composite index, and child birth weight. Specifically, the non-cognitive skill gaps in kindergarten reduced from 0.33-0.40 SDs to 0.24-0.26 SDs after adding these controls (column 5 of table 5). The non-cognitive skill gaps in 3rd grade reduced from 0.52-0.58 SDs to 0.20-0.27 SDs after adding the controls (column 5 of table 5). So these controls accounted for about one-third to one-half of the black-white gaps in non-cognitive skills. In other words, most of the black-white gap in non-cognitive skills persisted, particularly gaps in kindergarten, after accounting for the controls.
