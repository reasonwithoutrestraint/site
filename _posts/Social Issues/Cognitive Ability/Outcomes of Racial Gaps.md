Most people are aware that there are significant disparities between blacks and whites with regard to a wide range of important social outcomes, including crime, income, education, poverty, welfare usage, etc. For almost every measurable metric of success that we find important, blacks perform significantly worse than whites. I will argue in this post that many of these disparities are likely caused by the significant cognitive differences between blacks and whites. I begin by illustrating a few examples of the disparities between blacks and whites. Then I cover the importance of cognitive ability with regard to outcomes such as crime, income, education, etc. Finally, I consider some evidence that many of the gaps between blacks and whites are (mostly) eliminated after controlling for cognitive ability. This post is agnostic with respect to the _cause_ of the cognitive ability gap. See my later posts [here](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/poor-explanations-of-the-black-white-iq-gap/) and [here](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/quantifying-the-genetic-component-of-the-black-white-iq-gap/) for the cause of the gap.

## Racial Inequalities

----------

### Economic disparities

Most people are already aware of the economic disparities between blacks and whites, so I won't get into much more detail on this. I'll just mention a few data points:

-   The [US census data (2017)](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603221731/https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.pdf)] shows that the average black household income is more than one-third lower than the average white household income ($40,258 vs $68,145).
-   The same data shows that black households are also over twice as likely to be poor as white households (21% vs 8.7%).

### Crime and misbehavior

Black people are disproportionately involved in criminality:

-   Data from [FBI crime statistics (2015)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200604013633/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43)] shows that despite making up only 13% of the US population, black people commit 36% of violent crime in the US. Even worse, they commit over half of the robberies and murders in the country. Among criminals under the age of 18, black youth commit over 60% of the robberies and murders in the country, and over half of the violent crime.
-   In 2003, the [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204936/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/piusp01.pdf)] (Figure 4) released a report showing that 1 in 3 black males could be expected to go to prison if the current rates of imprisonment had remained unchanged (fortunately, imprisonment rates have decreased since then).
-   [The CDC (2015)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)] reports that homicide is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15-34, with nearly half of deaths for men aged 15-24 the result of homicide (see page 34). Contrast this with white males of the same age for whom homicide causes roughly between 3-5% of deaths (see page 27). In fact, the death rate due to homicides for blacks aged 20-24 (110.8 deaths per 100,000 population) is over _20 times_ the rate for similarly aged whites (5.4 deaths per 100,000 population).

Disparities in troublesome behavior between blacks and whites appear far before adulthood:

-   Among [middle-schoolers](https://www.splcenter.org/20100831/suspended-education-urban-middle-schools-crisis) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200211211050/https://www.splcenter.org/20100831/suspended-education-urban-middle-schools-crisis)], black males are suspended at 3 times the rate for white males, and black females are suspended at over 4 times the rate for white females.
-   Despite making up just 18% of enrolled preschoolers, [black children account for 48%](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200224182900/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)] of preschool children suspended more than once.

I go into more detail on the racial disparities in crime and misconduct in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-magnitude-and-extent-of-black-criminality/).

### Education

There are also significant racial gaps in academic achievement. Data from the [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) (2019)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_RFA.asp) reports that blacks are about twice as likely as whites to fail to complete High School, and half as likely to attain a bachelor's degree. The academic achievement disparities show up far before High School graduation. At every age-level, black students perform significantly worse than white students on nationally standardized [reading](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_221.90.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200613050623/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_221.90.asp)] and [mathematics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_222.90.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200613050704/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_222.90.asp)] according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). For example, consider the following data points:

-   In 2012, only 70% of black 17-year-olds achieved a NAEP reading score of at least 250 - a score that indicates an ability "to search for specific information, interrelate ideas, and make generalizations about literature, science, and social studies materials". For comparison, 87% of white 17-year-olds and 74% of white _13_-year-olds achieved that score.
-   In that same year, only 1% of black 17-year-olds achieved a mathematics score of at least 350 (the highest score level reported), compared to 9% of white 17-year-olds.
-   Only 34% of black 17-year-olds achieved a mathematics score of 300, which indicates an ability to "perform reasoning and problem solving involving fractions, decimals, percents, elementary geometry, and simple algebra." By contrast, over 70% of white 17-year-olds, and over 41% of white _13_-year-olds surpassed that score. This means that the average black 17-year-old is less proficient in mathematics and reading than the average white 13-year-old.
-   Similar disparities of varying magnitudes are found at every age-level in every state in the country (see [here](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading/state/gaps?grade=8) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200514172248/https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading/state/gaps?grade=8)] for achievement racial gaps by state in 2015). For example, the NCES has released [statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_222.70.asp) on the average NAEP mathematics scale scores of 8th-grade public school students by race and state in 2019. The state with the largest average score for black students was Virginia, which had an average score of 268. This was still 5 points lower than the average white score in the state with the lowest average white score (West Virginia).

### SAT scores

The effects of the gaps are most pronounced at the extremes of the distribution of academic achievement. There are almost no black students among the top students. For example, we find the [following gaps](http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200403114251/http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html)] by race on SAT scores:

> On the math SAT, only 0.7 percent of all black test takers scored at least 700 compared to 6.3 percent of all white test takers. Thus, whites were nine times as likely as blacks to score 700 or above on the math SAT. Overall, there were 45 times as many whites as blacks who scored 700 or above on the math SAT.
> 
> If we raise the top-scoring threshold to students scoring 750 or above on both the math and verbal SAT — a level equal to the mean score of students entering the nation's most selective colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, and CalTech — we find that in the entire country 244 blacks scored 750 or above on the math SAT and 363 black students scored 750 or above on the verbal portion of the test. Nationwide, 33,841 students scored at least 750 on the math test and 30,479 scored at least 750 on the verbal SAT. Therefore, black students made up 0.7 percent of the test takers who scored 750 or above on the math test and 1.2 percent of all test takers who scored 750 or above on the verbal section.

These extreme discrepancies suggest that there are almost no blacks with the academic achievement required for the nation's most elite and prestigious positions. This obviously has significant impacts on the demographics of those with positions of power within the country.

## Why cognitive ability matters

----------

This section will summarize points that I've made about the predictive validity of cognitive ability in a [separate post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/the-predictive-validity-of-cognitive-ability/).

### Background

When I say “cognitive ability”, I’m referring to the definition of “intelligence” given by [Gottfredson (1997)](http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200922120858/http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf)]:

> Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings-“catching on,” “ making sense” of things, or “figuring out” what to do. (page 13)

For a more precise working definition, it may be useful to frame what I mean from the perspective of different theories of intelligence. My working definition of “cognitive ability” corresponds to the visual-spatial, linguistic-verbal, and logical-mathematical forms of intelligence stipulated by Howard Gardner’s [Theory of multiple intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences). It also corresponds to the “analytic” component of intelligence stipulated by Robert Sternberg’s [Triarchic theory of intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triarchic_theory_of_intelligence).

Before proceeding, I must give some background on IQ score distributions. This is necessary in order to understand about how to interpret a given IQ score. IQ scores are normed for a given population to produce a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 points. Because IQ scores are [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), 32% of the population has an IQ score of more than a standard deviation away from the mean. In other words, about 68% of the population has scores between 85 and 115. About 5% of the population has an IQ score of more than two standard deviations (30 points) from the mean. In other words, about 95% of the population has scores between 70 and 130 ([Neisser et al. (1996)](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200531161409/http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf)], page 78). These facts are merely statistical consequences of normal distributions. The [DSM-5](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605084933/https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf)] defines intellectual disability as an IQ score of about 70 or below. "Giftedness" is not a well-defined term but, when defined using IQ scores, it is often defined as possessing an IQ of around 130 or higher ([Gottfredson (1997)](http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200922120858/http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf)], page 13).

An important point to note about cognitive ability is its _reliability_ or _stability_ across an individual’s lifetime. [Neisser et al. (1996)](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200531161409/http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf)] report that “Intelligence test scores are fairly stable during development” (page 81). They note that an individual’s age 17-18 IQ correlates at r=0.86 with their age 5-7 IQ, and correlates at r=0.96 with their age 11-13 IQ. Thus, we can predict with fairly high accuracy a person’s IQ at adulthood once we know their IQ at childhood. Similar points were made by [Gottfredson (1997)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200916184424/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf)] who states that “intelligence is highly stable beginning in childhood” (page 87). Similar points are made by [Sternberg et al. (2001)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert-Sternberg-4/publication/228859220_The_predictive_value_of_IQ/links/09e4150d72ed6b102a000000/The-predictive-value-of-IQ.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20210320234320/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert-Sternberg-4/publication/228859220_The_predictive_value_of_IQ/links/09e4150d72ed6b102a000000/The-predictive-value-of-IQ.pdf)] who makes two observations on IQ correlations between ages from age 3 to age 12: “First, the best predictor of IQ in a given year is the IQ from the previous year. Second, the predictive power of IQ in every subsequent year increases with the child’s age” (page 15).

Also, I must explain what is the _g_ factor. Researchers have discovered that different intelligence tests – e.g. mathematical tests, verbal tests, spatial reasoning tests, etc. – tended to rank individuals in the same way. This suggest that each of these specific tests, in addition to testing for ability in their narrow domain, also tested "some global element of intellectual ability" ([Gottfredson (1998)](https://analyseeconomique.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-general-intelligence-factor.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200617033802/https://analyseeconomique.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-general-intelligence-factor.pdf)], page 24). This global element can be statistically extracted using factor analysis and is referred to as the general factor of intelligence – abbreviated as _g_. Different intelligence tests can be ranked according to their _g_-loading, i.e. according to the degree to which they accurately measure the general factor of intelligence. [Gottfredson (2002)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.7767&rep=rep1&type=pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190426082919/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.7767&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] gives two reasons explaining why tests with high g-loadings are particularly important. Firstly, "more g-loaded ones are more complex, whatever their manifest content" (page 28). Secondly, and more importantly, the more g-loaded a test is, "the better it predicts performance, including school performance, job performance, and income" (page 28). These points have led [Gottfredson (2002)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.7767&rep=rep1&type=pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190426082919/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.7767&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] to forcefully pronounce that (page 27):

> Theorists have long debated the definition of “intelligence,” but that verbal exercise is now moot. g has become the working definition of intelligence for most researchers, because it is a stable, replicable phenomenon that—unlike the IQ score—is independent of the “vehicles” (tests) for measuring it. Researchers are far from fully understanding the physiology and genetics of intelligence, but they can be confident that, whatever its nature, they are studying the same phenomenon when they study g. That was never the case with IQ scores, which fed the unproductive wrangling to “define intelligence.” The task is no longer to define intelligence, but to understand g.

It is important to understand the _g_ factor for several reasons. Firstly, some of the studies that I cite will discuss the _g_ factor specifically (rather than IQ scores) and therefore some background on the _g_ factor will be necessary to understand the results of these studies. Secondly, sometimes direct measurements of IQ scores or _g_ scores will be unavailable for the specific issue of concern. In that case, we can use other mental tests that have high _g_-loadings. For example, the SAT, AFQT, and even vocabulary tests have very high _g_-loadings, which makes them useful as measures of _g_. Thirdly, and most importantly, tests with high _g_-loadings are more predictive of success than tests of low _g_-loadings in most of the outcomes that are of concern. Specifically, high _g_-loaded tests tend to be highly predictive of outcomes in the areas for which there is substantial black-white inequality (e.g. income, occupational prestige, academic performance, educational attainment, etc.).

### Expert consensus

The expert consensus is that cognitive ability (as defined earlier) is a very powerful predictor, often the most powerful predictor, of a number of important social outcomes. See the following reports/surveys.

[Gottfredson (1997)](http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200922120858/http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf)] reports that “IQ is strongly related, probably more so than any other single measurable human trait, to many important educational, occupational, economic, and social outcomes.” (page 14). This was published in a very brief 3-page statement that outlines conclusions regarded as mainstream by over 50 experts in intelligence and allied fields.

[Reeve and Charles (2008)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2008-reeve.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191121225401/https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2008-reeve.pdf)] examined the opinions of 30 experts in the science of mental abilities about their views on cognitive ability and cognitive ability testing. The study found a consensus among experts that general cognitive ability “is measured reasonably well by standardized tests”, that general cognitive ability “enhances performance in all domains of work”, that general cognitive ability “is the most important individual difference variable”, and even that general cognitive ability is “the most important trait determinant of job and training performance” (Table 1). Participants in the survey were selected from individuals on the editorial board of the journal Intelligence, from all registered members of the International Society of Intelligence Researchers, and from persons who had published three or more articles in _Intelligence_ over the last 3 years (page 683). Experts were selected from this group by filtering down to “only individuals with a doctorate degree, and having at least five career publications on the topic of intelligence or testing” (page 683). This study was a replication of [Murphy, Cronin, and Tam (2003)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12940406/) [[doi](https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.4.660)], which found largely similar results.

[Rindermann, Becker, and Coyle (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289619301886) [[doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101406)] surveyed the opinions of over 100 experts in the field of intelligence about a variety of questions. One of the questions in the survey was “to what degree is the average socioeconomic status (SES) in Western societies determined by his or her IQ?” They survey found that “Experts believed 45% of SES variance was explained by intelligence and 55% by non-IQ factors (Table 3). 51% of experts believed that the contribution of intelligence (to SES) was below 50%, 38% above 50%, and 12% had a 50–50 opinion.” That is, experts believe that roughly half of the variance in socioeconomic status in Western societies is due to intelligence.

### High cognitive ability predicts success

In a recent review of intelligence research by experts in the field, [Nisbett et al. (2012)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191230083138/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf)] summarized the predictive power of IQ as follows (page 131):

> The measurement of intelligence is one of psychology’s greatest achievements and one of its most controversial. Critics complain that no single test can capture the complexity of human intelligence, all measurement is imperfect, no single measure is completely free from cultural bias, and there is the potential for misuse of scores on tests of intelligence. There is some merit to all these criticisms. But we would counter that the measurement of intelligence — which has been done primarily by IQ tests — has utilitarian value because it is a reasonably good predictor of grades at school, performance at work, and many other aspects of success in life (Gottfredson, 2004; Herrnstein & Murray, 1994). For example, students who score high on tests such as the SAT and the ACT, which correlate highly with IQ measures (Detterman & Daniel, 1989), tend to perform better in school than those who score lower (Coyle & Pillow, 2008). Similarly, people in professional careers, such as attorneys, accountants, and physicians, tend to have high IQs. Even within very narrowly defined jobs and on very narrowly defined tasks, those with higher IQs outperform those with lower IQs on average, with the effects of IQ being largest for those occupations and tasks that are most demanding of cognitive skills (F. L. Schmidt & Hunter, 1998, 2004).

A meta-analysis by [Strenze (2007)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200616015146/https://esferaarmilar.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf)] shows that intelligence (measured by IQ scores) is one of the best predictors of future socioeconomic success. The analysis concludes with the following (page 415):

> These results demonstrate that intelligence, when it is measured before most individuals have finished their schooling, is a powerful predictor of career success 12 or more years later when most individuals have already entered stable careers. Two of the correlations – with education and occupation – are of substantial magnitude according to the usual standards of social science.

Moderator analysis was performed to determine if the association between youth IQ and adulthood success was influenced by age at testing or age at measure success. Regarding age at testing, Strenze found that IQ measured as early as age 3-10 was found to predict adulthood outcomes (Table 2), although not as strongly as IQ measured at later ages. After age 10, age at testing did not seem to have much of an impact on the IQ-success association (Table 2). Regarding age at success, the association between youth IQ and education was fairly constant regardless of the age at success. However, the association between youth IQ and occupation/income was much lower when success was measured at ages 20-24. The association between youth IQ and occupation/income were largest when success was measured after age 29 (Table 2).

[Strenze (2015)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-strenze.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20201012134632/https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-strenze.pdf)] cites several meta-analyses showing the correlation between intelligence and a variety of measures of success (Table 25.1). The results showed large correlations between intelligence and academic performance in primary education (_r_=0.58), educational attainment (_r_=0.56), job performance (0.38-0.53, depending on the sample), occupational attainment (_r_=0.43), skill acquisition in work training (_r_=0.38), and several other metrics of success.

### Low cognitive ability predicts social dysfunction

Low IQs predict a wide range of negative social outcomes. For example, in an article of _Scientific American_, [Gottfredson (1998)](https://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1998generalintelligencefactor.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20201006071355/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1998generalintelligencefactor.pdf)] reports the following outcomes for non-Hispanic whites of various youth IQ scores:

-   Of those with IQs in the normal range (90-110), 6% live in poverty, 6% are High School dropouts, 8% of women are chronic welfare recipients, and 3% have been incarcerated
-   Of those with IQs between 75-90, 16% live in poverty, 35% are High School dropouts, 17% of women are chronic welfare recipients, and 7% of the men have been incarcerated
-   Of those with IQs below 75, 30% live in poverty, 55% are High School dropouts, 31% of women are chronic welfare recipients, and 7% of men have been incarcerated.

Low IQ scores predict a low likelihood of holding skilled and prestigious occupations. For example, [Hauser (2002)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2002-hauser.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191121230858/https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2002-hauser.pdf)] found:

-   Half of all janitors have an IQ just above 90 (Figure 12), slightly more than 25% have IQs above 100, and very few (slightly more than 5%) have IQs above 110.
-   The average electrical engineer has an IQ over 110, a small minority (<25%) have IQs below 100, and very few (<5%) have IQs below 90.

Generally speaking, the likelihood of a sub-90 person attaining an occupation that requires complex cognitive processing (e.g. doctors, engineers, professors, analysts, etc.) is very low. They are more likely to be found in unskilled or low-skilled labor (e.g. janitors, manual labor, etc.). [Gottfredson (1997)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200916184424/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf)] has also emphasized the scant occupational opportunities for low-IQ individuals (page 90):

> ...virtually all occupations accommodate individuals down to IQ 110, but virtually none routinely accommodates individuals below IQ 80 (WPT 10). Employment options drop dramatically with IQ-from virtually unlimited above IQ 120 to scant below IQ 80. Such options are virtually nonexistent today (except in sheltered settings) for individuals below IQ 70 to 75, the usual threshold for borderline mental retardation

Individuals with low IQs tend to be unable to complete all but the simplest of tasks. In fact, [10 U.S. Code § 520](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/520) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200423093414/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/520)] outlaws low-IQ individuals from participating in the Armed Forces. [Gottfredson (1997)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200916184424/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf)] cites evidence that these requirements are not arbitrary; the requirements are necessary to prevent the recruits from being overpopulated with expensive and untrainable members (page 90):

> Lest IQ 80 seem an unreasonably high (i.e., exclusionary) threshold in hiring, it should be noted that the military is prohibited by law (except under a declaration of war) from enlisting recruits below that level (the 10th percentile). That law was enacted because of the extraordinarily high training costs and high rates of failure among such men during the mobilization of forces in World War II (Laurence & Ramsberger, 1991; Sticht et al., 1987; U.S. Department of the Army, 1965). Minimum enlistment standards since World War II have generally been higher than the 10th percentile, and closer to what they are today for the different services: the 16th AFQT percentile (Army, about IQ 85), 21st (Marine Corps and Air Force, IQ 88), and 27th (Navy, IQ 91). It should be noted that these are the enlistment standards for high school graduates. Non-graduates must score above the 27th to 65th percentiles on the AFQT, depending on the service in question (Laurence & Ramsberger, 1991, p. 11).

### Cognitive ability predicts outcomes independently of plausible confounders

A meta-analysis by [Strenze (2007)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2007-strenze.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200616015146/https://esferaarmilar.pt/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Intelligence-and-socioeconomic-success-A-meta-analytic-review-of-longitudinal-research.pdf)] showed that the predictive power of IQ is slightly stronger than that of parental SES (Table 1). Specifically, IQ measured before age 19 outdoes parental SES in predicting future educational attainment, occupational prestige, and income (see "best studies"). In other words, if you want to predict an adolescent's success in adulthood along a given metric of success (e.g., income, educational attainment, or occupational prestige), it is more useful to know that adolescent's IQ than to know the success of their parents along that same metric. Strenze (page 416) argues that this would be unexpected if the predictive power of IQ could be attributed primarily to its association with parental SES:

> If the correlation between intelligence and success was a mere byproduct of the causal effect of parental SES or academic performance, then parental SES and academic performance should have outcompeted intelligence as predictors of success; but this was clearly not so. These results confirm that intelligence is an independent causal force among the determinants of success; in other words, the fact that intelligent people are successful is not completely explainable by the fact that intelligent people have wealthy parents and are doing better at school.

The meta-analysis does find that parental SES also correlates significantly with the future outcomes of the child. However, because youth IQ and parental SES are correlated, it is possible that _some_ unspecified portion of the predictive power of youth IQ is due to its correlation with parental SES (or vice-versa). To get a more precise estimate of the effects of youth IQ (independent of parental SES), we need to estimate the predictive power of IQ after controlling for parental SES.

[Murray and Herrnstein (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)] performed such an analysis with data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79). The NLSY79 was a longitudinal study that followed 12,686 who were aged 14 to 22 in 1979. Researchers recorded participants' IQ scores at the beginning of the study and performed several follow-ups to track their performance along various life outcomes. Murray and Herrnstein used the NLSY79 to compare the predictive power of youth IQ and parental SES on a number of measures of success. "Parental SES" is measured based on "information about the education, occupations, and income of the parents of NLSY youths" (page 131). Murray and Herrnstein found that youth IQ outperformed parental SES in predicting adulthood poverty, educational attainment, likelihood of having illegitimate children, welfare usage, crime, and offspring IQ. The general finding reported was that individuals with low IQs and average parental SES were often worse-off than those with average IQs and low parental SES, and (inversely) individuals with high IQs and average parental SES were better-off than those with average IQs and high parental SES (see chapters 5-12). For example, whites with IQs one standard deviation below the mean (85 IQ) and average parental SES were more than twice as likely to never complete High School as whites with average IQs (100 IQ) and parental SES one standard deviation below the mean (~25% vs ~10%, see page 149). If the predictive power of IQ was solely due to its correlation with parental SES, then we should not expect that IQ predicts outcomes better than parental SES.

The results of Murray and Herrnstein were partially corroborated by [Rindermann and Ceci (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0162353218799481) [[doi](https://doi.org/10.1177/0162353218799481)]. These authors performed an analysis of the same dataset used by Murray – the NLSY79 – to compare the predictive power of childhood intelligence compared to other factors such as parental education and parental wealth. Their results showed that "children’s cognitive ability is more important than parental income for children’s later income as adults" in the United States (page 21).

[Eid (2018)](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/36853967/dody_eid_ec_970.pdf?sequence=1) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200920085925/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/36853967/dody_eid_ec_970.pdf?sequence=1)] performed a similar analysis as Murray and Herrnstein using a newer data set: the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). The NLSY97 includes information on 8,984 individuals about most of the same variables as the NLSY79. The primary differences is, as one might expect from the name, that NLSY97 studies those who were in their youth in 1997 rather than 1979. Eid focused the analysis on investigating the relative predictive power of IQ versus parental SES on adulthood poverty. The results of the study corroborate the findings from Murray and Herrnstein on the relative predictive power of IQ and parental SES, although the predictive power of both are smaller (page 3):

> Without making any meaningful changes to HM's methodology, we reaffirm the hypothesis that IQ is more important than family SES in avoiding poverty, though both of these covariates' effects are smaller than those found by HM. Running a logistic regression with IQ, SES, and Age in 1997 as independent variables and poverty status in 2007 as the dependent variable, wefind the IQ effect to be approximately three times the size of the SES effect.

[Fergusson et al. (2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16033633/) [[doi](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01472.x)] examined a birth cohort of 1,265 children born in the Christchurch (New Zealand) urban region in mid-1977. Prior to controlling for other variables, researchers found that IQ measured at ages 8-9 was significantly related to outcomes such as crime, education, occupation, etc. at ages 15-25. For example, compared to individuals with childhood IQs below 85, individuals with childhood IQs above 115 were much more likely to gained school qualifications (98% vs 41%, Table 4), were much more likely to gain a university degree by age 25 (59% vs 2.1%, Table 4), and had higher mean incomes (37,433 vs 23,686). After controlling for a variety of covariates (e.g., childhood conduct problems, attentional problems, and socioeconomic disadvantage), researchers found that childhood IQ was still significantly associated with these outcomes, indicating that “intelligence had a direct relationship to later educational, occupational and related outcomes independently of other childhood characteristics and family environment” (page 856).

A meta-analysis by [Ttofihi et al. (2016)](https://www.criminologycyprus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ttofi16jcj.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20201029100848/https://www.criminologycyprus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ttofi16jcj.pdf)] investigated the extent to which intelligence may function as a protective factor against delinquency, violence, and crime. The authors investigated 15 longitudinal studies based in Europe (8), the United States (5) and New Zealand (2). The studies reported the impact of intelligence on the likelihood of offending among both high-risk and low-risk groups. “High-risk” groups includes individuals who were exposed to risk factors (other than low intelligence) for offending. These risk factors varied from study to study. Some risk factors included poor child rearing, teacher- and parent-ratings of antisocial behavior, low concentration, marital disturbance, imprisoned father, physical abuse, etc. (table 1). The authors found that, among the high-risk group, non-offenders were about 2.32 times as likely to have a high intelligence level as offenders (page 13). Some studies also investigated the effect of intelligence on offending among low-risk groups. For this group, non-offenders were only about 1.3 times as likely to have a high intelligence level, a non-significant result (page 12). The meta-analysis concludes that “intelligence can function as a protective factor for offending”. In other words, the impact of risk factors for offending is reduced among individuals of high intelligence; or, conversely, low intelligent individuals are particularly vulnerable to be negatively impacted by the risk factors for offending.

## Black-white differences in cognitive ability

----------

### Current cognitive ability gap

Research on race and IQ has fairly consistently shown that the average IQ score for blacks in the US is about one standard deviation (about 15 points) lower than the average IQ score for whites ([Neisser et al. 1996](http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200531161409/http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/IQ_Neisser2.pdf)], page 93). Studies often put the average black IQ at around 85 and the average white IQ at around 100 ([Gottfredson (1997)](http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200922120858/http://www.intelligence.martinsewell.com/Gottfredson1997.pdf)], page 14). IQ scores are normally distributed for both racial groups. One standard deviation may not seem like much, but these differences have the following profound implications:

-   Only 16% of blacks have an IQ above 100, compared to 50% of whites.
-   Only 3% of blacks have IQs above 115, compared to 16% of whites (115 IQ = the average for many professional and technical positions, and some selective colleges).
-   65% of blacks have an IQ below 90, compared to 25% of whites.
-   35% of blacks have an IQ below 80, compared to less than 10% of whites (these individuals are below the cutoff point for acceptance into the US armed forces).
-   16% of blacks have an IQ below 70, compared to 3% of whites (this constitutes intellectual disability according to the [DSM-5](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605084933/https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf)]).

It should be noted that there is some controversy regarding the current IQ gap. [Nisbett (2005)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Nisbett-commentary-on-30years.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200406163200/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Nisbett-commentary-on-30years.pdf)] (page 302) uses the following data to argue that the present BW IQ gap is smaller than 15 points:

> We do not have actual IQ scores available to establish this point but rather various ability tests, most of which are highly correlated with IQ—some as high as .8 to .9. Though IQ scores would be preferable to speak directly to the question of IQ change, such data are unavailable in the form of a national random sample. In contrast, several probability samples of U.S. elementary and high school students are available. These include, over the period 1965–1994, the Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) survey, the National Longitudinal Study, the High School and Beyond survey, the National Education Longitudinal Study, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress program (NAEP)

Nisbett uses scores on these ability tests to conclude "The gap is substantially less than that [one standard deviation] at the present time, probably more like 0.6–0.7 standard deviation or approximately 10 IQ points" (page 302). [Dickens and Flynn (2006)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.915.9087&rep=rep1&type=pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200806132548/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.915.9087&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] also argued that the IQ gap reduced between 1972 and 2002. They argue that, in 2002, the black IQ was 95.5 points at age 4 but was 84.5 points at age 23 (page 916). Not everyone agrees that the IQ gap has reduced in recent years. For example, [Gottfredson (2005)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.174.783&rep=rep1&type=pdf) has argued that the narrowing of the achievement gap does not imply a narrowing of the IQ gap (page 313). A meta-analysis by [Roth et al. (2001)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-01339-002) suggests that the gap is still about one standard deviation (15 IQ points). In fact, [Rushton and Jensen (2006)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.843.2060&rep=rep1&type=pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200817172557/https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.843.2060&rep=rep1&type=pdf)] have heavily criticized the findings by Dickens and Flynn. [Rushton and Jensen (2005)](http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200607132056/http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf)] have argued that "the mean Black–White group difference in IQ has not changed significantly over the past 100 years" (page 274) and have even suggested that the average IQ for black Americans may be around 70 points "for Black Americans in certain areas of the Deep South of the United States where the degree of White admixture is significantly below the general average" (page 260). Clearly, experts disagree on the current magnitude of the gap. Since one standard deviation seems to be the standardly accepted magnitude, I will assume that the gap is 15 points for my post.

### Impact of group differences in cognitive ability

See [Gottfredson (2004)](https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/articles/Gottfredson%202004socialconsequences.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301094755/https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/645/articles/Gottfredson%202004socialconsequences.pdf)] goes into more detail on the impact of racial differences in IQ by considering the life outcomes associated with a variety of different IQ thresholds:

-   An IQ of 75 "signals the ability level below which individuals are not likely to master the elementary school curriculum or function independently in adulthood in modern societies" (page 28). They are likely to be eligible "financial support provided to mentally and physically disabled adults" by the U.S. government. Such individuals are "difficult to train except for the simplest tasks, so they are fortunate in industrialized nations to get any paying job at all. While only 1 out of 50 Asian-Americans faces such risk, Figure 3 shows that 1 out of 6 black Americans does."
-   An IQ of 85 is another threshold considered because "the U.S. military sets its minimum enlistment standards at about this level" (page 28). The military is often viewed as a last resort by many people, but "this minimum standard rules out almost half of blacks (44%) and a third of Hispanics (34%), but far fewer whites (13%) and Asians (8%)." Individuals with IQs in this range "live at the edge of unemployability in modern nations, and the jobs they do get are typically the least prestigious and lowest paying: for example, janitor, food service worker, hospital orderly, or parts assembler in a factory."
-   An IQ of 105 can be viewed as "the minimum threshold for achieving moderately high levels of success" (page 30). People above this level are "highly competitive for middle-level jobs (clerical, crafts and repair, sales, police and firefighting), and they are good contenders for the lower tiers of managerial and professional work (supervisory, technical, accounting, nursing, teaching)." The percentages of people achieving this threshold of IQ are "53%, 40%, 27%, and 8%, respectively, for Asians, whites, Hispanics, and blacks."

Obviously these large racial differences in cognitive ability will cause many racial differences in important social outcomes. However, this data actually understates the importance of the racial differences in IQ. This is because the vast majority of black people tend to live in populations with high concentrations of black people. Therefore, black individuals are disadvantaged not only because they tend to have lower IQs, but also because they tend to live in environments composed mostly of low IQ people. This means that they tend to live in areas with, e.g., high levels of crime, few occupational opportunities, little economic opportunity, high levels of social disorganization, etc. These macro-level disadvantages impose harms on their lives above and beyond the harms of their individual IQ. Gottfredson also mentions the community-level challenges that are above and beyond the individual-level harms (page 31):

> Where races tend to form separate communities, these disparities in individual-level outcomes create additional challenges at the community-level. Consider, for example, the percentages of each racial-ethnic group that score above IQ 110 vs. below IQ 90. For Asians it is 40% vs. 14%, for a ratio of almost 3:1. That is, there are 3 Asians who are at least somewhat above average in intelligence for every 1 who is at least somewhat below average. The pattern is starkly different for blacks: there is only 1 black who is at least somewhat above average in IQ for every 12 who are at least somewhat below average (59%). The percentages are 28% vs. 22% for whites, and 10% vs. 41% for Hispanics.

It should be clear that such large racial differences in cognitive ability are responsible for at least some of the social disparities that we find between blacks and whites today. In the rest of this post, I give examples of social disparities that are eliminated (or at least significantly reduced) after controlling for cognitive ability.

### Many racial economic disparities reduce after controlling for cognitive ability

Many of the economic disparities between blacks and whites are mostly eliminated after controlling for cognitive ability. Consider the following studies that examine wage gaps and income mobility gaps between blacks and whites after controlling for adolescent scores on the The Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). The AFQT correlates highly (r=0.8) with other conventional IQ tests such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) ([source](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webG1471.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320150303/https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/MG265/images/webG1471.pdf)]) and is often used as a measure of IQ in many studies.

[Johnson and Neal (1998)](http://www.people.virginia.edu/~wrj8y/finaljencks.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20181221010750/http://www.people.virginia.edu/~wrj8y/finaljencks.pdf)] found that controlling for age and teenage AFQT scores eliminates about two-thirds of the wage gap for young men and all of the gap for young women. The wage gap reduces from 24% to 9% for men after controlling for AFQT. For young women, black women go from a 17% disadvantage to a 5% _advantage_ after controlling for AFQT scores (page 4). Assuming black men and black women represent roughly equal shares of the black labor force, controlling for AFQT scores reduces the wage gap from about 21.5% to 2% (averaging the figures above), accounting for about 90% of the wage gap. Also, see [Neal and Johnson (1996)](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~gwallace/Papers/Neal%20and%20Johnson%20(1996).pdf) for an alternative article reporting on the same experiment.

In the introductory chapter of _The Black-White Test Score Gap,_ [Jencks and Phillips (1998)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200428215546/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)] (page 6) report that, after controlling for age and controlling for those who scored above the 50th percentile on the AFQT when they were 18 to 23 years old, the wages of the average black male aged 31 to 36 was about 96% of the wages of the average white male of the same age. Thus, the wage gap is virtually eliminated without even controlling for geography, education, parental socioeconomic status, or even occupation. [O'Neill (1990)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4726239_The_Role_of_Human_Capital_in_Earnings_Differences_Between_Black_and_White_Men) finds similar results.

A report by [Mazumder (2008)](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/empreportsupward20intergen20mobility2008530pdf.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200516151458/https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/pcs_assets/2012/EMPReportsUpward20Intergen20Mobility2008530pdf.pdf)] published by _Pew Charitable Trusts_ showed that about 75% of whites born into the bottom quintile of income transition out of that quintile, whereas only about 56% of blacks do the same (figures 3a and 3b). However, among those with a median AFQT score, there is almost no difference in the likelihood of transitioning out of the bottom quintile - 81% for whites and 78% for blacks (page 30). The data suggests that "test scores can explain virtually the entire black-white mobility gap" (page 30). Similar data was reported in [Bhattacharya and Mazumder (2011)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3982/QE69), [Mazumder (2012)](https://hceconomics.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/file_uploads/Mazumder_Black_White_Mobility_3_28_12.pdf), [Mazumder (2014)](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/frbchi/economicperspectives/frbchi_econper_2014q1.pdf), and [Davis and Mazumder (2018)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3138979). For example, Mazumder (2014) reports that the proportion of whites who move out of the bottom quintile is 27 percentage points higher than blacks who do the same. However, for those with median AFQT scores at adolescence, the gap reduces from 27 percentage points to just 5.2 percentage points, which suggests that "cognitive skills measured at adolescence can account for much of the black–white difference in upward mobility" (page 12).

### Other racial disparities in social outcomes reduce after controlling for cognitive ability

[Nyborg and Jensen (2001)](http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Occupation-and-Income-Related-to-Psychometric-g-2001-by-Helmuth-S%C3%B8rensen-Nyborg-Arthur-Robert-Jensen.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200915145341/http://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Occupation-and-Income-Related-to-Psychometric-g-2001-by-Helmuth-S%C3%B8rensen-Nyborg-Arthur-Robert-Jensen.pdf)] examined income and occupational status among large samples of white and black American armed forces veterans in their late 30s. The data set contained 4,462 males obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The unconditional gaps in income and occupational index were 0.48 and 0.28 standard deviations, respectively (Table 2). After controlling for _g_ scores, the disparities were eliminated. In fact, blacks actually outperformed whites in these outcomes after controlling for _g_. For example, among individuals above the 50th percentile in _g_, blacks had higher incomes than whites (Figure 1). More impressively, blacks had higher occupational statuses than whites at every _g_ factor score (Figure 2).

[Cameron and Heckman (2001)](https://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/media/_media/pdf/Reference%20Media/Cameron%20and%20Heckman_2001_Race%20and%20Ethnicity.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20210103093337/https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w7249/w7249.pdf)] used data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to examine racial differences in educational attainment. The researchers examine four measures of educational attainment: the probability of being in grade 9 or higher at age 15, the probability of high school completion at age 24, the probability of college entry at age 24 conditional on high school graduation, and the probability of college entry at age 24 unconditional on high school graduation. Without controlling for family income, family background factors, or AFQT scores, black children lag behind white children on each of these measures. However, if one were to control for AFQT scores, this would improve black outcomes on each of these measures enough to _reverse_ the disparities between blacks and whites (Table 4). For example, researchers note that "Regardless of income and family background, at the same AFQT level, blacks and Hispanics enter college at rates that are substantially higher than the white rate. The predictions for high school completion are similarly dramatic" (page 486).

[Murray and Herrnstein (1994)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200609204951/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)] used data from the NLSY79 to show that youth IQ explains black-white disparities in a wide variety of social outcomes. In fact, many substantial gaps in important social outcomes completely disappeared or even reversed after controlling for IQ:

-   90% of the wage gap is erased when controlling for IQ. Controlling only for age, the mean black worker's wages are 80% of the mean white worker's wages. After controlling for only age and IQ, the number jumps to 98%. For comparison, controlling for age, education, and parental SES (but not IQ), brings the number up to only 86% (page 324).
-   The gap in high-IQ occupations _reverses_ when we fix to persons with an IQ of 117 (the average IQ of workers in these occupations). About 3% of blacks are in high-IQ occupations compared to 5% of whites. Among persons with an IQ of 117, 10% of whites had a high-IQ occupation compared to 26% of blacks (page 322). "High-IQ" occupations include lawyers, physicians, dentists, engineers, college teachers, accountants, architects, chemists, computer scientists, mathematicians, natural scientists, and social scientists.
-   The High School graduation gap _reverses_ when we fix to persons with an IQ of 103 (the average IQ of High School graduates). 73% of blacks in the NLSY had graduated High School compared to 84% of whites. Among persons with an IQ of 103, the number rises to 93% for blacks and 89% for whites (page 319).
-   The gap in bachelor degree attainment _reverses_ when we fix to persons with an IQ of 114 (the average IQ of college graduates). Among 29-year-olds, blacks had much lower rates of bachelor degree attainment than whites (11% vs 27%). However, among 29-year-olds with an IQ of 114, blacks have much higher rates of bachelor degree attainment (60% vs 50%, page 320). Among 29-year-olds with an IQ of 100, blacks had much higher rates of bachelor degree attainment (25.4% vs 11.9%, table 3 of Appendix 6). In contrast, among 29-year-olds with average parental SES, blacks had slightly lower rates of bachelor degree attainment (15.9% vs 16.2%, table 3 of Appendix 6).

So black-white disparities in income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment are almost entirely eliminated after controlling for IQ (at least 90% of the gap is eliminated). In most cases, the disparities are _reversed_ when controlling for IQ. Here are some other disparities that are significantly eliminated after controlling for IQ:

-   74% of the disparity in poverty rates among adults is erased when we fix to persons of average IQ (IQ=100). Among 29-year-olds, 26% of blacks were in poverty compared to 7% of whites. Among 29-year-olds with average IQ, the number drops to 11% for blacks and 6% for whites (page 326).
-   83% of the gap in childhood poverty rates is erased when we fix to mothers with average IQ (IQ=100). Among 29-year-old mothers, the probability of their children living in poverty within the first three years of age was 54% for blacks and 9% for whites. Among 29-year-old mothers with average IQ, the number drops to 14% for blacks and 6% for whites (page 335).
-   73% of the disparity in incarceration is erased when we fix to persons with average IQ (IQ=100). Among 29-year-olds, 13% of blacks had ever been interviewed in a correctional facility (a proxy for incarceration) compared to 2% of whites. Among 29-year-olds with average IQ, the number drops to 5% for blacks and 2% for whites (page 338).

So there are still some considerable residual gaps in poverty and crime after controlling for IQ. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the gaps are eliminated after controlling for IQ. Some disparities, however, were not impacted as much after controlling for IQ:

-   Only 20% of the disparity in illegitimacy rates is erased when fixing to persons of average IQ. For 29-year-old mothers, the probability of having a child out of wedlock was 62% for blacks and 12% for whites. For persons of average IQ, the number dropped to 51% for blacks and 10% for whites (page 331).
-   Only half of the disparity in welfare usage is erased when fixing to persons of average IQ. For 29-year-old women, the probability of having been on welfare was 49% for blacks and 13% for whites. For persons of average IQ, the number dropped to 30% for blacks and 12% for whites (page 332).
-   The disparity in marital rates is almost unaffected when fixing to persons of average IQ. For persons over the age of 30, the probability of being married by age 30 is 54% for blacks and 78% for whites. For persons of average IQ, the number rises to 58% for blacks and 79% for whites (page 329).

So while IQ disparities explain almost the entirety of the gaps in income, occupational prestige, and education, they do not explain much of the disparity in illegitimacy rates, marital rates, and welfare usage. Likely, these latter disparities are the result of cultural differences regarding marriage. These cultural differences probably also explain much of the residual gap in poverty after controlling for IQ (since married households are substantially less likely to be poor). Furthermore, IQ significantly outdoes parental SES in accounting for disparities in many social outcomes, including high school dropout rates, bachelor degree attainment, poverty rates, attainment of a "high-IQ" occupation, etc. (see Table 3 of appendix 6).

## Conclusion

----------

Most people are aware of the large social disparities between blacks and whites, such as the racial disparities in income, education, occupation, and crime. Further, most people take these disparities to be seriously important. That is, most people believe we as a society have a moral imperative to reduce these disparities as much as possible. If the arguments that I have made in this post are sound, the cognitive ability gap is responsible for many of these social disparities. Therefore, assuming that we have a moral imperative to reduce the aforementioned social disparities, we have very strong reason to investigate racial differences in cognitive ability. In a recent review of intelligence research by experts in the field, [Nisbett et al. (2012)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191230083138/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf)] have expressed this same point (page 131):

> IQ is also important because some group differences are large and predictive of performance in many domains. Much evidence indicates that it would be difficult to overcome racial disadvantage if IQ differences could not be ameliorated. IQ tests help us to track the changes in intelligence of different groups and of entire nations and to measure the impact of interventions intended to improve intelligence.

If we have a moral imperative to reduce racial inequalities as much as possible (as most people seem to agree), then we also have a moral imperative to reduce black-white differences in cognitive ability as much as possible (since the latter is necessary to achieve the former). [Jencks and Phillips (1998)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf) [[archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230083624/https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf)] advanced the same argument (page 3):

> In a country as racially polarized as the United States, no single change taken in isolation could possibly eliminate the entire legacy of slavery and Jim Crow or usher in an era of full racial equality. But if racial equality is America’s goal, reducing the black-white test score gap would probably do more to promote this goal than any other strategy that commands broad political support. Reducing the test score gap is probably both necessary and sufficient for substantially reducing racial inequality in educational attainment and earnings. Changes in education and earnings would in turn help reduce racial differences in crime, health, and family structure, although we do not know how large these effects would be.

To _solve_ a problem, we should understand the _cause_ of the problem. Therefore, assuming that most people are correct that we have a moral imperative to minimize racial inequalities, we should work to understand the _cause_ of the black-white cognitive ability gap. I attempt to start this investigation in [a later post](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/poor-explanations-of-the-black-white-iq-gap/).
