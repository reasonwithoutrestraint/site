title: "The magnitude and scope of black criminality"
---

The purpose of this post is to cite the extent of black criminality around the world. The first section is concerned with black criminality in the United States. This section should not be terribly surprising to most people since I assume (hope) most people are aware that blacks people are disproportionately engaged in criminality in the United States. I believe the latter two sections contain information that most people are not aware of. The second section covers misconduct among black _children_ in the United States. The third and final section covers black criminality and misconduct outside of the United States. The last two sections, especially the last section, will probably be educational for the vast majority of people reading this post. If not, the post at the very least serves as a useful fact sheet for those interested in this topic.

## Black criminality in the United States

----------

### Imprisonment

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has recently published a report [“Prisoners in 2018”](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603213541/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p18.pdf)] which shows that prisons are disproportionately composed of black prisoners:

-   Despite being only 13% of the general population, blacks comprise 32% of the prison population (410k out of 1.3M, see Table 14).
-   The imprisonment rate for black adults is over 5 times the rate for non-Hispanic white adults (see Table 6).
-   The imprisonment rate for black 20-24 year-olds is 8 times the rate for their non-Hispanic white counterparts (Figure 2).
-   The imprisonment rate for black 18-19 year-olds is over 12 times the rate for their non-Hispanic white counterparts (Figure 2).
-   There are 75,700 blacks imprisoned for homicide (69,500 in state prisons, table 14; 6,200 in federal prisons, table 16) whereas there are only 45,200 non-Hispanic whites imprisoned for homicide (42,100 in state prisons, table 14; 3,100 in federal prisons, table 16). Thus, there are about 1.4 times as many blacks imprisoned for homicide as there are whites (74,700 vs 45,200). Since there about 4.6 times as many non-Hispanic whites as there are blacks (60% vs 13% of the population according to the [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200614011900/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218)]), this suggests that blacks are about 6.4 times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to be incarcerated for homicide.

Many people believe that black disproportionate incarceration is largely the result of drug-related offenses. The data shows that this is not the case. The BJS report cited earlier shows that the vast majority of imprisoned blacks are not imprisoned due to drug-related offenses:

-   The vast majority of black _state_ prisoners are not imprisoned for drug-related crimes. The majority (61%) are imprisoned for violent crimes. Only 13% of black prisoners are imprisoned for drug-related offenses (including e.g. trafficking), and only 3.2% are imprisoned for drug possession. For comparison, 4.5% of white prisoners are imprisoned for drug possession (Table 13). Note that state prisons contain the vast majority (88%) of all prisoners (page 3).
-   About half (45%) of black federal prisoners are imprisoned for drug-related crimes (Table 15) (federal prisoners constitute only 12% of all prisoners). But almost none of them were imprisoned for drug possession; 99% of federal drug offenders were sentenced for trafficking (see note g of Table 15).

### Arrests

Someone might object by saying that this data merely reports black _imprisonment_ rather than black _crime_. This objection can be dismissed by using [arrest statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200605235303/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43)] published by the FBI. The data shows that black people are arrested for a disproportionate amount of crime in the United States:

-   Blacks commit 37% of violent crime (despite being 13% of the general population).
-   Blacks commit 53% of murders and 54% of robberies.
-   Among criminals under the age of 18, blacks commit over 58% of murders, 64% of robberies, and over 48% of violent crime.
-   Blacks commit 20% more homicides than whites (including Hispanic whites) (4,778 vs 3,953). Since there are about 6 times as many whites as there are blacks (70% vs 13% of the population according to the [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200614011900/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI225218)]), this implies that the black homicide rate is 6-7 times the white homicide rate. If we had data to compare the black homicide rate to the _non-Hispanic_ homicide rate, the disparity would be even larger. For example, [Harris (2009)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111266/) reported that, in Pennsylvania, the black homicide arrest rate was over _20 times_ the non-Hispanic white rate in Pennsylvania (Table 1). The result is that, if every racial group constituted an equal share of the population, blacks would constitute 67% of arrests for homicides, Hispanics 30%, and non-Hispanic whites only 3% (Table 1).

To illustrate just how stark these disparities are, compare _racial_ disparities in homicide to _sex_ disparities in homicide using [data](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200721071324/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf)] published by the FBI. Among people aged 18-24 in 2005, the homicide offending rate for black males (203.3 per 100k pop) was about _9_ times the rate for white males (22.4 per 100k pop) (page 79). For comparison, the homicide offending rate for white males of this age was about _11_ times the rate for white females (2.0 per 100k) of the sage age. In other words, among 18-24 year olds, the magnitude of the homicide offending disparity between black and white males is comparable to the magnitude of the same disparity between male and female whites. Note, again, that these statistics include Hispanic whites under the white category; the racial disparity would be even larger if we compared blacks to non-Hispanic whites specifically.

Another point worth mentioning is that racial arrest statistics mostly mirror racial incarceration statistics. [Beck and Blumstein (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-017-9357-6) analyzed FBI data on arrest suspects and BJC data on prisoners to estimate the degree to which disproportionate _incarceration_ of black was the result of disproportionate _arrests_ of black people. More specifically, the goal was to estimate the percentage of the black-white incarceration disparity that can be explained by the black-white arrest disparity. The researchers found that "approximately 70 to 75% of the racial disproportionality among state prisoners is accounted for by black-white differences in arrests" (page 11). In other words, the vast majority of black overrepresentation in prisons is the result of black overrepresentation in arrests, although the researchers do find that prison racial disparities are less accounted for by arrests for certain crimes (e.g., drug crimes) and certain regions (northeast). The researchers note that possible factors causing the unexplained 25-30% may be racial differences in criminal history, racial differences in the ability of defendants to hire effective counsel, and possibly bias by prosecutors, judges, etc. (page 11). A similar earlier analysis by [Tonry and Melewski (2008)](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=faculty_articles) posited that unexplained residual is primarily due to sentencing laws and policies that "specify punishments that are both absolutely and relatively severe for violent, drug, and gun crimes for which blacks are more likely than whites to be arrested and prosecuted" (page 31).

### Victimizations

Someone might object by saying that the FBI data merely reports black _arrests_ rather than black _crime_. The idea is that police may be more likely to _arrest_ black people even though black people are no more likely to _commit_ crimes. This objection can be dismissed by reviewing data on crime _victimizations_ rather than _commissions_.

One source of data for crime victimizations is the BJS’s [National Crime Victimization Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Victimization_Survey) (NCVS), which is a survey that interviews individuals who were victims of crime. Data is limited to violent crimes of rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. [Beck and Blumstein (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-017-9357-6) performed an analysis of NCVS data among victims who identified the race of their assailant. They found that the share of assailants perceived to be black closely mirrored the share of arrestees that were black. Specifically, the ratio of the percent black among arrestees to the percent black among offenders for the aforementioned violent crimes was 0.97 (page 23), suggesting that the percent black among arrestees is nearly identical to the percent black among assailants.

For _homicide_ victimization data, we have to use other sources. Because homicide victims are dead, we cannot rely on their perceptions to determine the race of the assailant. Instead, we can look at the race of the _victims_ of homicide. This should give us information on the race of assailants because the vast majority of violent crime is _inter_racial rather than _intra_racial. For example, according to [data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200530095126/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls)] from the FBI, the vast majority (88%) of homicides _against_ black victims are committed _by_ black offenders. Therefore, rates of homicide _victimizations_ of blacks should reflect rates of homicide _offenses_ by blacks_._

There are a [two main sources](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200730233359/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf)] of data to measure homicide victimization rates by race – the FBI and the CDC. Firstly, according to [data](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200721071324/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf)] published by the FBI, blacks are disproportionately victims of homicides to a similar magnitude that they are disproportionately arrested for homicide. Specifically, despite making up just 12-13% of the population between 1976 and 2005, blacks constituted 47% of homicide victims, which is roughly to be expected given that blacks also constituted 52% of homicide offenders (page 12). Secondly, [the CDC (2018)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200515175641/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_06.pdf)] reports the leading cause of death for people broken out by race and age. The results show a homicide epidemic among young black males:

-   Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15-19, aged 20-24, and aged 25-35 (see page 34).
-   Homicide is the cause of _most_ deaths (50.8%) of black males aged 15-19 and nearly _half_ (49.6%) of deaths of black males aged 20-24 (see page 34). For comparison, homicide was the cause of only 3-5% of the deaths of non-Hispanic white males of this age (see page 27).
-   The homicide death rate for black males aged 20-24 (110.8 deaths per 100,000 population; page 34) is over _20 times_ the rate for similarly aged non-Hispanic white males (5.4 deaths per 100,000 population; page 27). If anything, this suggests that the FBI arrest data may _under-estimate_ the black homicide rate.

### Murder exonerations

The racial disparity in _deaths_ due to homicides should be sufficient to demonstrate a racial disparity in _commission_ of homicides. For further proof, we can consider exonerations for murder - cases in which a person was wrongly convicted of murder and later cleared of charges based on new evidence of innocence. This can help inform the degree to which murder convictions reflect murder commissions. If we look at [murder exonerations by race](https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/ExonerationsRaceByCrime.aspx), we find that blacks do not seem to be any more likely to be exonerated than, say, whites. The link shows that blacks constitute 551/1060 of people exonerated for homicide (as of August 3rd, 2020). So black people account for 52% of those who are exonerated for homicide. This is essentially equal to the percentage of black people who are arrested for homicide. This suggests that wrongful convictions do not play a significant role in explaining racial disparities in arrests/convictions for homicide.

### The most murderous U.S. cities

The racial disparities in crime are so great that cities with the largest percentage of black people tend to be the most dangerous cities. Conversely, the most dangerous cities tend to be the cities with the largest percentage of black people.

For example, consider the [ten cities](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-06.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20201215181800/https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-06.pdf)] (Table 7) with the highest percentage of black people among cities with populations over 100,000 in 2010:

136,286

Homicide rates were calculated by using the 2018 FBI homicide data published [here](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/) to determine the number of homicides per 100,000 population. Each of these cities have considerably high homicide rates. To see this, consider the following points:

-   [Data](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/murder) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20201215112801/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/murder)] from the FBI indicates that the homicide rate for the entire country is 5 homicides per 100,000 population (see Overview section). The homicide rate for whites is around 3 homicides per 100,000 population, and the homicide rate for blacks is around 20 homicides per 100,000.
-   Consider the major cities (population over 250k). The major cities from the above list are Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, and New Orleans. As of [2019](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200622121134/https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/)], these cities were 4 of the 5 most homicidal major cities in the country. The other city in the top 5 was St. Louis, Missouri, which has a black plurality of 47%.
-   Now consider mid-sized cities (population over 100k and under 250k). The mid-sized cities from the above list are Jackson, Miami Gardens, Birmingham, Flint, Montgomery, and Savannah. As of [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_(100,000%E2%80%93250,000)) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191003184701/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_(100,000%E2%80%93250,000))], these 6 cities were the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th and 37th most homicidal mid-sized cities.

Now consider the 10 [major cities](https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200622121134/https://www.thetrace.org/2018/04/highest-murder-rates-us-cities-list/)] (population over 250k) with the highest homicide rates in the country. Using demographic data from [here](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/philadelphiacitypennsylvania,clevelandcityohio,washingtoncitydistrictofcolumbia,newarkcitynewjersey,kansascitycitymissouri,US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200623005408/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/philadelphiacitypennsylvania,clevelandcityohio,washingtoncitydistrictofcolumbia,newarkcitynewjersey,kansascitycitymissouri,US/RHI225218)] and [here](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/memphiscitytennessee,neworleanscitylouisiana,detroitcitymichigan,baltimorecitymaryland,stlouiscitymissouri,US/RHI225218) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200623005541/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/memphiscitytennessee,neworleanscitylouisiana,detroitcitymichigan,baltimorecitymaryland,stlouiscitymissouri,US/RHI225218)], one finds that these cities are disproportionately black to a significant degree:

-   4 of the 10 most murderous cities have black majorities (Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, and Memphis).
-   5 of the 10 most murderous cities have black pluralities and are at least 40% black (St. Louis, Newark, Washington D.C., Cleveland, and Philadelphia).
-   The only city in the top 10 that did not have a black plurality was Kansas City, which had a relatively high black population of 29%.
-   Keep in mind that only 13% of the United States population is black, and majority-black major cities are rather rare. In [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._communities_with_African-American_majority_populations_in_2000), there were less than 20 cities with populations over 100k that were majority black.

### Black criminality is ubiquitous

The extreme levels of black criminality are not isolated to particular cities or regions of the country. Rampant black criminality is found in every area of the country. A [2019 study](https://vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide19.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200116091603/http://vpc.org/studies/blackhomicide19.pdf)] by the Violence Policy Center analyzed homicides during 2016 and reported that the black homicide rate was extremely high in _every_ state in the country. The study reports that the black homicide rate was 20.44 per 100,000, whereas the national homicide rate was 5.10 per 100,000 and the white homicide rate was 2.96 per 100,000. The black homicide rate in _every_ state with more than 10 black homicide victims was over 3 times the _average_ white homicide rate (see Appendix two: Connecticut had a homicide rate of 9.27 per 100,000, which was the lowest black homicide rate of all states with more than 10 black homicide victims).

Furthermore, the extreme levels of black criminality are not limited to particular types of homicide. The FBI released [data](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200721071324/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf)] showing the percentage of homicide offenders by race broken out by circumstance (page 62). The circumstances were "workplace", "argument", "gang related", "drug related", "sex related", and "felony murder". Black people were disproportionately associated with homicide offending for every circumstance. The data also showed the percentage of homicide offenders by race broken out by victim/offender relationship. The relationships were "intimate", "family", "infanticide", and "eldercide". Again, black people were disproportionately associated with homicide offending for every victim/offender relationship.

In summary, blacks have disproportionate rates of imprisonment, arrests, deaths due to homicides, and crime. The racial disparity in crime is particularly striking for the most serious crimes, such as violent crimes and homicides.

## Misconduct among black youth

----------

Black children display disproportionate levels of misconduct very early:

-   A [2010 report](https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/d6_legacy_files/downloads/publication/Suspended_Education.pdf)] by the Southern Poverty Law Center on urban middle schoolers showed that black males are nearly 3 times as likely as white males to be suspended (28.3% vs 10%) [Figure 2]. Black females are over 4 times as likely as white females to be suspended (18% vs 4%) [Figure 2].
-   A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on discipline disparities shows that the racial disparity in suspension rate is not accounted for by controlling for level of school poverty. At every level of school poverty, black students are significantly more likely to be suspended than any other race of students. In fact, the out-of-school suspension rate for black students attending schools with the lowest level of poverty (7.5%) is _higher_ than the rate for white students attending schools with the highest level of poverty (7.3%) [Table 14].

This misconduct appears even at _preschool_:

-   A [2014 report](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-early-learning-snapshot.pdf)] by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights shows that “Black students represent 18% of preschool enrollment, but 42% of preschool students suspended once, and 48% of students suspended more than once.”
-   A [2016 article](https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-na-suspension-rates-preschool-crdc-20160606-snap-story.html)] by the LA Times reported that “although black girls represent 20% of preschool enrollment, 54% of preschool girls suspended once or more were black.”
-   A [2018 report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200603064643/https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/690828.pdf)] by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on discipline disparities shows black preschoolers are over 3 times as likely as white preschoolers to be suspended (1.1% vs 0.3%) [Table 17].

Now, some people might accept these facts but deny that it demonstrates early _misconduct_ by black children. One might argue that this demonstrates only that black children are disproportionately _punished_ for _alleged_ misconduct, but it doesn’t show that they disproportionately _engage_ in misconduct. Such a person might argue that teachers and principals around the country have an anti-black bias when deciding who to punish for alleged misconduct. To this argument, I have a few responses:

-   While black teachers suspend black children at lower rates than white teachers do, they still suspend black children at a rate several times that of white children. For example, white male teachers suspend black male students at 3 times the rate of white male students (15.4% vs 5.2%), and black male teachers suspend black male students at 2.4 times the rate of white male students (12.7% vs 5.3%) [source: see [Figure 2](https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)] [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.educationnext.org/teacher-race-and-school-discipline-suspensions-research/)]. So if racial differences in suspension rates are due to an anti-black bias, it looks like the same bias is found among black teachers. While this is certainly possible, it is less plausible.
-   A [2014 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235214000105)] published in the _Journal of Criminal Justice_ found that prior problem behavior accounts for the racial disparity in school suspensions: “Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student – a finding never before reported in the literature.” The study concludes, “these findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued.” This finding is completely unexpected if we assume teachers had a strong anti-black bias. After all, if a teacher had an anti-black bias, why would she treat black and white students identically if they had comparable histories? Does her anti-black bias magically disappear when she’s considering blacks and whites with the same history? No, the best explanation is that black students are suspended more because they are more likely to misbehave.
-   According to a [report](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200904074024/https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d18/tables/dt18_220.56.asp)] by the National Center for Education Statistics, black kindergartners are significantly more likely to report having been physically assaulted by other students. In particular, in 2010, the percentage of first-time black kindergartners who report having been "pushed, shoved, slapped, hit, or kicked other students" (7.9%) is over 6 times greater than the percentage of first-time white kindergartners who report the same (1.2%).

None of this data should be surprising given the statistics cited in the first section. Adult criminals tend to exhibit misbehavior in early childhood. People who engage in criminal activity usually display problematic signs very early in life.

## Black criminality around the world

----------

There are similar relative levels of black criminality in other countries.

### United Kingdom

According to [data from the U.K. Ministry of Justice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf)], black people are disproportionately imprisoned and arrested in England and Wales:

-   Blacks account for 14.2% of arrests despite accounting for just 3.1% of the population [Table A].
-   Black people are arrested at 3 times the rate for white people (66.9 vs 22.8 per 1,000 population) [Table 3.12].
-   Black people represented 13.1% of the prison population [Table 5.03] despite representing 3.1% of the general population [Table A].

The disproportionate rate of black imprisonment and arrests is the result of disproportionate black criminality:

-   [Crime statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200606012412/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019)] by the U.K. government show for the three-year period year ending March 2017 to the year ending March 2019, blacks accounted for 18% of principal suspects for homicide. This is despite the fact that they account for just 3.3% of the general population (figure 1 from the [United Kingdom Census 2011](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200613151047/https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest)]). For reference, whites account for 86% of the population and commit 70% of murders. This implies that the black murder rate is over 6 times the white murder rate, a similar pattern that is found in the United States.
-   A [2018 article](https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://news.sky.com/story/black-murder-victims-and-suspects-london-v-uk-11443656)] by _News Sky_ revealed that despite being just 13% of London’s population, blacks accounted for 48% of London murder suspects. These numbers are _strikingly_ similar to the corresponding numbers in the United States population where, despite being only 13% of the general population, blacks make up 51% of those arrested for murder.
-   A [2010 article](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7856787/Violent-inner-city-crime-the-figures-and-a-question-of-race.html)] by the _Sunday Telegraph_ released similar findings regarding violent crime in London. It reports that “the majority of men held responsible by police for gun crimes, robberies and street crimes are black.” Specifically, the findings were that “among those proceeded against for street crimes, 54 per cent were black; for robbery, 59 per cent; and for gun crimes, 67 per cent.”
-   [Data](https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023234/https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/disclosure_2019/february_2019/information-rights-unit---ethnicity-of-perpetrators-and-victims-of-knife-crime-in-london-from-april-2008-to-november-2018)] from the Metropolitan Police Service shows that blacks (or “Afro-Caribbeans”) committed 48% of knife crimes in London during the years 2008-2018 (14,527 out of 30,486) despite accounting for only 13% of the London population.
-   The Metropolitan Police Service serves a [homicide dashboard](https://www.met.police.uk/sd/stats-and-data/met/homicide-dashboard/) that contains information on homicide victims and homicide offenders in London since 2003. During 2003-2019, blacks committed 1,489 homicides out of a total of 3,635, which means black people committed 41% of homicides. In 2019, blacks committed 93 out of 212 (44%) of all homicides. Note that this is nearly _double_ the number of homicides committed by whites (52) in the same year. This is despite the fact that the proportion of the city that is white (60%) is nearly 5 times the proportion of the city that is black (13%) ([Ethnic groups in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20191224090124/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_London)]). This means that the homicide rate for blacks in London is over 8 times the rate for whites. This disparity is even larger than what is found in the United States.

### Canada

Blacks are incarcerated at far higher rates than non-blacks in Canada:

-   A [fact sheet](https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608023409/https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-7-racialized-poverty-in-justice-policing-2.pdf)] by the [Colour of Poverty](https://colourofpoverty.ca/fact-sheets/) reported “In 2016, black people comprise 3.5% of the general Canadian population, but made up 10% of the federally incarcerated population.”
-   The same fact sheet reported that “In 2016, 40% of inmates in segregation at the Toronto South Detention Centre were black, while being 7.5% of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area”
-   A [2014 analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274314275_Race_Crime_and_Criminal_Justice_in_Canada)] in the _Oxford Handbook of Ethnicity, Crime, and Immigration_ reported that “Even though blacks represented only 2.5 percent of the Canadian population at the time of this study, they represented 8.4% all federally supervised offenders” [Table 1]. The same analysis reported that the rate of correctional supervision for black people is 4 times higher than the white rate (page 6/27).
-   A [1997 study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1147637?seq=1) published in Crime and Justice shows that the racial disparities in imprisonment are even starker when we look at the imprisonment rate of males in Ontario. The study reveals that, among males, the prison admission rate for blacks was “6,796 per 100,000, compared to 1,326 for whites and 3,600 for Aboriginals. These incarcerations statistics show the same pattern as the data from the United States” (page 481).

As in the United States and in the United Kingdom, the disproportionate black imprisonment in Canada is the result of disproportionate black _criminality_:

-   In a [2007 case study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228395730_Effective_Crime_Prevention_in_Toronto_Canada) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228395730_Effective_Crime_Prevention_in_Toronto_Canada)] prepared for _Enhancing Urban Safety and Security_, researchers report that during the years 1992 through 2001, “the average annual homicide rate per 100,000 blacks in Toronto was almost five times higher than the overall homicide rate (10.1 compared with 2.4 per 100,000 population.” They note that “this pattern parallels that in the U.S.” (page 6)
-   A [2013 commentary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974223/pdf/41997_2013_Article_BF03405647.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024744/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974223/pdf/41997_2013_Article_BF03405647.pdf)] published in the _Canadian Journal of Public Health_ revealed that between 1992 and 2003, young blacks accounted for 30% of murder victims and 36% of offenders in Toronto area homicides, even though they only represented about 10% of Toronto’s population. The commentary also notes that the murder rate of black Toronto residents has risen from 2.4 per 100,000 in the 1990s to 10.1 per 100,000 in 2004, despite an overall decline in violent crime during this period (page 12).
-   In a [2014 commentary](https://scinapse.io/papers/2025963420) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024845/https://health.gradstudies.yorku.ca/files/2016/09/The-Canadian-war-on-drugs-Structural-violence-and-unequal-treatment-of-blacks.pdf?x35134)] published in the _International Journal of Drug Policy_ on the impact of Canadian drug law policies on black communities, it was revealed that “homicide rates among blacks in Montreal were estimated to be as high as 24 per 100,000, strikingly higher than their white counterparts at 3 per 100,000” (page 193). This implies that the black homicide rate is 8 times the white homicide rate, an even larger disparity than what is found in the United States.
-   The previously linked study shows that blacks are disproportionately imprisoned in every province. It shows that “sizeable black populations in Ontario and Nova Scotia represented 3.8% and 2.1% of provincial populations from 2010 to 2011, respectively, but accounted for 18% and 14% of admissions to Ontario and Nova Scotian jails (Owusu-Bempah & Wortley, 2014). This trend also holds true in provinces with less significant proportions of blacks. In New Brunswick, blacks only account for 0.6% of the population; nevertheless they represent 2.4% of the province’s inmates. Similarly, in Alberta, blacks represent 1.4% of the province’s residents but 5% of its prison population” (page 192).

As in the United States, black children in Canada exhibit misconduct very early. A [fact sheet](https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-3-racialized-poverty-in-education-learning-3.pdf) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608024914/https://colourofpoverty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cop-coc-fact-sheet-3-racialized-poverty-in-education-learning-3.pdf)] by the [Colour of Poverty](https://colourofpoverty.ca/fact-sheets/) reported that "black students were 12% of the Toronto District School Board student population but represented 48% of all expulsions; Indigenous students were 0.3% of the student population and 1% of all expulsions; Eastern, Mediterranean and Southwest Asian students were 4% of the population but 8% of all expulsions."

### Other countries

It is more difficult to find crime statistics by race in other countries. But all the data that I've found shows that persons of African ancestry are more likely to engage in criminality:

-   **Switzerland**: a [2010 article](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/neue-statistik-tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-exjugoslawen/story/27784193) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/neue-statistik-tamilen-sind-krimineller-als-exjugoslawen/story/27784193)] published in a Swiss newspaper reported that “Men from Angola, Nigeria and Algeria receive six times more criminal complaints in Switzerland than Swiss men. In return, the Swiss are almost twice as criminal as immigrated Germans.” (translate the page to English)
-   **Germany**: in a [2016 article](https://www.unz.com/akarlin/immigrant-crime-in-germany/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.unz.com/akarlin/immigrant-crime-in-germany/)] published to the _Unz Review_, immigrants from African and Middle Eastern countries have considerably higher rates of murder and sexual assault than European and East Asian immigrants. Note: the linked source in this article is no longer valid.

-   **Brazil**: a [2019 article](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/brazils-violence-map-shows-alarming-trends) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/brazils-violence-map-shows-alarming-trends)] published in _Think Brazil_ reported that “In 2017, the number of blacks killed was almost three times higher than among non-blacks (a group encompassing white, Asian, and indigenous people).” A [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763365/) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20190928045040/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763365/)] published in _Aggression and Violent Behavior_ grouped the homicide rates by race and found that the homicide rate for blacks (34.6 per 100,000) was over 2 times the rate for whites (16.3), and over 5 times the rate for Asians (6.8) (see section 4.1). Trends in homicide rates can be found [here](https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608025123/https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-89102011000400015&script=sci_abstract)].
-   **South Africa**: a [2008 article](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/prisons-race-shock-426802) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/prisons-race-shock-426802)] published in a South African newspaper reported that the incarceration rate for the “Coloured” (651 per 100,000) and African population (342 per 100,000) was over five times the rate for the white and Indian population (60 per 100,000). A [2004 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242681486_Every_six_hours_a_woman_is_killed_by_her_intimate_partner_A_National_Study_of_Female_Homicide_in_South_Africa) [[archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20200608025121/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242681486_Every_six_hours_a_woman_is_killed_by_her_intimate_partner_A_National_Study_of_Female_Homicide_in_South_Africa)] on female homicides in South Africa found that the rate of intimate femicide for “Coloureds” (18.3 per 100,000) was 6 times the rate for whites (2.8 per 100,000), and the rate for Africans (8.9 per 100,000) was over 3 times the rate for whites.

### Around the world

Finally, we know that black people are more likely to engage in criminality (compared to whites) around the world:

-   When we look at [the national homicide rates of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), we find that countries with predominantly black populations (e.g. nations in the Caribbean and Subsaharan Africa) tend to have far higher homicide rates than European and Asian countries.
-   Finally, consider [_The Handbook of Crime Correlates_](https://archive.org/details/LeeEllisKevinM.BeaverJohnWrightHandbookOfCrimeCorrelates/page/n7/mode/2up), a huge book published in 2009 that collects the summary analysis of crime research around the world. Table 2.3.2a summarized the results of a large number of studies that compared the rates of violent crime by blacks and whites in North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Oceania. _Every_ study found that being black was significantly associated with criminality. Also, every study that compared the rates of non-violent criminal and delinquent behavior found that being black was significantly associated with property offenses, drug offenses, and delinquency (Table 2.3.2b).

I searched for crime rates by race in every country that has sizable black and non-black populations. Many countries outright ban collecting crime statistics broken out by race or ethnicity, so it was difficult to find this data for certain countries (e.g. France, Sweden, etc.). Based on my research, the same general pattern is found in every country that publishes crime statistics broken out by race: blacks are much more likely to engage in criminal activity than whites, who are less likely to engage in criminality than Asians. The disparity seems to be most pronounced for more serious crimes. For example, in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, one finds that the black homicide rate falls within 5-8 times the white homicide rate.

## Final Thoughts

----------

This post is agnostic with respect to the cause of the widespread black criminality. I investigate the causes of black criminality in separate posts [here](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/poor-explanations-of-black-criminality/) and [here](https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/causes-of-disproportionate-black-criminality/). This post is also agnostic with respect to prescriptions or recommendations. The point here is simply to collect data relevant to the topic of black criminality. This is important to ensure that we are adequately informed when we investigate possible causes of and solutions to this problem.
