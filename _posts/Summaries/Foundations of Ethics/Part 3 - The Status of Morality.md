# Part 3 - The Status of Morality

## Ethical Relativism

Rather than allow us as we actually are (warts and all) to have the final word in morality, we should make the desires and choices of ideal observers the ultimate standard of morality. According to this new and improved version of subjectivism, an act is morally right just because I would favor it were I fully informed and perfectly rational. 

### Benefits

This will surely correct some of the problems that we have noted: 
1. Even the core moral beliefs of individuals and societies may now be mistaken, as their views may fail to measure up to those of the ideal observers.
2. The views of individuals and societies will not be morally equivalent, since some will better match those of the ideal observers.
3. The sincere endorsements of slavery and genocide will not automatically be morally authoritative, since such endorsements are almost always based on ignorance and irrationality. 
4. Moral progress will now be possible, and will occur when the moral views of individuals and societies more closely
reflect those of ideal observers. 
5. There will be real disagreement between conflicting moral views, since moral judgments will not be reports of personal opinion or cultural consensus, but will rather be claims about what ideal observers will approve of.

### Problems

1. The first occurs if there is ever any disagreement among ideal observers. The ideal observer view says that perfectly rational and intelligent people create morality through their choices. If that is so, then if such people make confl icting choices, this will cause contradictions. And contradictions fatally undermine any theory that contains them.

Responses:
- Perhaps perfectly smart and rational people will never disagree about anything. But why the optimism? Those who know all there is to know about embryology, for instance, might still morally disagree about abortion. Aft er all, on the ideal observer views, such geniuses are not trying to understand the morality of the actions they are assessing. Before they make their decisions, there is no morality.
- The strategy tells us that an action is morally required or forbidden only if all ideal observers agree in their attitudes about it. 

2. But another problem cannot be handled so easily. The view on the table says this: nothing is intrinsically right; things become right just because an ideal observer would favor it. But what if such people thought that killing off the mentally ill was a great idea? What if they thought that sadism was preferable to compassion? What if they approved of apartheid policies?

Responses:
- You might think such a thing impossible. But why? Evil people need not be factually ignorant or illogical. Vast knowledge doesn’t guarantee a sympathetic nature. Greater logical skills don’t automatically translate to greater kindness. Even the most rational and well informed among us can be biased, hateful, and cruel.
- These morally all-powerful people either are or aren’t basing their decisions on good reasons. If there are no good reasons to support their decisions, then the decisions are arbitrary, and cannot be the basis of a morality worthy of our respect. But if there are good reasons to support the decisions, then the reasons, rather than the decision, determine the morality of the actions in question.

My Response:
- It seems fair to say that it would be impossible for *all* fully rational and fully informed beings to support killing the mentally ill or that sadism was preferable to compassion, or apartheid. Firstly, we're dealing with fully rational and fully informed beings of *all* current humans, even those who might be the *victims* of such policies. Secondly, we might even have to strip away agents' particular characteristics that they find themselves in, i.e. where their place in society would be, their actual intelligence, etc.
- We might need to rigify the content of ideal endorsements by fixing an aim of the ideal observers. Namely, we would have to presuppose that they have the aim of finding principles that can be justified to others on grounds that no one with similar aims could reasonably refuse. The idea is that this aim is fixed because it is embedded in our moral discourse and practice. We're trying to provide reasons that other people can be receptive to.
- In response the the "good reasons" response, reasons are also constructions of ideal endorsement.

## Moral Nihilism

Problems with expressivism

1. How Is It Possible to Argue Logically about Morality? 
- Logical implications of normative statements are not based on the content of the normative concepts. Rather, it is based on the psychological dispositions that we take other agents to adopt when they have normative judgments. E.g. we expect someone who judges that F(X) -> X is wrong and believes that F(Y) to also judge that Y is wrong, even if judgments of wrongness are non-cognitive. Even if they don't initially recognize Y to be wrong, they can realize that they would recognize that it is wrong if they were against conflicting attitudes, and because they are against holding conflicting attitudes, this can motivate them to actually see Y as wrong. The basis of normative judgments is to avoid conflict and seek coherence. We speak logically about morality because our psychological tends towards coherence and unity, whether than because they correspond to some reality.
- This proves too much. Surely, there are some evaluative judgments that are non-cognitive which we can argue logically about, e.g. aesthetics.
2. Expressivism and Amoralists. 
- They are just referring to what the society refers to as morally obligatory without sincerely making a judgment. Or to what society would endorse if they were fully rational/informed.
- They are expressing a kind of disposition to have a certain attitude if they were in a certain circumstances, i.e. if they were interested in intersubjective justification. So it's a claim about what certain people have reasons to do, but it's a third-party claim of reasons. One can make a third-party claim about reasons without being appropriately motivated, even if reasons judgments are at bottom expressions of endorsement. 
3. The Nature of Moral Judgment. The best way to tell whether people are joking, questioning, inviting, or trying to state the truth is simply to ask them. People are usually pretty trustworthy on this score. (Not always, of course. When we play to win at poker, or negotiate a business deal, we may be deliberately misleading.) Still, exceptions aside, people are the best judges of their own intentions, and their testimony in such matters is usually reliable.
- This proves too much. The entire foundation of conceptual analysis relies on the idea that we are sometimes mistaken with our concepts and unclear in our meanings.

## Arguments against Objectivity

### There are no categorical reasons

There are no categorical reasons. Suppose you are hiking along a cliff path and notice a stranger who is absent-mindedly walking from the opposite direction. You see that he’s about to take a wrong step and plunge to his death. Th ere is a reason to yell to him and alert him of the danger. And that reason applies to you even if you don’t care a bit about the man or about the pats on the back you’ll receive when the story gets out. 
- Question begging?

### Moral motivation undermines objectivity

1. Moral judgments are able, all by themselves, to motivate those who make them.
2. Beliefs are never able, all by themselves, to motivate those who hold them.
3. Therefore, moral judgments are not beliefs.
4. If moral judgments are not beliefs, then they can’t be true.
5. Therefore, moral judgments can’t be true

Some objectivists criticize 1, while accepting 2. They say that moral judgments are beliefs; beliefs cannot motivate all by themselves; and therefore moral judgments cannot motivate all by themselves. Moral judgments, like all beliefs, need a supplemental desire in order to move people to action. It’s possible that sincere moral judgments leave us entirely cold. True, since most people have moral concerns and want (at least a little) to be moral, moral judgments will motivate most of the people who make them. But some people just don’t care about morality. They judge things right or wrong and yet are completely unmoved. And that shows that premise 1 is false. Moral judgments cannot move people all by themselves. 
- This proves too much. Of course, individuals in a society with culturally constructed motivational concepts can use those concepts non-motivationally applying the consensus extension (or a fully rational/informed version of teh consensus) but this doesn't make the judgment sincere. E.g. I can say that a certain action is dishonorable in an Islam society without being motivated, but that doesn't mean the practice underlying the concept of honor isn't fundamentally based on motivation, nor does it mean there's some objective truth to what is or isn't honorable.
- Imagine a seperate culture that had systems of blame/shame/guilt that were the opposite of our own. Would we judge them to be amoralists, or people that were motivated to be what they thought was immoral? Are they making a judgment about what is moral and then are motivated to do the opposite? No, we would say that had different moral judgments.
- Some objectivists criticize 1, while accepting 2. Th ey say that moral judgments are beliefs; beliefs cannot motivate all by themselves; and therefore moral judgments cannot motivate all by themselves. Moral judgments, like all beliefs, need a supplemental desire in order to move people to action.

### Values are not scientific

1. If science cannot verify the existence of X, then the best evidence tells us that X does not exist. 
2. Science cannot verify the existence of objective moral values.
3. Therefore, the best evidence tells us that objective moral values do
not exist.

1. Moral naturalists could claim, for instance, that being morally right is nothing other than maximizing happiness, or that being good is the very same thing as being desired. We can use scientific means to check whether happiness is maximized, or whether people really desire things. On this view, moral features are nothing but a special class of scientific features. Moral naturalists thus reject premise 2 of the argument, because they think that moral features just are natural (that is, not supernatural) features of our world. But are moral features really needed to explain anything? Naturalists say yes. They think, for instance, that Stalin’s evil nature is what explains his sending millions to their death in prison camps. The wrongness of slavery explains why slaves and abolitionists opposed it. The injustice of child abuse explains our anger when we learn of it, the child’s resentment, and our efforts to protect children from it.
2. Objectivists who share these doubts about naturalism thus accept premise 2 of the current argument. Th ey agree that science cannot verify the existence of objective moral values. These objectivists must therefore criticize premise 1, and its claim that science is the ultimate measure of reality. Their best strategy is to draw our attention to the fact that moral features are normative features. Normative features are those that tell us how things ought to be, or how we should behave. They rely on norms: standards of behavior that supply us with ideals or requirements.

There is some reason to deny that science really does have the final word on everything. Consider this:
(T) A claim is true only if science can verify it

(T) can’t be true. For science cannot verify it. (T) is not a scientific statement. We cannot test its truth by analyzing what we see, hear, taste, feel, or smell. We cannot mathematically test it. There are no lab experiments that will confirm it.
