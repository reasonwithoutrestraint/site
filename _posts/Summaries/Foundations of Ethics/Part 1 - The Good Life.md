# Part 1: The Good Life

### Chapter 1 Hedonism: Its Powerful Appeal

There is only a single thing that is intrinsically valuable: happiness. 
Everything else is valuable only to the extent that it makes us happy. 
Likewise, there is just one thing that is intrinsically bad: unhappiness. 
Unhappiness is the only thing that directly reduces our quality of life

Two fundamental kinds of pleasure: physical pleasure and attitudinal pleasure (enjoyment). 
- Physical pleasure: The first kind is the sort we experience when we taste a delicious fall apple, or when we let the jets from a hot tub dissolve the tension in our backs. These very different kinds of pleasurable feelings usually make us happy, at least for the moment. But such feelings are not the same thing as happiness.
- As the hedonist understands it, happiness is attitudinal pleasure: the positive attitude of enjoyment. It can range in intensity from mild contentment to elation. Being happy does not necessarily feel like anything; there is no special sensation or physical quality associated with happiness. I can enjoy a home-team victory or a beautiful painting without experiencing any physical pleasure.

### Chapter 2 Is Happiness All That Matters? 

#### The Paradox of Hedonism

1. If happiness is the only thing that directly makes us better off, then it is rational to single-mindedly pursue it.
2. It isn’t rational to do that.
3. Therefore, happiness isn’t the only thing that directly makes us better off.

Premise 1 is suspect, precisely because the direct pursuit of good things sometimes prevents us from getting them. Th ink of the professional golfer in the midst of a slump. She desperately wants to regain her swing. But the more she focuses on this, the harder it becomes. Or consider the immature student who wants more than anything to be well liked, and so tries, way too eagerly and very annoyingly, to be pals with his classmates. Such behavior is self-defeating. He’d be much better off trying less hard.

#### Evil Pleasures

1. If hedonism is true, then happiness that comes from evil deeds is as good as happiness that comes from kind and decent actions.
2. Happiness that comes from evil deeds is not as good as happiness that comes from kind and decent actions.
3. Therefore, hedonism is false.

This argument fails, and it’s instructive to see why. There is a confusion contained within it, and it’s one that is easy to make. When we say that happiness that comes from one source is as good as happiness from any other source, we might mean that each is morally equivalent to the other. But this is not what hedonists have in mind. They don’t think that each episode of happiness is as morally good as every other. Rather, they think that the same amount of happiness, no matter its source, is equally beneficial. Hedonists therefore reject premise 2

#### The Two Worlds

1. If hedonism is true, then any two situations containing identical amounts of happiness and unhappiness are equally good.
2. Some such situations are not equally good; some are better than others.
3. Therefore, hedonism is false

Ross invited us to consider two worlds that contain identical amounts of happiness and misery. In one of these, the people are all virtuous; in the other, they are all vicious. Hedonism tells us that these worlds are equally good. No one believes this. There are nonhuman sources of happiness and misery, such as disease. So imagine, in the virtuous world, that its extra happiness is off set by greater misery resulting from disease. Still, the virtuous world is better than the vicious one.

But hedonists can reject the first. Their view is not about what makes a situation or a world good, but rather about what makes a life good for the person who lives it. Hedonism, as it stands, doesn’t tell us how to determine the value of a world. And so it is not committed to the view that two worlds containing equal amounts of happiness must be equally good.

1. If hedonism is true, then our lives go well to the extent that we are happy.
2. It’s not the case that our lives go well to the extent that we are happy; those whose happiness is based on false beliefs have worse lives than those whose happiness is based on true beliefs, even if both lives are equally happy.
3. Therefore, hedonism is false

#### The Importance of Autonomy

In short, we want autonomy—the power to guide our life through our own free choices — even if it sometimes costs us our happiness.

1. If hedonism is true, then autonomy contributes to a good life only insofar as it makes us happy.
2. Autonomy sometimes directly contributes to a good life, even when it fails to make us happy.
3. Therefore, hedonism is false

#### Life’s Trajectory

1. If hedonism is true, then the overall quality of a life depends entirely on the amount of happiness and unhappiness it contains.
2. The overall quality of life depends on at least one other factor: whether one’s life refl ects an “upward” or “downward” trajectory.
3. Therefore, hedonism is false.

#### Unhappiness as a Symptom of Harm

1. If hedonism is true, then you can be harmed by something only because it saddens you.
2. You can be harmed in other ways.
3. Th erefore, hedonism is false.

### Chapter 3 Getting What You Want

The desire satisfaction theory of human welfare takes this sort of criticism very seriously. The theory tells us that your life goes well for you to the extent that you get what you want. Something is good for you if it satisfies your desires, only if it satisfies your desires, and because it satisfies your desires. At the other end of the spectrum, your life goes badly just when your desires are frustrated.

Attractions:
- A Variety of Good Lives
- Personal Authority

Objective theories of human welfare state that what contributes to a good life is fixed independently of your desires and your opinions about what is important. Some theories, for instance, insist that the more knowledge you have, the better your life is going for you—even if you don’t care very much about obtaining knowledge. (I’m skeptical of such a view: is your life really better now that you know I have a cat named Oscar?) Other theories insist that virtue is required for a good life, no matter how you feel about virtue’s importance. Hedonists claim that happiness is intrinsically valuable—even if, very unusually, you don’t care about being happy.

#### Motivation

First Motivational Argument

1. If X is truly good for you, then you will be motivated to get X—so long as you know about X and know how to get it.
2. Many people who know about wealth and know how to get it aren’t motivated to become wealthy.
3. Therefore, wealth will not improve the lives of such people.

Second Motivational Argument

1. If something is truly good for you, then it will satisfy your desires.
2. If something will satisfy your desires, then you will be motivated (at least to some extent) to get it—so long as you know what you want and know how to get it.
3. Therefore, if something is truly good for you, then you will be motivated (at least to some extent) to get it—so long as you know what you want and know how to get it.

#### Self-Interest

Argument for why we have reason to want our lives to be better off:

1. If something makes us better off, then it satisfies our desires.
2. If something satisfies our desires, then we have reason to obtain it.
3. Therefore, if something makes us better off, then we have reason to obtain it.

#### Knowledge of the Good

If the desire theory is correct, then we have a straightforward answer to one of life’s eternal questions: how can I know what is good for me? The answer is simple: be clear about what you want. Then make sure you know how to get it.

### Chapter 4 Problems for the Desire Theory 

Getting What You Want May Not Be Necessary for Promoting Your Good

1. Pleasant Surprises. => This is good becuase you desire pleasure.
2. Small children and the severely mentally handicapped. => This is good because they desire the approval of their future selves. Or we identify the person at an earlier time with themselves at a future time (the impartial perspective point).
3. Suicide Prevention => Same as above.

#### Modifications

Remove False Belief
- If something fulfills our informed desires (i.e., those not based on false beliefs), then that thing is good for us.

Focus on self-regarding desires:
- If something has fulfilled our informed, self-regarding desires, then that thing is good for us.

Modification for disappointing desires? Suppose that you form a self-regarding desire that isn’t based on any false beliefs. And you get what you want. If seeing your desires come true only makes you miserable, then how could this mark an improvement in your life? The Desire Theory commits us to saying that you are better off in such a case. Th is is very diffi cult to accept.

Consider another modification:
- If something has fulfilled our informed, self-regarding desires, and we are pleased as a result of this, then that thing is good for us.

This won't work unless we posit pleasure as being intrinsically valuable.

==> People desire pleasure for its own sake.
==> "The good life" is ambiguous. They have reason to pursue those interests, but it doesn't make them better off from the impartial perspective. 

#### Ignorance of Desire Satisfaction. 

If someone's desires are satisfied, but they aren't aware of this, this doesn't seem to make their lives better off.

==> "The good life" is ambiguous. They have reason to pursue those interests, but it doesn't make them better off from the impartial perspective. 

#### Impoverished Desires. 

It doesn't allow us to evaluate competing desires. Our desires, however, are often shaped by the way we have been raised. The expectations that we have been taught to have are especially important influences. And this creates a problem. We may have oppressive parents or societies where we desires to be oppressed or subordinate.

==> We assume they do value what they would desire in better circumstances. It's constituitive of being an agent. So they actually do have reason to rid themselves of the impovershed desires. Even if they didn't desire this (and thus didn't have reason to rid their desires), this can still be better off with different desires. E.g. See that "The Good" is ambiguous.

#### The Paradox of Self-Harm and Self-Sacrifice. 

What if people want to harm themselves? This needn’t be irrational. For instance, people may feel remorse for wrongs they have done, and want to do penance. Others may despise themselves, full of self-loathing, convinced that they deserve only harm, rather than good. No matter their ultimate motive, they deeply want to harm themselves. 

The desire theory denies this: if such people satisfy their selfdestructive or self-sacrifi cing desires, then the theory says that they are better off! So long as they get what they really want, then they must be benefited as a result. And yet their fondest wish is to harm or to sacrifice themselves. So the desire theory generates a paradox: wanting to harm or sacrifice yourself makes it impossible to do so. 

Since it does seem possible both to want such things and to succeed, the desire theory is suspect.

==> We identify the person at an earlier time with themselves at a future time. So their future desires play a role.
==> "The good life" is ambiguous. We could have reason to desire/intent to pursue what would not be desired from an impartial observer's perspective. 

#### The Fallibility of Our Deepest Desires. 

I am thinking here of suicide, where the would-be suicide is regarding her death not as a harm, but rather as a benefit. She is not trying to make herself worse off . Rather, she is trying to improve her life—by ending it. 

On their view, your desires determine how well your life is going. If this person is clear-eyed, and sees that he is getting very little of what he wants, then his life really is going poorly. Further, he may be quite self-aware about what he is likely to want in the future—a relationship with his former lover—and realize that this desire is bound to be frustrated. If so, then his life is not going to improve.

What we want to tell such a person is this: change your desires! Stop wanting her so much. (Not that this is easy. Not that it can happen overnight.) But suppose that he won’t, and that he knows this. We tell him to change his desires, because his current obsession is only causing him misery and preventing him from taking an interest in what really matters. Yet from the desire theorist’s perspective, such advice is fundamentally mistaken. Th ings matter only to the extent that you care about them. So happiness is important only so long as we want it. 

Consider the following cases, offered by philosopher Joel Feinberg. The first is that of an exhibitionist who exposes himself in public, not to solicit or threaten others, but just because he wants, as Feinberg puts it, “exposure for exposure’s sake.” Or a kleptomaniac—in Feinberg’s example, a high school student, who was otherwise as normal as you or I, but who was caught in possession of twenty-one shirt buttons, seven pairs of clippers, nine bike wrenches, fi ve pocket mirrors and a variety of oil cans, violin strings, and combs. He didn’t intend to use these things for any purpose at all. He just wanted them in their own right. 

==> This person might not be informed on the kind of life they will have in the future.
==> The person has a desire for their future desires as well. This desire should reign supreme.
==> Thomas Scanlon: a desire is only a desire if we see it as providing a reason for action, not just if it has motivational force.
==> Michael Smith: desires in unsound states of mind can be dismissed.
