# Wrongness and Reasons

## Overview

This purpose of this chapter is to explain the reason-giving force of judgments of right and wrong.
Note that this simultaneously explains the motivating force of moral judgments because a rational creature naturally does what they take themselves to have reason to do.
More specifically, it is concerned not just with *understanding* the reasons underlying moral judgments, but also *justifying* why those reasons are important.
Note that "justification" does not amount to an argument that can convince amoralists that morality follows from certain considerations that they implicitly endorse.
Nor does it imply that without such a justification, those who are concerned with morality might abandon it.
Rather, justification is concerned with explaining the moral "must" in two ways:
(1) Priority: the judgment that moral wrongness is almost always sufficient reason not to do an action
(2) Importance: the judgment that an amoralists suffers from a serious fault

There are two possible characterization of the reason-giving force of morality: substantive and formal characterizations.
These amount to different answers to Prichard's dilemma of "Why be moral?" - he says answers that presuppose moral ends are trivial, and answers independent of moral ends (e.g. personal benefit) are inappropriate.
Formal explanations appeal to considerations independent of any particular ends (e.g. Kant, Habermas) by showing that morality is somehow inescapable.
Substantive explanations characterize the particular value that is concerned with morailty (e.g. God's will, utilitarianism).
Formal explanations fail because they cannot explain the *importance* of morality and they problem that someone faces for ignoring them.
E.g. principles of logic are inescapable, but someone who ignores them is not wrong in the same as an amoralist.
Substantive considerations therefore are more promising, even though they risk triviality.

Contractualism offers a substantive account of moral motivation. 
It says: an act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any set of principles for the general regulation of behavior that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement.
This does not depend on human psychology or social conditioning.
It depends on our reasons to want to live with others on grounds that could be justified with others.
There are three reasons to accept this account
(1) It seems phenomenologically accurate.
(2) It is the best response to Prichard's dilemma
(3) It accounts for many of the structural complexities of reasons connected with moral reasoning.

With regard to (3) above, contractualism exlpains the following features that shape our moral reasoning:
(1) Others could reasonably refuse to license us to decide how to act while refusing to acknowledge relevant moral factors (e.g. the interests of others). 
This explains why certain considerations are generally relevant moral reasons, and sometimes compelling.
(2) Being moral involves seeing certain features as providing no justification in certain contexts, despite their relevance in other contexts. 
E.g. that it would be slightly inconvenient to keep a promise is no reason to break the promise.
This is explained because others could reasonably refuse to license us to count them as reasons.
(3) There is no fixed list of morally relevant or irrelevant considerations.
The aim of justifiability allows for a system for determining relevant considerations.
It's a continuing process of revising and refining what reasons are relevant.

Contractualism explains the *importance* of moral judgments.
The issue is not to explain a special rational force that moral reasons have over agents.
Rather, it is to explain the special flaw attributed to amoralists from the perspective of agents already concerned with morality.
This is explained because the reasons a person accepts affects the kind of relations we can have with them.
Often, these effects are local (e.g. music, chess, etc.), so they can still be a good neighbor or friend.
But a failure to be concerned with justifiability to others is not local. 
It concerns their attitude not to some external value but their attitude towards us.

Contractualism can also explain the priority to give to moral reasons as opposed to other reasons.
There is a general three-part strategy to resolving conflicts being morality and any proposed additional values:
(1) Argue that insofar as these are things we have reason to pursue/value, these will be among the reasons that make it reasonable to reject certain principles. 
Thus, there will be pressure to make (defeasible) room for these values in justifying certain principles.
(2) Insofar as there are conflicts, we have reason to give priority to morality. 
This can be argued by showing how other values implicitly assume sensitivity to moral requirements.
E.g. friendship implies valuing justifiability to your friend *qua* personhood (rather than *qua* friend).
If this cannot be done, then we appeal to the great importance of justifiability to others over other values.
(3) A more mixed argument is required for the value of pursuits and excellences, e.g. science and art. 
Firstly, the values involved in these cases are forms of collective human activity. 
Thus, they will be sensitive to the requirements of justifiability to others.

Morality in terms of "what we owe to each other" is used in a narrow, interpersonal sense rather than morality broadly.
It refers to duties such as duties not to kill, harm, deceive, to keep promises, etc.
But morality is sometiems used in a more broad sense.
E.g. the proper form of sexual conduct is sometiems seen as a central moral question.
E.g. the special concern we should have for friends, loved ones, etc.
E.g. it might be seen as a moral deficiency to not develop one's talents or to fail to see the value in certain works of nature.
Morality is actually used to refer to a diverse set of values, and contractualism only characterizes a central part of this territory.
The motivation involved with the values mentioned above are distinct from the motivation involved in "what we owe to each other."

The scope of morality includes beings whom we have reason to want our actions to be justifiable.
This is broader than beings with whom it is advantageous to enter into a mutual restraint and cooperation.
This is no broader than conscious beings, because these are the only beings to which we can be justifiable.
This includes all agents with judgment-sensitive attitudes (rational creatures) and potentially non-rational creatures. 
Contractualism may be able to account for non-rational creatures if we consider justification to a trustee.
If so, it can explain that causing pain to non-rational creatures is morally wrong in the same sense that it is wrong to a human, i.e. we "owe" it to such creatures not to cause pain.
If we neglect the trustee idea, the contractualism could still accept that it is morally wrong to cause pain to non-rational creatures.
However, this would be a use of the broader sense of "morality", not the sense of "what we owe to each other".
We can wrong a non-rational creature, but not in the same sense that we can wrong a rational creature.
The notion of trusteeship is not necessary for a contractualist theory.

## Moral Motivation

The problem of explaining motivation is to explain the reason-giving force of judgments of right and wrong.
The label "problem of motivation" is slightly misleading in two ways:
1. It suggests that we are concerned with motivation *as opposed to* reasons, but there's no distinction.
2. It suggests a problem of reasons/motivation for *action*.
The latter implies that we are concerned with how we can be motivated to act morally in the face of strong countervailing reasons. 
The latter suggestion is overly narrow interpretation.
Instead of being concerned with understanding what reasons we respond to when we consider right and wrong,
we should be concerned with *why* it's important that we respond to the reasons concerned with morality.

But saying that the question is about a "justification" for being moral can also be misleading for two reasons:
1. It suggests that those who already care about morality might abandon morality without a good justification.
2. It suggests that we are trying to persuade amoralists to care about morality by proving a justification.
These projects do not seem always possible.
We are concerned with addressing the problem of the moral "must" in two forms

1. Priority: That an action is wrong (almost) always constitutes sufficient reason to not do it.
2. Importance: Failure to respond to moral reasons seems to be a serious fault, but not one of irrationality.
The former concerns the attitudes of actors; the latter conerns evaluations by third-parties.
The latter doesn't just mean it's wrong *from a moral perspective*, but it's wrong in a more general sense.

## Formal and Substantive Accounts and Moral Motivation

Strategies for explaining the importance of morality can be analyzed along two dimensions.
They can be analyzed in terms of their moral content.
One could saw we have reason to be moral because that would be moral, but this faces triviality.
Another could be that we appeal to a nonmoral reason, such as personal benefits of being moral, but this seems inappropriate.
They can also be analyzed in terms of their degree of formality.
Formal explanations appeal to considerations independent of the appeal of any particular ends (e.g. Kant, Habermas).
Substantive explanations characterize the particular value concerned with morality.

Formal characterizations benefit by explaining the inescapability of morality in that they are rationally required.
The problem is that this doesn't explain what's wrong with someone who fails to respond to morality.
E.g. the special force of moral requirements differ from principles of logic which are also rationally required.
Substantive accounts therefore seem more promising, but they may not give strong explanations of priority and importance.
However, the widest support have been substantive - God's will, human telos, and utilitarianism.
Utilitiarianism seems plausible because it identifies a substantive value that is both connected with morality and something of importance from outside of morality.
Common utilitarian arguments state that human welfare is clearly something important, whereas care about rules seems arbitrary.

One problem with utilitarian accounts of right/wrong is that they are not sufficiently closely linked to our notions of right and wrong.
Actions can be wrong even though they have zero or even positive promotion of aggregate happiness.
Even when happiness is at stake, that alone does not account for the motivation we feel to be moral.
For example, when considering the wrong in not providing charity for another, the motivation isn't just how bad it is for those starving; it's the idea that one has done something *wrong* in not aiding them.

Mill addresses this by interpreting "wrong" to refer to actions that a person ought to be punished for doing either by law, public opinion or guilt.
However, this doesn't explain how an action being wrong provides a reason not to do it.
The fact that it would be good if there were these punishments against certain behaviors provides a reason to construct such punishments.
But it does not provide a reason not to do the action.

## A Conctractualist Account of Motivation

Contractualist offers such an account.
It says: an act is wrong if its performance under the circumstances would be disallowed by any set of principles for the general regulation of behavior that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced general agreement.
The normative content of this account shall be deferred until later chapters.
This overlaps somewhat with Mill's definition of wrongness: if we all have reason to want a certain kind of act to not be performed, then it is likely that any principles allowing those acts can be reasonably rejected (thus being wrong).
But this need not happen everytime: there may be acts which are not wrong even though there would be a greater balance of happiness if the acts were punished.

Note that contractualism doesn't appeal to a special psychological element of humans or social conditioning to explain our motivation to be moral.
Rather, it is explained by the fact that we have reason to want to live with others on grounds that could be justified with others, and the fact that rational agents are naturally motivated to do what they recognize themselves to have reason to do.
Note that we are motivated by principles that others could not *reasonably reject*, not principles that they *actually do accept*.
There are obvious cases where morality requires resisting the prevailing consensus.
In cases where morality is permits or requires conformity, this is due to a particular substanative judgment within morality.
The basis of moral thinking is the ideal of hypothetical agreement.

There are three reasons to accept this account of moral motivation:

1. It seems phenomenologically accurate.
2. It is the best response to Prichard's dilemma, which is explained below.
3. Justifiability accounts for many of the complexities of "moral motivation".
	Being moral involves not being moved to avoid certain actions "because they would be wrong".
	Being moral isn't just a matter of weighing the sanctions of moral wrongness against other reasons.
	It involves being moved by the concrete considerations such as "he needs my help".
	This is explained by the ideal of justifiability to others.
	It provides a higher-order reason (not a reason with a weight against conflicting reasons) to shape our process of practical thinking.
	There are three features of this shaping:

1. Others could reasonably refuse to license us to decide what to do while refusing to acknowledge various relevant moral factors (e.g. the interests of others).
	Thus, the aim of justifiability to others gives us reason to recognize those considerations as being generally relevant, and sometimes compelling.
2. "Being moral" involves seeing certain considerations as providing no justification in certain contexts, despite their relevance in other contexts.
	E.g. the fact that it would be slightly inconvenient to keep a promise is excluded from being a reason to break the proimse.
	It might be objected that we do have such reasons, but they are outweighed by other moral reasons.
	This does not seem intuitively correct. 
	The ideal of the fully moral person does not have to weigh the benefits of being immoral against the costs.
	While some extreme cases cause us to performing this weighted reasoning, most of the times degenerate considerations are excluded from reasoning.
	Contractualism explains this because others could reasonably refuse to license us to count these as reasons.
3. The "shaping" role is a dynamic one.
	There is no fixed list of morally (ir)relevant considerations.
	The aim of justifiability to others allows us to work out a system of justification.
	This leads to a continuing process of revising and refining our conception of the reasons that are (ir)relevant.

## Importance

An amoralist who is unmoved by morality seems to reveal a more important fault than failing to see the force of reasons of another kind.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, reason judgments are universal, so at least we can say the person fails to respond to reasons that apply to him.
But this is not sufficient to capture the seriousness of the failure.
People who fail to see the value of e.g. science, historical understanding, the Grand Canyon, etc. can be said to be "missing something" in that they are not recognizing a category of reasons and that their lives are therefore worse off.
But this is also not the fault we attribute to the amoralist.

The issue is not to explain a special rational force that moral reasons have over agents.
Rather it is to explain the special significance for people who are moved by moral reasons to assess other amoralists.
The special significance we attribute to amoralists can be explained because the reasons a person accepts affects the kind of relations we can have with them.
Often, these effects are local (e.g. if someone doesn't enjoy music, chess, etc.), so they can still be a good neighbor or friend.
But a failure to be concerned with justifiability to others is not local, because it concerns their attitude not to some external value but their attitude towards us.

## Priority

Now, consider the question of how morality is related to other values and how it makes sense to give it priority over them.
Recall that values can conflict in a deep sense when one value involves excluding another consideration's status as a reason.
There are two points to argue here:
1. Morality leaves room for other values. This will be explored in Chapter 5.
2. These other values, properly understood, give way to morality's demands when conflicts arise.
	This will be explained here as it reveals insight on the nature of moral motivation.

Instead of asking "Why be moral?", consider the question "why be loyal to friends when doing so requires sacrificing other goods?"
In answering the question, one faces an analogue of Prichard's dilemma.
To answer "because friendship requires it" seems to provide no answer.
To answer by citing values other than friendship seems to be the wrong kind of response. Such a person who was loyal for external reasons would not be a good friend.
The correct answer is to characterize friendship in a way that it is desirable in itself. 
This allows one to see how being a friend provides certain benefits (such as enjoyable companionship) while also showing how being a friend requires seeing loyalty as a sufficient reason for doing something despite a sacrifice.
A person who didn't see the benefits of friendship, or who didn't see loyalty as important unless for certain benefits would be no true friend.

A similar answer can be given for morality.
Contractualism characterizes the value that underly our reasons to do what morality requires.
Standing in a relation of mutual recognition is worth seeking for its own sake.
At the same time, this way of living with others is seen as a positive value.

Most people are concerned with standing in a relation of mutual recognition - of being able to justify oneself to others.
When faced with accusations that someone's actions cannot be justified, the response is usually to make amends or to deny the merit of the charges.
But when one denies the merits of another's complaint, this usually involves ignoring their complaints by trying not to think about their fate.
For most people, this is done with unease; they need to avert their thought to be comfortable.
The amoralist is the one would could disregard the fate of others without this unease and without averting attention.
One might ask, could such an amoralist engage in true friendship?

No. Friendship (as commonly understood) involves recognizing the friend as a seperate person with moral standing.
It involves seeing them as someone to whom justification is owed in his or her own right, not merely in virtue of being a friend.
There would be something unnerving about a "friend" who would steal a kidney for you if you need one.
This is not just because you would feel guilty, but also because of his view towards your own body parts: he wouldn't steal them, but only because he happens to life you.
The point is to show that there is a form of friendship that is worth valuing (one that we seem to value) that does not clash with the requirements of morality.
Compatibility with the demands of interpersonal morality is built into (this conception of) friendship.
Similar statements can be made about personal relations in general.
Of course, there are some conceptions of certain relations in certain real or action societies where morality is not built into the relation.
In that case, we are faced with a conflict.

There is a general three-part strategy to resolving conflicts being morality and any proposed additional values:
1. Argue that insofar as these are things we have reason to pursue/value, these will be among the reasons that make it reasonable to reject certain principles. Thus, there will be pressure to make (defeasible) room for these values in justifying certain principles.
2. Insofar as there are conflicts, we have reason to give priority to morality. 
	This can be argued by showing how other values implicitly assume sensitivity to moral requirements.
	If this cannot be done, then we appeal to the great importance of justifiability to others over other values.
3. A more mixed argument is required for the value of pursuits and excellences, e.g. science and art. 
	Firstly, the values involved in these cases are forms of collective human activity. Thus, they will be sensitive to the requirements of justifiability to others.

## Some Objections

One objection to the contractualist explanation of moral motivational might be put as follows:
Why not explain moral motivation as being responsive to the value of human life, rather than an idea of justification.
The problem with this is respecting human life is a matter of respecting their valid moral claims, and their valid moral claims depend on justification.
One response might be to deny that the validity of a moral claim depends on justification in two respects:
(1) the validity of an individual's moral claim is independent of and prior to justification.
(2) the reason-giving force of a valid moral claim is independent of and prior to justification. 
A strong objections mantains both (1) and (2), whereas a weaker objection only mantains (1).

The stronger objection could be argued either negatively or positively.
Either negatively, by arguing that contractualism does not intuitively describe the reasons concerned with morality.
This chapter is meant to account for such worries.
Or Positively, by arguing for an alternatively account of the motivational power of morality.
Such accounts cannot be generally refuted without considering each possibility.
But generally, insofar as they avoid the "triviality" horn of Prichard's dilemma, they fail the intuitive connection with morality that substantive characterizations provide.

The weaker objection denies that contractualism can be given content without appealing to an independent standard of right and wrong.
This thesis shall be argued against in later chapters.

Another objection is to say that contractualism is excessively restrictive.
It is impossible to account for all the reasons that every human might have for rejecting a principle. 
Every principle is one that someone can have a reason to object to, so all of them will be wrong.
To avoid this, we avoid considering how every actual individual would feel about it.
We consider only representative cases, and take into account only objections a person could raise, while recognizing the force of similar objections by others.

## Fragmentation of the Moral

Morality in terms of "what we owe to each other" is used in a narrow, interpersonal sense.
It refers to duties such as duties not to kill, harm, deceive, to keep promises, etc.
But morality is sometiems used in a more broad sense.
E.g. the proper form of sexual conduct is sometiems seen as a central moral question.
E.g. the special concern we should have for friends, loved ones, etc.
E.g. it might be seen as a moral deficiency to not develop one's talents or to fail to see the value in certain works of nature.
These braoder uses of morality is not under analysis in the sense of "what we owe to each other".
Morality is actually used to refer to a diverse set of values, and contractualism only characterizes a central part of this territory.
The motivation involved with the values mentioned above are distinct from the motivation involved in "what we owe to each other."

## The Scope of Morality

The question of which creatures we have moral duties towards is addressed here because it depends on the moral motivation described in this chapter.
There are two types of criticisms against contractualist conceptions of the scope of morality:
(1) it provides no basis for the scope, because it must begin with a set of contracting parties.
(2) It is too restrictive, since a contract requires parties who are able to make and keep agreements.
Contractualism avoids these objections because the force of morality is not an agreement for mutual advantage.
The force of contractualism is in the reason we have for wanting to stand in a certain relation with others - a relation of mutual justifiability.

The scope of morality includes beings whom we have reason to want our actions to be justifiable.
The scope of morality is narrower than the class of beings that can have a good.
Contractualism is only concerned with beings that are conscious because the only way something can be justifiable *to* a creature is if that being is conscious.
The scope is broader than the class of beings with whom it is advantageous to enter into a system of mutual restraint and cooperation, because we have reason to justify our actions even to agents outside of this category.
The scope is broader than the class of beings who engage in moral reasoning.
Because it makes sense for justifiability to apply to a creature who could adopt any judgment
sensitive attitude, even if they couldn't make moral judgments (i.e. this probably extends slightly if at all beyond the class of humans).
The question is whether to restrict the scope to creatures with judgment-sensitive attitudes or broaden it to conscious creatures.
There are two ways to respond.

The first is to limit the scope of morality (in terms of what we owe to each other) to creatures with judgment-sensitive attitudes.
One could still say that it is "morally" wrong to cause suffering to non-rational conscious creatures.
But this would be the broader kind of "morality" discussed earlier that is distinct from the morality of what we owe to each other.
The wrong we cause to non-rational creatures in causing them pain is distinct from the wrong we cause to raitonal creatures in causing them pain.
The reason is because justifiability doesn't make sense to these creatures.
However, this is not necessary to say we don't have moral reason to not harm them in some broader sense.
We believe that we have prima facie reason to avoid pain in general, whether for a rational or non-rational creature.
This is why it's wrong to cause pain to a rational creature, but it is *also* wrong because we *owe* it to a rational creature not to cause pain, because the creature could reasonably reject the harm.

Another way of responding is to include all conscious creatures under the narrow sense of morality by invoking the idea of a trustee.
Instead of asking what is justifiable to a non-rational conscious creature, we ask what is justifiable for a rational trustee of the non-rational creature.
This allows us to say that torturing non-rational creatures is wrong in the same sense as torturing a human.
I.e. it's wrong not just because it's bad and we have prima facie reason to prevent pain, but also because we *owe* it to non-rational creatures. 
I.e. we should feel guilty *to* the animal, just like we can feel guilty to a human.
A trustee would be concerned with the well-being of its associated creature, where well-being is purely in terms of experiential qualities, since there is no rational aims of such a creature.

Either response can work for a contractualist theory.
It depends on how far the idea of trusteeship goes.
Scanlon leans towards the first response, saying that one cannot wrong non-rational animals in the way that is special to rational animals.
This may seem flawed because it excludes young children mentally disabled adults from equal considerations are other humans. 
This objection is mistaken with regard to young children because it assumes young children are seperate entities from their adulthood selves.
Rather, children are usually just in an early stage of life of a creature who will have judgment-sensitive attitudes.
With regard to adults, we may be able to provide reason to give disabled adults equal weight as normal adults because of their species membership.
The idea is that our relation to human beings (and not other beings with similar characteristics) provides reason to believe our actions should be justifiable to them.
This has sometimes been characterized as speciesist.

A seperate question is the modality of creatures that contractualism is concerned.
Contractualism is not broad enough to cover all possible beings. This doesn't seem coherent.
But there's also no reason to think it only covers actual, living beings.
Contractualism does include future, current and past human beings.
Because these are human beings that constitute a perspective to which justifiability makes sense.
The degree to which we should be concerned with past and future beings is a substantive question.

## Conclusion
