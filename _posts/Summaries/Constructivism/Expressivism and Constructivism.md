# Expressivism and Constructivism

## What is Constructivism

There are at least four key features of constructivism

1. *Accessible*: Constructivism understands correct normative views of a relavant kind (political, ethical, normative) as those which are the upshot of a procedure or criterion. It disallows any possibility that rightness might consist in something mysterious and epistemically inaccessible to us.
2. *Irreducible*: The procedure or criterion is itself characterized in normative terms invoking ideals of e.g. rationality or reasonableness. Constructivism contrasts with reductionist views such as metaethically ambitious readings of naturalism.
3. *Construction*: The application of the procedure or criterion determines or constitutes correctness, rather than tracks a correctness conceived as prior to and independent of it.
4. *Practical*: The rationale for taking an interest in whatever the procedure or criterion delivers is to settle distinctively practical rather than theoretical problems.

## Psychology

Sharon Street defends what she calls metaethical constructivism, which she defines as:
The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A's other judgments about reasons.
The idea is familiar to reflective equilibrium.

But this seems circular. 
It seems we need to know what reasons are in order to know what judgments about reasons are.
This theory does mantain the attractions of philosophical naturalism (avoiding the metaphysical and epistemological mystification of non-naturalism) while avoiding an unappealing kind of naturalistic reductionism.

However, non-cognitivism also has these benefits.
It does this by characterizing certain mental states of normative commitment and then explaining what is conveyed by normative judgments in light of this characterization.
Street takes the distinctive character of normative judgments to be primitive, not open to further explanation.
However, expressivists will want to know whether this primitive state of mind is a beleif, desire or something else.

Street says that normative judgments differ from both beliefs and desires. 
They differ from beliefs in that they have a necessary connection to motivation that beliefs as such lack.
They differ from desires because they have certain constituitive constraints which are not applicable to desires.
E.g. the normative judgment that I have a reason to X constituitively involves judging that I have reason to Y where Y is some necessary means to X-ing. But desires have no constituitive involvement.

Firstly, it might be objected that this is not true; Stephen Finlay argues that desires constituitively involve desire to take the necessary means to its object.
Secondly, it could be objected that normative judgments and desires are not *the same*. 
Rather, normative judgments are a distinctive subspecies of desire, broadly understood.
Street's view should be recast in expressivist terms:

REASON: to judge that consideration X is a reason to Y is to favor X guiding deliberation and action in furtherance of concerns, desires, and aims to which it speaks in virtue of it and they being able to withstand scrutiny in the light of other reasons.

This view is now compatible with expressivism.

## Reflective Equilibrium

Another criticism is that reflective equilibrium could never itself be the basis of a constructivist account of reasons generally.
Reflective equilibrium cannot itself supply the basis for a constructivist account of that subject matter because the process of following the constructivist procedure cannot itself require "repeated judgments about the domain in question". 
The fact that a normative judgment "I have reason X to Y" is made in reflective equilibrium entails that I actually have reason X to Y only if the judgments made along the way to taht equilibrium are themselves sound.
But that fact cannot, without circularity, furnish the basis for a constructivist account of what such soundness consists in. 
While reflective equilibrium may be our best method for ascertaining our reasons, it cannot furnish us with a constructivist account of what a reason is.

Something like Street's view might be able to avoid the argument. 
Consider a characterization of the concept of RED: 
x is red iff x's appearing red survives the scrutiny of some appropriate normative discipline.
The *appearance* of redness enters as raw input states.
It is only through the application of disciplined scrutiny that they solidify into judgments.
E.g. appraising the stability of x's red appearance by checking against x's earlier/later appearance, appraising its commonality with the appearance from others, etc.
Street might say avoid Scanlon's objection by taking normative judgments as inputs into reflective scrutiny as raw feelings, e.g. what Michael Ridge calls *primitive normative judgments*.

But this is not promising.
Firstly, this does not seem phenomenologically plausible.
Secondly, it is difficult to see how dispositions of these raw feelings can be structured into a "web of judgments". That seems possible only for genuine judgments which bear conception and epistemic relations to other judgments.
It is more promising to conceive of normative judgments as desires, broadly understood.
The applicability of norms of stability, commonality, coherence, consistency, etc. to passions in our souls can intelligibly construct truth-apt judgments with some forms of objectivity (if the quasi-realist project suceeds).

Combining constructivism with expressivism uses expressivism to describe the semantic and metaphysical concerns of metaethics.
Constructivism explains what is distinctive about normative judgments, as opposed to desires generally. 
REASON takes normative judgments to be desires which are constituitively responsible to a standard of coherence in light of other normative judgments.
Such normative judgments must be governed by a weak, modest norm of the unification of agency.
Evaluating judgments with respect to other judgments is possibly only if we have some trust in the authority of other judgments, e.g. there is a degree of stablity between my deliberating reflective self now and at earlier times.
Normative questions are addressed to disinctively practical as opposed to theoretical problems.
More specifically, normative thought is addressed toward practical *conflict*.
We have desires which pull in opposing directions. 
This conflict is resolved by reflection which guides us towards coherence.

In order to be engaging in normative activity, one needs to aim at unifying one's agency. 
Further, one needs at least a minimal level of de facto unification, i.e. some minimal degree of diachronic stability of normative response and judgment.
These requirements are very minimal, and so REASON can be considered a formal (rather than substantive) constructivist account of reasons.

## Morality

A theory of MORALITY might be:

MORALITY: To call a consideration X a moral reason in favor of someone's Y-ing is to favor X guiding our deliberation and action in furtherance of concerns, desires, and aims to which it speaks in virtue of the fact that we might all, insofar as we are reasonable, agree in endorsing it and them as able to withstand scrutiny in the light of our other reasons.

This embodies a particular view of moral epistemology that regards moral inquiry as the pursuit of the kinds of normative commonalities needed to make life together as a well functioning moral community possible for us.
It emphasizes what we can justify *to others*.
Often, it might be said that moral theorizing is responsible to intuition in the way that scientific theorizing is to empirical observation.
Rather, MORALITY says that moral theorizing is responsible to the judgments of everyone with whom we share a social world and seek to live in a normative community.
