### Educational Attainment

The probability of graduating high school: White 84%, Black 73%
Fix to 103 IQ (average of HS graduate): White 93%, Black 91%

The probability of holding a bachelor's degree: White 27%, Black 11%
Fix to 114 IQ (average of Bachelor degree holders): White 50%, Black 68%

### Occupational Status

The probability of being in a high-IQ occupation: White 5%, Black 3%
Fix to IQ of 117 (average of high-IQ occupations): White 10%, Black 26%

### Wages

Annual wages for a year-round worker, 1989 (year-round, full-time worker): White $27,372, Black $20,994 
Fix to 100 IQ: White $25,546, Black $25,001 

The average black who worked yearround was making less than 77 percent of the wage of the average employed white. After controlling for IQ, the average black made 98 percent of the white wage. For Latinos, the ratio after controlling for IQ was also 98 percent of the white wage. 

Black Wages as a Percentage of White Wages, 1989 (year-round, full-time worker): 77%
Control for Age: 80%
Control for Age and Education: 82%
Control for Age and Education and Parental SES: 86%
Control for Age and IQ: 98%
Control for Age, IQ and Gender: 101%

Another way to summarize the outcome is that 91 percent of the raw black-white differential in wages and 90 percent of the raw Latino-white differential disappear after controlling for IQ.
