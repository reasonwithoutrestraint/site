Quantifying heritability and common misconceptions concerning heritability

1. Problems: (1) They are typically used for a restricted range of elite environments. Heritability depends on population. Cannot be extrapolated to different environments. And (2) often, twins raised apart are in the same town, sometimes even by relatives
2. Don't indicate how much genetics cause a trait (e.g. see weight)
3. Says nothing about between-group heritability
4. Says nothing about how they are influenced by environmental changes (e.g. see Dyslexia, weight, height)
