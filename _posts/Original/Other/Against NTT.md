Vegan argument:

name the traits of animals that justify killing them, which, if true of humans, would justify eating humans.

## Intellectual Capacity/Potential response

A certain capacity/potential for intelligence is required to have the right not to be killed. 
Note that this does not concern the right to not be tortured.
The specifics are not important. It might be the capacity for higher order thinking, thoughts about thoughts, IQ score, etc. 
The justification is not important. Maybe some libertarian Kantian principle, or some rule-utilitarian principle based on suffering, etc.
What's important is that any being with no hope of attaining the intellectual capacity of a human of a certain age (~2 years) has no right to life.
It may be the capacity to feel distress at the knowledge that society has accepted principles allowing one's death.

### Moral permissibility =/= Complete acceptability

They may bring up things we seem to feel bad about. E.g. killing mentally disabled, etc.
But we can explain feeling bad about these without saying its morally wrong.
E.g. We are disgusted with animated child porn, raping/eating brain-dead humans, etc. even though its not inherently morally bad.
These things have a gross factor and may justify making them unacceptable.

If they insist is that saying there's a gross factor == a moral judgment, then concede and say you have a polyaxiomatic system.

### Absurdity Response

Respond by claiming that all single axiom moral systems are absurd. 
The reason for the absurdity is that people have conflicting moral judgments and intuitions.
So absurdity cannot be evidence against a moral system because it is a trait of all moral systems.
If they revert to polyaxiomatic system, see below.

## Polyaxiomatic Response

Ask Yourself purports to hold a polyaxiomatic moral system, one that values both well-being and deontological rules. 
This is to avoid reaching any absurds conclusions that would result from adopting other axiom individually. 
Use a similar moral system to defeat NTT.

Adopt a moral system with the following components. A being has the right to not be killed if it has any of the following properties:
1. Is human.
2. Is valued by humans (e.g. pets, endangered species, etc.).
3. Is of a high enough intellectual capacity/potential (e.g. apes, aliens, etc.), i.e. high enough that the animal would feel distress knowing that we accepted a principle allowing their slaughter.

Now, you are defended from the absurdity rebuttals. 
The typically absurdity rebuttal from vegans is to allege that your principles would permit killing creatures that we do care about (e.g. mentally deficient humans, intelligent aliens, etc.). This is the force of the objection. 
But they cannot make such an argument. 
Now, they can only allege that your principles would permit killing non-human, non-valued, non-intelligent creatures (i.e. typicaly farm animals). 
But this objection has no force, because this is the very thing up for debate!

## My Actual Position

Not sure yet.
I probably only care about the intellectual capacity/potential, i.e. the sufferring that a being would recieve as a result of us accepting a principle that allowed their slaughter.
