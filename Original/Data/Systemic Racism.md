Blacks chance of being killed by the police comparable to their chance of killing police

If you have police play highly realistic virtual reality games in which they confront violent criminals they pause before shooting someone who is clearly coming after them. This pause is longer when their attacker is Black.

Perhaps they are afraid of the media turning their act of self-defense into a news story. This would explain why research has found that police are more likely to shoot Black people when they are using a body camera.

----- Drug usage ------

Against the notion that there must be racial bias because Blacks are more likely to be arrested for drug possession despite allegedly equal chance of using drugs.

The present study also identified predictors of discrepancies between self-report and hair testing. Race was the most salient predictor of cocaine disagreement. Even when other factors were controlled for, the self-report and hair test results for African Americans were more discrepant than for non-African Americans, a finding consistent with past studies (Fendrich, et al., 1999; Feucht, Stephens, & Walker, 1994). In a large study of youth (9−20), underreporting of cocaine was documented with urine testing validation as well (Fendrich & Yanchun, 1994) where African Americans in comparison to Caucasians who were urine positive were about 6 times less likely to report cocaine use when other factors are controlled for. Our study extends this finding to a middle-aged sample of male African American Vietnam veterans and non-veteran community controls. However, African American underreporting may well be a function of the particular sample and not ethnicity. One study of arrestees (Lu et al., 2001) reported African Americans are more likely to admit using crack cocaine than arrestees of other races. A prior study of veterans recruited through the VA system found no race differences in reporting discrepancies (Calhoun et al., 2000). Further studies are needed to elucidate sources of discrepancy to improve reporting pattern of cocaine.

A recent study of arrest data show that African Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession offences than Whites,even though general prevalence estimates show that they are no more likely to be using. The current study investigates the purchase patterns ofmarijuana users from the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to evaluate whether differences in purchasing behaviors existacross racial groups. Although in general people who purchase marijuana are more likely to buy in private settings and from someone they know,this analysis shows that African Americans are statistically more likely to engage in risky purchasing behaviors that increase their likelihood ofarrest. Using trivariate probit regression with demographic, drug use, and drug market covariates, analyses reveal that African Americans are nearlytwice as likely to buy outdoors (0.31 versus 0.14), three times more likely to buy from a stranger (0.30 versus 0.09), and signiﬁcantly more likely tobuy away from their homes (0.61 versus 0.48). These results provide an additional explanation for the differential in arrest rates between AfricanAmericans and Whites.

a report issued by the Justice Department found that Black drug users use drugs more often than White drug users, use more dangerous drugs than White drug users, and are more likely to use drugs in areas with high crime rates

----- Unfair Sentencing -----

This was the finding of Beaver et al. 2013. In this study, researchers compared criminal’s sentencing time after controlling for their verbal IQ and their self reported history of violence. They found that holding these variables constant completely eliminated the racial cap in sentencing.
