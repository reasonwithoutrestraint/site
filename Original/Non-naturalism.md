# Metaphysical Non-naturalist Objections

### Evolution

There is no evolutionary benefit to developing a psychological capacity to perceive non-natural properties, as the only perceptions that are beneficial are perceptions of natural properties, as natural facts are the only sorts of facts that would be evolutionary advantageous.

### Ontological Parsimony

Theories with fewer assumptions and better explanatory power are superior. Imagine a world without any non-natural properties but with all the same natural properties. These two worlds would have equal explanatory power, but the world without unneeded properties would have less assumptions and would therefore be superior. The reason is because non-natural properties must be causally inert.

### Lack of Episteic Access

Non-naturalism cannot explain how we have a faculty that detects non-natural moral facts. The difference between empirical perception and moral perception (of non-natural facts) is this: there is an intimate *causal relationship* between empirical perception and empirical facts; empirical facts *cause* can cause our perceptions, which explains how we can *detect* empirical facts. Therefore, our empirical perceptions serve as a good evidence of the empirical facts. However, there is no such intimate *causal relationship* between moral perception and non-natural moral "facts"; no non-natural moral fact can ever *cause* our perceptions (as they can't cause any natural phenomenon), which means they cannot explain how we *detect* moral facts. Therefore, we have no way of establishing good evidence of moral facts.

### Moral Supervenience

How can the normative supervene on the non-normative, if the normative are non-natural and the non-normative are natural. This can be explained by naturalism: the normative supervenes on the non-normative because both sets of properties just as natural properties.

It seems to be an a priori conceptual truth that moral properties supervene on the non-moral properties, i.e. two circumstances which have identical non-moral properties must also have identical moral properties. This can be easily explained by naturalism, but it is difficult to see how this is explained by non-naturalism. Non-naturalism purports that we perceive the non-natural moral facts as we perceive certain natural facts. But there is nothing about this perceptual model that *necessarily guarantees* that we will perceive the same moral facts in circumstances where we perceive the same natural facts (any perceived supervenience would be, at best, a posteriori). Thus, the perceptual model of non-naturalism cannot explain the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral. (it seems like the non-naturalist can easily reply that the moral facts are necessary and therefore supervene on the natural facts).

When we see an action that we judge to be wrong, we don't just judge it to be wrong in that particular circumstance. We judge that a particular action with certain natural properties always coinstantiates normative properties (i.e. we judge suffering and we judge badness, where the badness supervenes on the suffering). But this supervenience relation couldn't be perceived, for have only perceived the one circumstance, so how can we make a universal judgment about certain normative properties necessarily supervening on certain natural properties? The best explanation for judging necessary supervenience relation is that normative judgments are not perceptions of non-natural properties, but perceptions of natural properties, constructions of thinking, or non-cognitive expressions or prescriptions.

### Motivation

(new OQA) Non-naturalism fails to account for the motivational feature of normative judgments for the very same reasons that naturalism fails. The fact that moral properties move from the natural realm to the non-natural realm does not increase the motivational weight. Attributions of goodness to P appear to have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any non-naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are necessarily action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only contingently action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.
