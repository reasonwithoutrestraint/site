### Metaphysical Queerness

### Lack of Epistemic Access

Non-naturalism cannot explain how we have a faculty that detects non-natural moral facts. The difference between empirical perception and moral perception (of non-natural facts) is this: there is an intimate *causal relationship* between empirical perception and empirical facts; empirical facts *cause* can cause our perceptions, which explains how we can *detect* empirical facts. Therefore, our empirical perceptions serve as a good evidence of the empirical facts. However, there is no such intimate *causal relationship* between moral perception and non-natural moral "facts"; no non-natural moral fact can ever *cause* our perceptions (as they can't cause any natural phenomenon), which means they cannot explain how we *detect* moral facts. Therefore, we have no way of establishing good evidence of moral facts.

### Moral Supervenience

It seems to be an a priori conceptual truth that moral properties supervene on the non-moral properties, i.e. two circumstances which have identical non-moral properties must also have identical moral properties. This can be easily explained by naturalism, but it is difficult to see how this is explained by non-naturalism. Non-naturalism purports that we perceive the non-natural moral facts as we perceive certain natural facts. But there is nothing about this perceptual model that *necessarily guarantees* that we will perceive the same moral facts in circumstances where we perceive the same natural facts (any perceived supervenience would be, at best, a posteriori). Thus, the perceptual model of non-naturalism cannot explain the supervenience of the moral on the non-moral. (it seems like the non-naturalist can easily reply that the moral facts are necessary and therefore supervene on the natural facts).

### Motivation

Non-naturalism fails to account for the motivational feature of normative judgments for the very same reasons that naturalism fails. The fact that moral properties move from the natural realm to the non-natural realm does not increase the motivational weight. Attributions of goodness to P appear to have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any non-naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are necessarily action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only contingently action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent.
