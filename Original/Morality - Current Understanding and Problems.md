## Metaethics

### Normative Meaning

Criteria:

1. Must allow for disagreement.
2. Disagreement must be possible after agreement of all empirical facts.
3. Must explain the action-guiding and attitude-guiding character of it, i.e. people who genuinely believe they ought to X are generally disposed to do X.
4. Cannot be too strictly tied to conventions of the English language. Must be able to account for normative behavior in all human cultures.

#### Linguistic Analysis

Normative expressions are sometimes used non-cognitively - i.e. sometimes expressively, emotively, as imperatives, etc. But they can also be used cognitively. An agent who uses a normative term non-cognitively will also believe the cognitive component of that term.

Cognitivism: The assertion "P" (where P is a proposition) is accepted as cognitive; an agent *believes* P. It also seems that "P is credible" is a belief; an agent *believes* that P is credible. This seems to be the case. That is, it seems that "we have reason to believe P" is a cognitive expression. If so, then it should also follow that "P is good" is a cognitive expression. "P is good" can be formulated as "we have reason to promote/desire P". But if "we have reason to believe P" is cognitive, then it seems that "we have reason to promote/desire P" is also cognitive. In both cases, the speaker is asserting that we have reason to have certain response; the only difference is the particular response that we have reason to have, but this is a difference in content rather than form. Thus, it should not detract from its cognitive status.

#### Formal conceptualization

A normative system can be understood by the following components:
- T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.).
- R - The responses for following or violating the rules.
- C - The considerations that serve as reasons for the norm.
Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
- S - The actual norms of the normative system.
		
A set of norms S(N) is normative for behaviors of type T(N) (actions generally, beliefs, driving, etc.). It regulates those behaviors (provides oughts for those behaviors), usually on the basis of considerations C(N). 

Some normative systems are conventional: moral norms, legal norms, etiquette norms, health norms. For example: you morally ought not kill, if a norm in a society, means = [killing] will invoke [feelings of shame] when performed
	
Some normative systems are not conventional: The best example is rational norms, etc. You [rationally ought] to take the means to fulfill your ends, you [rationally ought] to believe the conclusion of a valid argument if you believe its premises. Other examples include conventional norms idealized: idealized legal norms, idealized etiquette norms, idealized moral norms. You [ideal legally ought] not drive above a certain speed limit. You [ideal morally ought] not have abortion.
	
Some normative systems are optional: moral norms, legal norms, health norms. Only rational norms are necessarily rationally mandatory. You [rationally ought] to do what you [(ideal or actual) legally ought] depending on the contingent overlap of rational and (ideal or actual) legal norms. The same applies to (ideal or actual) moral norms. You [rationally ought] to do what you [ideal legally/morally ought] to do only insofar as you endorse the function of those normative systems.

The considerations regarding rational ought claims (i.e. promotion of interests) different from the considerations regarding moral ought claims (e.g. harm, treatment as mere means, etc.) which differ from considerations regarding ettiquette (e.g. rudeness, offensiveness). Though some might dismiss this if they think rationality and morality converge, and/or morality and ettiquette converge.

#### Possible accounts of normativity

Normative Reasons are tied in some way to explanatory reasons. Normative reasons are considerations that ought to be explanatory reasons. Ought implies can. Therefore, it must be possible for normative reasons to be explanatory reasons. For each normative reason...that normative reason could explain their action if they did the action for that reason. That is, we can make sense of the statement "he did X because he had normative reason to do X". But this explanation works only if normative reasons can also explain behavior. Thus, we can say that A ought to do X if and only if X is appropriately connected to A's explanatory basis. What does "appropriately connected" mean?

- *Ideal Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if an ideal form of A, A', would X (or A' would want A to X). What are the conditions for this ideal form?
- *Informed Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if A would do X if A were informed of the reasons underlying X (doesn't seem true; plenty of people are aware of the reasons to believe in Climate Change, yet they still refuse. The problem is they know the considerations (which happen to be reasons) but they don't accept them AS reasons).
- *Reflected Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if A would X upon rational reflection (doesn't explain how animals have reasons; will have to appeal to "ideal counterfactual" to account for animals)

Another option is to say that there need be no connection to explanatory basis:

- *Constitution*: What it is to X is to be committed to Y. Thus, one ought to X if and only if Y is true (e.g. one ought to fear P if and only if P is dangerous, since that is what it means to fear P; this doesn't work for belief. We can't say one ought believe P if and only if P is true).

### Morality
		
#### Moral analysis
		
If the following conditions are met, then morality is pointless:
1. All relevant parties are fully informed/rational.
2. All relevant parties have non-conflicting interests.

If this occurs, then there is no point in morality, since everyone would agree. Morality is concerned only when people disagree, so either (1) or (2) must be false. So morality is concerned with when we are obligated/preferred to (not) perform actions that other agents have not explicitly agreed/consented to. Thus, morality is distinguished from rationality generally in that it has some social component. Some possibilities:

1. Morality is social rationality - what actions would be rational when considering as equals the interests of all affected parties.
2. Morality is a system for administering blame/guilt. X is morally wrong = it is rational to blame one for doing X and it is rational to feel guilty for doing X.
3. Morality is a system of justifying ourselves to others.

#### Possible accounts of morality

Non-forceful morality: this seems like a weaker form of morality, contingent upon the particular interests, desires, proclivities of the subjects in question. This would be morality as a system for administrering blame/guilt. Since these rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent), then morality itself is relative and contingent. This tells us when shame/blame is justified. This may depend on particular traditions of particular cultures.

Force: The following concerns when an action is prohibited, preferred, obligatory or permissible given that A has not explicitly agreed/consented to the action. This seems like a stronger form of morality, not contingent on particular interests of desires. This would be a system for applying force. This does not depend on the nature of our emotions. This tells us when physical force is justified. Justified in this sense is not merely in reference to feelings of blame/guilt either. What do I mean when I say force is morally justified/unjustified? I'm not sure, but it's not just that certain emotions are appropriate, since I think whether force is justified/unjustified is independent of the nature of our emotions. This is objective and universal across all rational beings.

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:
- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.).
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)
