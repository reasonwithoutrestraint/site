## Metaethics

### Normative Meaning

Criteria:

1. Must allow for disagreement.
2. Disagreement must be possible after agreement of all empirical facts.
3. Must explain the action-guiding and attitude-guiding character of it, i.e. people who genuinely believe they ought to X are generally disposed to do X.
4. Cannot be too strictly tied to conventions of the English language. Must be able to account for normative behavior in all human cultures.

#### Linguistic Analysis

Normative expressions are sometimes used non-cognitively - i.e. sometimes expressively, emotively, as imperatives, etc. But they can also be used cognitively. An agent who uses a normative term non-cognitively will also believe the cognitive component of that term.

Cognitivism: The assertion "P" (where P is a proposition) is accepted as cognitive; an agent *believes* P. It also seems that "P is credible" is a belief; an agent *believes* that P is credible. This seems to be the case. That is, it seems that "we have reason to believe P" is a cognitive expression. If so, then it should also follow that "P is good" is a cognitive expression. "P is good" can be formulated as "we have reason to promote/desire P". But if "we have reason to believe P" is cognitive, then it seems that "we have reason to promote/desire P" is also cognitive. In both cases, the speaker is asserting that we have reason to have certain response; the only difference is the particular response that we have reason to have, but this is a difference in content rather than form. Thus, it should not detract from its cognitive status.

#### Formal conceptualization

A normative system can be understood by the following components:
- T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.).
- R - The responses for following or violating the rules.
- C - The considerations that serve as reasons for the norm.
Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
- S - The actual norms of the normative system.
		
A set of norms S(N) is normative for behaviors of type T(N) (actions generally, beliefs, driving, etc.). It regulates those behaviors (provides oughts for those behaviors), usually on the basis of considerations C(N). 

Some normative systems are conventional: moral norms, legal norms, etiquette norms, health norms. For example: you morally ought not kill, if a norm in a society, means = [killing] will invoke [feelings of shame] when performed
	
Some normative systems are not conventional: The best example is rational norms, etc. You [rationally ought] to take the means to fulfill your ends, you [rationally ought] to believe the conclusion of a valid argument if you believe its premises. Other examples include conventional norms idealized: idealized legal norms, idealized etiquette norms, idealized moral norms. You [ideal legally ought] not drive above a certain speed limit. You [ideal morally ought] not have abortion.
	
Some normative systems are optional: moral norms, legal norms, health norms. Only rational norms are necessarily rationally mandatory. You [rationally ought] to do what you [(ideal or actual) legally ought] depending on the contingent overlap of rational and (ideal or actual) legal norms. The same applies to (ideal or actual) moral norms. You [rationally ought] to do what you [ideal legally/morally ought] to do only insofar as you endorse the function of those normative systems.

The considerations regarding rational ought claims (i.e. promotion of interests) different from the considerations regarding moral ought claims (e.g. harm, treatment as mere means, etc.) which differ from considerations regarding ettiquette (e.g. rudeness, offensiveness). Though some might dismiss this if they think rationality and morality converge, and/or morality and ettiquette converge.

#### Possible accounts of normativity

Normative Reasons are tied in some way to explanatory reasons. Normative reasons are considerations that ought to be explanatory reasons. Ought implies can. Therefore, it must be possible for normative reasons to be explanatory reasons. For each normative reason...that normative reason could explain their action if they did the action for that reason. That is, we can make sense of the statement "he did X because he had normative reason to do X". But this explanation works only if normative reasons can also explain behavior. Thus, we can say that A ought to do X if and only if X is appropriately connected to A's explanatory basis. What does "appropriately connected" mean?

- *Ideal Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if an ideal form of A, A', would X (or A' would want A to X). What are the conditions for this ideal form?
- *Informed Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if A would do X if A were informed of the reasons underlying X (doesn't seem true; plenty of people are aware of the reasons to believe in Climate Change, yet they still refuse. The problem is they know the considerations (which happen to be reasons) but they don't accept them AS reasons).
- *Reflected Counterfactual*: A ought to X if and only if A would X upon rational reflection (doesn't explain how animals have reasons; will have to appeal to "ideal counterfactual" to account for animals)

Another option is to say that there need be no connection to explanatory basis:

- *Constitution*: What it is to X is to be committed to Y. Thus, one ought to X if and only if Y is true (e.g. one ought to fear P if and only if P is dangerous, since that is what it means to fear P; this doesn't work for belief. We can't say one ought believe P if and only if P is true).

### Morality
		
If the following conditions are met, then morality is pointless:
1. All relevant parties are fully informed/rational.
2. All relevant parties have non-conflicting interests.

If this occurs, then there is no point in morality, since everyone would agree. Morality is concerned only when people disagree, so either (1) or (2) must be false. So morality is concerned with when we are obligated/preferred to (not) perform actions that other agents have not explicitly agreed/consented to. Thus, morality is distinguished from rationality generally in that it has some social component. Some possibilities:

1. Morality is a system of norms promotingg social rationality - what actions would be rational when considering as equals the interests of all affected parties.
2. Morality is a system of norms administering blame/guilt. X is morally wrong = it is rational to blame one for doing X and it is rational to feel guilty for doing X.
3. Morality is a system of norms justifying ourselves to others.
4. Morality is a system of norms that we would all agree to under certain conditions (similar to veil of ignorance)

Each of these are probably illuminating features of morality. They are each referring to distinct realms of evaluations that can be coherently called "morality". Thus, morality doesn't have one distinct meaning, but multiple. 

## Normative Ethics

#### Possible accounts of morality

[Bridge the gap between analysis of morality and an account of morality, somehow]

Aesthetic morality: this is a system for evaluating actions generally. The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise (warrant referring to whether we ought - no in the consequentialist senes - to blame/praise). Since the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent), then this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). This may be relative to particular conventions of particular species, cultures or even individuals. I don't think this morality isn't useful or meaningful, but it sits somewhere between ettiquette and objective morality below, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette.

Justice morality: this is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as optional morality. The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). This is objective and universal across all rational beings, even those lacking our particular emotions of blame/praise. So a group of rational beings may have no basis for morality in the aesthetic sense, yet they would have it in this justice sense. This is closer to contractualism, I think. This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority, I think.

[Ettiquette (aesthetics)] <----> [Optional Morality (aesthetics; justifies praise/blame)] <----> [Forceful Morality (justifies law & force)]

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:
- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.).
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)

## Political Philosophy

### Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	
- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	
- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 

equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources. 
	
- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	
- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.

Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	
- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.

Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	
- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	
- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.

Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 

- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.

Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	
- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	
- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

### My Theory

[Bridging the gap between forceful morality and property rights]

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property) as indicated above. Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

I'm not sure what these "special circumstances" consist in, but one trivial example where such force can be exerted is this: when A is intoxicated or when is uninformed. Perhaps the circumstance is this: whenever A's values/interests commits himself to be controlled by others in a certain situation. The reason this allows for force is because people can be wrong about their values/interests and therefore force (rather than, say, reason) may be the only way to promote their values/interests.

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 
1. rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others actually attempt to, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. It is necessary but not sufficient that others be unable to use/appropriate an equal share. It must also be shown that such individuals actually attempted to get such a share. If they never tried to use/appropriate such a share to begin with, then they are owed nothing, since their interests/values were never limited in promotion of someone else's.
2. some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which: (a) people are free to exit the community, (b) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and (c) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the lives of others. Note that this communal property probably isn't justified on any self-ownership principle; rather, it's justified because such property may be necessary for promotion of certain peoples' values/interests. In fact, there are levels to the extent that property is communal vs. private:
	- The larger the scope of a region that's communally owned, the more communal it is and the less private it is. Communal properties that are mostly private (e.g. small neighborhoods) can enforce larger constraints on behavior than larger communal properties that are mostly communal (e.g. cities). The reason smaller communities are afforded by restrictions is because conditions (a), (b) and (c) are more likely to be met. Smaller, more restricting communities, may be required to pay into a federal fund that that acts to sustain areas of the land where only libertarian laws are enforced, so that (a) and (b) are truly satisfied. Insofar as one cannot escape such a community (or if all available property is used up), compensation is obligatory for individuals (in the form of safety net, welfare, redistribution, etc.). 
	- Rather than thinking of (a) private property and (b) communal property in this binary fashion, it may be more useful to think of all property on a scale that goes from private to communal. The more private the property is, the stronger the full ownership rights will be. The more communal the property is, the weaker the rights will be. Note that nothing is fully private, not even a person's body (since I have shown that one's body may sometimes be controlled by others if it promotes the agent's values/interests). The extent to which property is private versus communal (i.e. the nature/strength of the ownership rights of that property) depends on the extent to which ownership of said property influences the values/interests of others. The more impactful ownership of certain property is to certain people (e.g. the only lake in the country), the more communal that property ought to be, among those people. The less impactful ownership of that property is to certain people (e.g. one of many empty plots of land in the city), the more property that property ought to be. Handling use of communal property should be done via a mechanism that best promotes the values/interests of the subjects involved, giving more weight to individuals influenced more by the property.
