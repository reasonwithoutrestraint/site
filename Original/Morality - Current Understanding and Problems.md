### Normative Meaning

Criteria:

1. Must allow for disagreement.
2. Disagreement must be possible after agreement of all empirical facts.
3. Must explain the action-guiding character of it, i.e. people who genuinely believe they ought to X are generally disposed to do X.

#### Linguistic Analysis

Normative expressions are sometimes used non-cognitively - i.e. sometimes expressively, emotively, as imperatives, etc. But they can also be used cognitively.An agent who uses a normative term non-cognitively will also believe the cognitive component of that term.

Cognitivism: The assertion "P" (where P is a proposition) is accepted as cognitive; an agent *believes* P. It also seems that "P is credible" is a belief; an agent *believes* that P is credible. This seems to be the case. That is, it seems that "we have reason to believe P" is a cognitive expression. If so, then it should also follow that "P is good" is a cognitive expression. "P is good" can be formulated as "we have reason to promote/desire P". But if "we have reason to believe P" is cognitive, then it seems that "we have reason to promote/desire P" is also cognitive. In both cases, the speaker is asserting that we have reason to have certain response; the only difference is the particular response that we have reason to have, but this is a difference in content rather than form. Thus, it should not detract from its cognitive status.
	
	> There is some conceptual tie to explanatory reasons.
	
	[ELABORATION] (intuitive?) Conceptual tie to explanatory reasons. Normative Reasons are tied in some way to explanatory reasons. You might say:
		(a) normative reasons are considerations that ought to be explanatory reasons. 
		(b) all normative reasons are such that, for each normative reason...that explanatory reason could explain their action if they did the action for that reason. That is, we can make sense of the statement "he did X because he had normative reason to do X". But this explanation works only if normative reasons can also explain behavior. (is this true? Is the requirement only that we need to make sense of the statement "he did X because he believe he had normative reason to do X" rather than "he did X because he had normative reason to do X").
		(c) if one sincerely judges that they have normative reason P, they must be moved to perform P.

#### Formal conceptualization

A normative system can be understood by the following components:
		T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.).
		R - The considerations that can serve as reasons for certain rules.
		P - The responses for following or violating the rules.
	Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
		S - The actual norms of the normative system.
		
	A set of norms S(N) is normative for behaviors of type T(N) (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.). It regulates those behaviors (provides oughts for those behaviors) on the basis of a specific reasons R(N). 

	Some normative systems are conventional: moral norms, legal norms, etiquette norms, health norms. You [morally ought] not kill, you [legally ought] not drive above a speed limit, etc. 
	
	Some normative systems are not conventional: 
		> The best example is rational norms, etc. You [rationally ought] to take the means to fulfill your ends, you [rationally ought] to believe the conclusion of a valid argument if you believe its premises.
		> Other examples include conventional norms idealized: legal norms, idealized etiquette norms, idealized moral norms. You [ideal legally ought] not drive above a speed limit. You [ideal morally ought] not have abortion.
	
	Some normative systems are optional: moral norms, legal norms, health norms. Only rational norms are necessarily rationally mandatory. You [rationally ought] to do what you [(ideal or actual) legally ought] depending on the contingent overlap of rational and (ideal or actual) legal norms. The same applies to (ideal or actual) moral norms. You [rationally ought] to do what you [ideal legally/morally ought] to do only insofar as you endorse the function of those normative systems.

### Morality

	I'm committed to the following moral norms:
		
		If the following conditions are met, then morality is pointless:
			1. All relevant parties are fully informed/rational.
			2. All relevant parties have non-conflicting interests.

		If this occurs, then there is no point in morality, since everyone would agree. Morality is concerned only when people disagree, so either (1) or (2) must be false. So morality is concerned with when we are obligated/preferred to (not) perform actions that other agents have not explicitly agreed/consented to.
		
		The following concerns when an action is prohibited, preferred, obligatory or permissible given that A has not explicitly agreed/consented to the action.
		
		1. Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:
			> A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
			> A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
				* A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
				* A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.).
			> A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests.
			> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to dimish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
				* A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
				* A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)
		2. Applying non-forceful action X to agent A is morally...
