## Summary

0. Normative Thinking
    - Some behaviors are independent of thought (involuntary actions)
    - Some behaviors are motivated by thoughts, call these motivational thoughts (undeliberate voluntary actions).
    - Some motivational thoughts are reformed via deliberation, call this deliberation normative reasoning (deliberate voluntary actions).  
1. Plattitudes of normativity: 
    - ubiquity
    - motivation - Debatable whether normative judgments necessarily motivate. Maybe not, but I'm only interested in normative judgments insofar as they are motivating.
    - reasoning 
    - disagreement 
    - supervenience 
2. Normative reduction: 
    - Relation between agents and behaviors.
    - Kinds of reasons: wrong kinds of reasons.
    - Nature of resaons: internalism vs externalism. 
3. Non-cognitive analysis: 
    - Emotive, expressive, prescriptive.
    - Non-cognitivist judgments are evolutionarily necessary.
    - Non-cognitivism can explain 99% of the normative judgments of humanity and other species.
    - Cognitive judgments cannot be necessarily motivating.
4. Cognitivist Non-descriptivist (Revisionist analysis): 
    - There are constraints on normative judgments that can be sufficient for "truth".
    - We may be capable of revising our normative discourse (e.g. see judgments of epistemic rationality).
    - Normative judgments can be rational/irrational which may be analogous to saying they are true truth, if not identical to truth. Judgments of rationality are siblings to judgments of truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld:
        - Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.
        - Certain normative judgments are better than others.
        - The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.
    - What makes truth-apt statements truth-apt?
    - Some constraints on normative judgments that make them quasi truth-apt
        - Follows a grammatical structure
        - Consistency
        - Coherence
        - Supervenience
        - What is missing for truth-aptness?
5. Nature of normativity:
    - Ideal dispositionalist / Constructivist
    - Kinds of reasons: right kinds and wrong kinds of reason
    - Quasi-Objectivism: All purported values of robust objectivity can be met:
        - Certain normative judgments are better than others.
        - Better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments (dependent on hypothetical judgments or constiuitive features of judgments).
6. Establishing meaning/plattiudes of different normative domains
    - morality
        - prudential reasons with an impartiality/social constriant
        - reasons for distinctively moral attitudes
        - norms generated from constructed relationships
7. Morality is rationally optional, but this doesn't diminish its authority
    - Contingent on our interests:
        - Nearly universal: most people interested in impartial/social reasons, having a system of norms regulating blame.
        - Emphasizes the negotiation aspect: people cant just have independent that they claim are objective with no consideration of other person's reasons.
        - Other analogues: Scientific reasons are impartial/social reasons for belief (and thus evidentially optional), but that doesn't diminish its authority.
    - Not externally necessarily justifiable, like all normative domains
        - Deduction/induction/abduction/evidence/science cannot be reasonable to someone who doesn't care for those forms of reasoning

Questions:
1. Requirements for cognitivism (language)
2. Requirements for descriptivism (mind)
3. Requirements for motivational/rational force (normativity)
4. Normative Reduction (language)

6. Non-external justifications of knowledge domains (epistemology)

## Metaethics

### Normativity

#### Normative Authority

`Importance/usage of normative jugdments`

As agents:
1. Ubiquity - We cannot rid ourselves of normative judgments.
2. Motivational - Our normative judgments influence our behavior.
3. Reasoning - Normative argumentation/reasoning influences our normative judgments.
4. Disagreement - We have genuine non-linguistic normative disagreements.
5. Supervenience - Apt normative predication supervenes on descriptive facts.

A theory of normative meaning must explain these.

A theory of normative truth will be non-deflationary (even if anti-realist/revisionary) for a particular normative domain so long as it provides interpersonal standards for (3) normative argumentation/reasoning. So long as there are solid interpersonal standards for normative argumentation/reasoning, it can be said that normative truth/warrant is whatever follows from those standards.

Showing these plattitudes:
1. See Korsgaard's work: animals believe what they perceive, and act based on their desires. Humans don't just take perceptions and desires at face-value; we reason and think about whether these perceptions/desires justify beliefs/actions. There is a cognitive, conscious process of normative reasoning standing between perceptions/desires and actions. This is normative reason. This doesn't necessarily commit me to saying that normative truth consists in what is entailed from this, but only that we all participate in normative reasoning. Normative truth might, e.g. consist in what is entailed from normative reason under proper conditions.
2. All synthetic judgments beliefs stem from normative reasoning, either deductive reasoning (e.g. for a priori judgments) or inductive reasoning (e.g. for a posteriori judgments). Not only is there the normative approval or deductive/inductive reasoning as a form of reasoning, but also the normative judgment that particular propositions follow from inductive reasoning. E.g. a person might think they accept inductive reasoning for non-normative reasons; fine, but it is still a normative question whether a particular belief inductively follows in any non-trivial set of experiences.

#### Normative Reduction

`How to systematize normative systems?`

--> Create structures that allow us to distinguish different normative domains.

--> Find what is common among all normative domains (i.e. a special relation)

Some tasks:
1. Find essential characteristics of normative judgments, i.e. are the judgments about properties or relations? If relations, concerning what objects?
2. Reduce all normative terms to one term or relation.
3. Find constrants on that relation, e.g. it must be guiding in some way, so it must be possilbe to met by the agent.
4. Determine how to distinguish different normative systems (e.g. epistemology, justice, morality, ettiquette, rationality, etc.).

The *cognitive* normative judgments all express proposition involving a *relation* on a triple consisting of an agent A, a partilcular response R, and a specified set of circumstances C. Whenever one makes a normative or evaluative claim they are saying that when A is in circumstances C, it is typical of (certain) actual people, typical of (certain) idealized persons or otherwise fitting for A to invoke R. Sometimes the agents are universal or individual, sometimes real or hypothetical. Sometimes the circumstances are categorical or specific. So normative judgments express propositions about *relations*, not *properties*.

A *cognitive* normative system can be understood by the following components:
- T - The types of behavior regulated (actions, beliefs, driving, etc.) - this constraints genuine normative statements to be action guiding in some way. Normative propositions that cannot be expressed in this manner are not coherent normative propositions.
- R - The considerations that serve as reasons for the norm. Different normative realms have different relavent considerations.
Then we can determine the content of the normative system:
- S - The actual norms of the normative system. These are entailed from whatever the relevant considerations are plus any observational content.
		
For a given normative system, there is a set of norms S(N) that regulates the behaviors of type T(N) on the basis of certain kinds of relevant considerations C(N). 

Examples:
- Rational norms regulate actions by advocating for whatever actions are entailed from *rational* considerations, i.e. whatever ends the agent is contigently committed to.
- Epistemic norms regulate beliefs by advocating for whatever beleifs are entailed from *epistemic* considerations, i.e. whatever perceptions, experiences, memories count in favor of.
- Ettiquette norms regulate actions by advocating for actions that are entailed from *ettiquette* considerations, i.e. a concern with pleasant engagements in a community
- Moral norms regulate actions by advocating for actions that are entailed from *moral* considerations, i.e. ??? . Or perhaps moral norms are not constuitive. Rather, these norms are emotive and are justified insofar as they prohibit actions that others have constituitive reason (moral reason, rational reason?) to shame/blame.

#### Normative Analysis

`Possible analysis of some normative judgments`

- Non-cognitive (pre-reflective normative judgments; not true or false; but can be justified - see below):
    - *Expressive*: When S says "A should X", S expresses a pro-attitude towards A doing X. "Yay to giving to charity!"
    - *Emotive*: When S says "A should X", S tries to persuade others to hold a pro-attitude towards A doing X.
    - *Imperative*: When S says "A should X", S issues a command for A to do X. "Give to charity!"
- Cognitive (post-reflective normative judgments; these can be true or false; and these can *justify* non-cognitive normative judgments):
    - *Dispositional*: When S says "X is P (for A)", S is saying that X tends to provoke a particular attitude (for A). Truth conditions depend on the agent(s). 
    - *Ideal Dispositional*: When S says "X is P (for A)", S is saying that X would provoke a particular attitude (for A) under idealized circumstances (full information, full rationality, sufficient reflection, etc.). Truth conditions depend on the idealized agent(s).
    - *Constituitive*: When S says "A should fear X", this is saying X is the way that "fear" characterizes it. Maybe similar remarks for blame, shame, etc. Truth conditions depend on the nature of the response.
    - *Constructivist*: When S says "A should X", S expresses a belief that S has reason to X on the basis of particular sorts of considerations, e.g. X is entailed by A's interests, X is entailed by considerations of morality, by considerations of ettiquette, etc. Truth conditions depend on the purpose of the constructed normative system.
    - *Non-natural*: When S says "A should X", this references a non-natural concept of "should" (or justification, appropriateness, etc.) that cannot be reduced to natural, non-normative terms. Truth conditions depend on some ontologically strange property/relation (that must be apprehended by some strange epistemic faculty like intuition). 

`Non-descriptive cognitivism`

Normative judgments are truth-apt, but not expressive of belief and are not descriptive. Ordinarily, we think that a judgment is true-apt if and only if it expresses a belief, and the truth or falsity of the judgment depends on whether the belief accurately represents reality. This would be a *correspondence* conception of truth which applies to descriptive judgments. But might there be other forms of truth?

Forms of truth:
- General: Judgment S expresses state of mind M. S is _ if and only if M is _. 
- Descriptive Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.
- Logical Judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constituitive of P1 are also constituiitive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.
- Modal Judgments:
- Probabilistic Judgments:
- Causal Judgments:

Normative Judgments
- Epistemic Normativity: 
- Prudential Normativity: 
- Moral Normativity: 

#### Normative Truth

`Prerequisites of an ontology of normative facts`

1. Must explain normative supervenience.
2. Must explain epistemic access.
3. Must explain rationality of normative facts.

Other considerations that deal with systematizing our normative concepts:
1. Particularism vs Generalism.
2. Reduction of normative judgments to a normative relation between agents and behaviors. 
3. Ought implies can. ||=> ought implies can and cannot. Not can or not cannot (or must or must not) implies not ought and not ought not.
4. Supervenience on the physical world.

#### Morality
		
`Distinctive features of morality`

Some features that might distinguish moral norms from other normative norms:
1. Moral norms = reasons for action with some interpersonal/social constraint (e.g. science = interpsonal reasons for belief).
    - Moral norms = individual practical reasons that everyone has.
    - Moral norms = reasons that follow after considering everyone's individual goodness equally.
    - Moral norms = norms no one could reasonably reject if they were motivated to find norms to regulate cooperation. Agent A can reasonably reject norm N if A's decreased individual goodness from N is more important than others' increased individual goodness.
2. Norms for the appropriateness of distinctively moral attitudes (e.g. blame, shame, guilt, praise, etc.).
    - Moral attitudes are generic evaluative attiudes expressing approval or disapproval.
    - Moral attitudes are particular evaluative attitudes with constituitive features.
        - Only directed at the features of an agent's character, not necessarily the effect of their actions.
        - A blames B if B's behavior impaired their relationship and A modifies his attitudes toward B. 
    - Moral attitudes are sanctions/rewards for modifying social behavior.
3. Norms for constructed kinds of relationships
    - To stand in a certain relation to someone (e.g. friend, lover, partner, cooperator, self-respecting individuals, etc.) has certain expectations for behavior by the parties involved. To the extent that someone violates these expectations, it is appropriate to not extend those behaviors to them, since they would now stand outside of the relationship. 
    - This might work for friends and ettiquette (i.e. to the extent that someone doesn't uphold the standards of good friendship, ettiquette, it is appropriate to not treat them as a friend, or with ettiquette). Maybe it also works for aesthetic morality. But maybe this doesn't work for forceful morality (maybe if someone is immoral, we still have moral obligations towards them, i.e. we can exclude them from society, but we cannot kill them).

Some analysis:

1. Morality is a system of norms administering blame/guilt. X is morally wrong = it is rational to blame one for doing X and it is rational to feel guilty for doing X.
2. Morality is a system of norms promoting social rationality - what actions would be rational when considering as equals the interests of all affected parties.
3. Morality properties are the natural facts that track and guide our use of moral concepts.
4. Morality consists in what is entailed from the constituitive features of morality
    - Morality is a system of norms that no one could rationally reject as a basis for unenforced, informed cooperation.
5. Moral truth consist in what an idealized otherwise normal agent would morally endorse. 
6. Morality follows from pure rationality
    - Valuing anything requires valuing the capacity to value.
    - There is no valid distinction to make between different individuals, metaphysical egoism is false.

Each of these are probably illuminating features of morality. They are each referring to distinct realms of evaluations that can be coherently called "morality". Thus, morality doesn't have one distinct meaning, but multiple. 

`Possibly multiple, distinct, valid analysis of morality`

Aesthetic morality: 
- This is a system for evaluating actions generally. 
- Judgments can be given either a constituitivist or dispositionalist analysis, found in all human cultures/societies.
- The actions are evaluated based on whether they warrant blame/praise. 
- On one reading, the rationality of these emotions depends on the nature of these emotions (which is relative and contingent). Thus, this morality itself is relative and contingent (similar to aesthetics, a la secondary qualities). Probably in line with the constituitivist analysis. This may be relative to contingent sensibilities.
- On another reading, these emotions have no constituitive meaning per se. They are mere tools to regulate society. As such, these emotions are warranted insofar as they promote the good of society (just as with individual rationality), i.e. positive states of consciousness, etc. The good of society should also be constrained in some way by consideration of the interests the agents who are issued duties, for it is assumed that all agents have reason to be moral.
- Sits somewhere between ettiquette and objective morality below, and is probably blurred in some way with ettiquette. 
- If a moral statement is true in this sense for a person, then they would be motivated to respect its law if they were informed/rational.

Justice morality: 
- This is a system for evaluating uses of force, but not on evaluating them in the same way as aesthetic morality.
- Judgments can be given a constructivist analysis, not necessarily found in all human cultures/societies.
- The evaluation here does not depend on the nature of our emotions. To say that force is (un)justified in this sense is not just to say that the force warrants blame/praise, since doing so depends on contingent nature of blame/praise. Indeed, there might be just uses of force that warrant blame, or unjust uses of force that warrant praise (depending on the nature of our emotions). 
- This is objective and universal across all rational beings, even those lacking our particular emotions of blame/praise, even those lacking consciousness or an experience of well-being. So a group of rational beings may have no basis for morality in the aesthetic sense, yet they would have it in this justice sense.
- This would also be the sort of action that grounds political authority. 
- Moral statements might be true in this sense, but a person need not have any motivation or even reason to respect its law in any particular circumstances (even if they were fully informed/rational). They would have a reason, rather, to support the construction of rules which society agrees to respect.

[Ettiquette (aesthetics)] <----> [Optional Morality (aesthetics; justifies praise/blame)] <----> [Forceful Morality (justifies law & force)]

Three types of norms regulating behavior:
1. Ettiquette - violations call for irritation
2. Morality - violations call for shame
3. Justice - violations call for force

Three types of reasons in favor of a norm:
1. Private consequentialist: Consequentialist reason to follow the norm; depends on personal interests that would be promoted by the individual following the norm. 
2. Private constituitive: Constituitive reason to follow the norm (i.g. "right" kind of reason); depends on personal, contingent sentiments, etc. a la secondary qualities. I think describes ettiquette, morality and aesthetics. If true reasons, people will be motivated to respect it in particular circumstances.
3. Public constructive: Reason to support societal construction of the norm; depends on desire to live in a certain sort of society with certain accepted rules. Can apply to people regardless of personal sentiments. I think describes forceful morality (i.e. justice, law) and possibly aeshtetic morality and ettiquette. People might not be motivated to respect it in any particular circumstance, but they will be motivated to support it as a rule that society agrees to respect.

On this understanding, we can still call animal cruelty wrong on the basis of aesthetic moral sentiments of normal humans. But could we be justified in using force to stop animal cruelty? Can aesthetic moral sentiments justify imposing force on others? Or can there be a constructive reason to enact norms to protect animal cruelty? In general, how can we support using force to stop the harm of individuals (animals or humans) outside of our social contract? This does afford the libertarian protective rights for people in society (as is desired), but it does not provide even minimum rights for people outside of society, i.e. it never justifies us to use force to stop them from being harmed.

## Substantive morality

#### Types of moral arguments

To argue that a particular act X is wrong/right in a particular circumstance C, there are a few possible arguments:
- Appeal to some fundamental principle that provides a determinate answer to the rightness/wrongness of X in circumstance C. See below for arguments in favor of fundamental principles. Of course, this is assuming that the fundamental moral principles form determinate answers, which need not be the case. This also assumes that there are fundamental moral principles, which need not be the case.
- Appeal to the obvious rightness/wrongness of an analogous act X' in an analogous circumstance C'. This theory can remain agnostic to the truth/weight of any fundamental moral principles (if any such principles even exist). This strategy is committed only to the fact that there clearly is a constraint on which *considerations* are morally relevant (regardless of whether and how those considerations can be reduced to certain principles). Considerations such as happiness, desires, autonomy, responsibility, etc. are potentially relevant moral considerations (i.e. humans clearly use these considerations in ordinary moral thinking; whether they really should be used and/or whether some of these are only instrumentally valuable is a further question). But there are clearly considerations that don't count as morally relevant. This style of argument works if it can be shown that the differences between C and C' are definitely not potentially relevant moral considerations.

To argue for certain fundamental principles:
- Reflective Equilibrium: Argue that these principles best explain, or cohere with, our considered moral judgments. The problem here is that the best principles that explain our moral judgments might not be nonconflicting, i.e. the considerations that explain our considered moral judgments might not reduce to the same principles (which means it might not provide determinate answers in all circumstances), and/or different people might have fundamentally different irreconcilable considered moral judgments.
- Foundational: Build these principles from the ground up, either from a metaethical theory, or pure rationality, or pure consistency, or from minimal constraints on any coherent moral theory. This may be too ambitious.

#### The Good

Possibilties for individual goodness:
- Narrow hedonism (sensory pleasure): states of consciousness marked by some distinctive feature
- Preference hedonism (attitudinal pleasure): preferred states of consciousness
- Unrestricted preference satisfaction: satisfaction of whatever preferences
- Success theory: satisfaction of preferences about one's own life, i.e. preferences about features that are introspectively discernable
- Objective list theory: knowledge, friendship, etc.
- Other constraints: S taking attitudinal pleasure in state of affairs P, only when S deserves that pleasure and P deserves to happen.

Collective Goodness:
- Summation over everyone's individual goodness.
- Average over everyone's individual goodness.
- No reducible metrics; only pareto optimal solutions.
- Distributions that would be preferred by everyone if they didn't know where they would fall within the distribution.
- Small diminishes to someone with high well-being for a large increase to someone with low well-being.

#### The Right - Fundamental moral principles 

`Fundamental moral principles`

Applying FORCEFUL action F to agent A is morally prohibited, unless:
- A explicitly consents (probably does not count as forceful, but I'll include it here for completeness).
- A implicitly consents, while informed/rational
	- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
	- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.).
- A is too ignorant/irrational to decide whether to have F done, and we believe that doing F promote's A's interests (maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible).
> A is causally responsible for a gap in wellfare between himself and others; F is permissible insofar as it is the only reasonable method to diminish this gap. IMPORTANT: this is not just a matter of saying all actions must maximize our interests equally; you can favor your own interets; the point is, you cannot be causally responsible for diminishing someone else's interests
	- A directly impedes the interests of others (e.g. theft, assault, etc.)
	- A indirectly impedes the interests of others (e.g. monopolizing an industry and charges high prices)

## Political Philosophy

#### Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

#### Variations of Libertarianism

From SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/

joint-ownership left-libertarianism (not lockean; not unilateralist): maximally strong version of a constraint on original appropriation. 
	
- A radical version holds that initially no one has any liberty right to use, or any moral power to appropriate, natural resources; individuals may use natural resources only with the collective consent (e.g., majority or unanimous) of the members of society.
	
- A less radical version holds that agents may use natural resources, but holds that they have no moral power to appropriate natural resources without the collective consent of the members of society (e.g., Grunebaum 1987). This leaves agents with  little security in their plans of action. They have the security that others are not permitted to use their person (e.g., assault them) without their consent, but they have only limited security in their possessions of external things (except with the consent of others). 

equal opportunity left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave enough for others to have an opportunity for well-being that is at least as good as the opportunity for well-being that one obtained in using or appropriating natural resources. 
	
- Individuals who leave less than this are required to pay the full competitive value of their excess share to those deprived of their fair share. Unlike the equal share view, those whose initial internal endowments provide less favorable effective opportunities for well-being are entitled to larger shares of natural resources. 
	
- Although this version of libertarianism is highly egalitarian, it limits the egalitarianism to the distribution of the value of the natural resources. Full self-ownership still places constraints on the promotion of equality: individuals are not morally required to provide personal services or body parts merely because they have more valuable personal endowments. This is what makes it libertarian.

Equal share left-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that one leave an equally valuable share of natural resources for others. 
	
- Individuals are morally free to use or appropriate natural resources, but those who use or appropriate more than their per capita share owe others compensation for their excess share.

Sufficientarian (centrist) libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that others be left an adequate share of natural resources (on some conception of adequacy). 
	
- There are different criteria that can be invoked for adequacy, but the most plausible ones are based on the quality of one's life prospects: enough for life prospects worth living, enough for basic subsistence life prospects, or enough for “minimally decent” life prospects. 
	
- Depending on the nature of the world and the conception of adequacy, the sufficientarian proviso may be more, or less, demanding than the Nozickean proviso. If natural resources are sufficiently abundant relative to the individuals, then the Nozickean proviso will be more demanding (since many individuals would get more than an adequate share without the use or appropriation), but if natural resources are sufficiently scarce, then the sufficientarian proviso will be more demanding than the Nozickean one.

Nozickean right-libertarianism (lockean, unilaterist): interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring that no individual be made worse off by the use or appropriation of a natural resource, compared with non-use or non-appropriation. 

- One might object that this sets the compensation payment too low. It bases compensation on each person's reservation price, which is the lowest payment that would leave the individual indifferent with non-use or non-appropriation. Use or appropriation of natural resources typically brings significant benefits even after providing such compensation. There is little reason, one might argue, to hold that those who first use or claim rights over a natural resource should reap all the excess benefits that those resources provide.

Radical right libertarianism (not lockean; unilateralist): holds that that there are no fair share constraints on use or appropriation. 
	
- Agents may appropriate, use, or even destroy whatever natural resources they want (as long as they violate no one's self-ownership). On this view, natural resources are initially not merely unprotected by a property rule (i.e., permissible use does not require anyone else's permission); they are also unprotected by a compensation liability rule (i.e., no compensation is owed if one uses). 
	
- One objection points out that appropriation without restrictions makes it possible that one person could own the entire world, thereby effectively putting the remaining propertyless persons in the problematic condition of requiring the owner's permission to do anything. Nor is there any reason to think the individuals are morally permitted to ruin natural resources as they please. Some sort of fair share condition restricts use and appropriation.

#### My Theory

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property) as indicated above. Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

I'm not sure what these "special circumstances" consist in, but one trivial example where such force can be exerted is this: when A is intoxicated or when is uninformed. Perhaps the circumstance is this: whenever A's values/interests commits himself to be controlled by others in a certain situation. The reason this allows for force is because people can be wrong about their values/interests and therefore force (rather than, say, reason) may be the only way to promote their values/interests.

Nevertheless, equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 
1. rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others actually attempt to, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. It is necessary but not sufficient that others be unable to use/appropriate an equal share. It must also be shown that such individuals actually attempted to get such a share. If they never tried to use/appropriate such a share to begin with, then they are owed nothing, since their interests/values were never limited in promotion of someone else's.
2. some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). Within these communities, the extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which: (a) people are free to exit the community, (b) there is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, and (c) the impact of these laws has significant effects on the lives of others. Note that this communal property probably isn't justified on any self-ownership principle; rather, it's justified because such property may be necessary for promotion of certain peoples' values/interests. In fact, there are levels to the extent that property is communal vs. private:
	- The larger the scope of a region that's communally owned, the more communal it is and the less private it is. Communal properties that are mostly private (e.g. small neighborhoods) can enforce larger constraints on behavior than larger communal properties that are mostly communal (e.g. cities). The reason smaller communities are afforded by restrictions is because conditions (a), (b) and (c) are more likely to be met. Smaller, more restricting communities, may be required to pay into a federal fund that that acts to sustain areas of the land where only libertarian laws are enforced, so that (a) and (b) are truly satisfied. Insofar as one cannot escape such a community (or if all available property is used up), compensation is obligatory for individuals (in the form of safety net, welfare, redistribution, etc.). 
	- Rather than thinking of (a) private property and (b) communal property in this binary fashion, it may be more useful to think of all property on a scale that goes from private to communal. The more private the property is, the stronger the full ownership rights will be. The more communal the property is, the weaker the rights will be. Note that nothing is fully private, not even a person's body (since I have shown that one's body may sometimes be controlled by others if it promotes the agent's values/interests). The extent to which property is private versus communal (i.e. the nature/strength of the ownership rights of that property) depends on the extent to which ownership of said property influences the values/interests of others. The more impactful ownership of certain property is to certain people (e.g. the only lake in the country), the more communal that property ought to be, among those people. The less impactful ownership of that property is to certain people (e.g. one of many empty plots of land in the city), the more property that property ought to be. Handling use of communal property should be done via a mechanism that best promotes the values/interests of the subjects involved, giving more weight to individuals influenced more by the property.
