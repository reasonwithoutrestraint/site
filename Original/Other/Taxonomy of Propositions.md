Relationship of Analytic, A Priori, Necessary:

- A Priori
    - Necessary
		- Tautological:
			- *Tautological*: "A triangle is a triangle".
		- Analytic
            - *Definitional*: "A triangle is a 3-sided polygon".
		- Synthetic
			- *Logical*: "A triangle's angles sum to 180 degrees".
	- Contingent
		- Analytic		 
			- *Contingent Rigid Designator*: "The meter stick is one meter"
		- Synthetic
			- *Subjective*: "Jane is thinking of X" (this will be a priori for Jane; a posteriori for others)

- A Posteriori
	- Synthetic 
		- Necessary
			- *Rigid Designator*: "Water is H2O".
		- Contingent
			- *Descriptive*: "Donald Trump is the president".

Rigid Designators: 
- "Water is H2O", "Colors are certain surface reflactance properties", "Temperature is the speed of molecules", etc. Perhaps moral terms are like this too if we take a *causal reference* theory of properties.
- Names get their meaning from (1) an original baptism. Where we point to some entity in the world and rigidly designate a label to refer to it. (2) The meaning is translated to others via definite descriptions. E.g. we might refer to the original baptism, or properties of the entity to refer to the entity in the future (e.g. water is a colorless liquid at room temperature).
- A claim is necessarily true if it is is logically necessary given the rigid designators of the concepts involved.
- Because all identity statements are true/false via rigid designators, they are all either necessarily true or false.
	- i.e. The rigid designators for "water" and "H2O" are identical. Thus, they are necessarily identical.
	- Logically necessary statements are also necessary
- Property attributions can be contingent or necessary.
	- They are necessary if the property ascribed can be logically deduced from the rigid designator.
- Contingent Rigid Designators: We create terms (e.g. "one meter") which both (1) rigidly designate a direct reference (e.g. the length one meter), and (2) designate the references that they do because of something contingent (e.g. the length of the meter stick at the time we created the term). 
- Rebuttal: the initial baptism does not have any more authority than other important definite descriptions.

Some distinctions

Ontological
- Non-obvious conceptual reductions - The concept "yellow" is the concept of having the surface reflectance properties to invoke the sensation of yellow in normal human observers.
- Non-conceptual property reductions - The property "yellow" *is* the property of reflecting light of wavelength XYZ.

Psychology
- Perceiving/feeling X and judging X - Perceiving X to be yellow (having a certain sensation) =/= Believing X to be yellow (believing that normal humans are disposed to have the sensation). 
- Holding attitude X and judging X to be reasonable. 
- Holding attitude X, judging X to be reasonable, and pondering whether its true that X is reasonable.
--> Differences:
- Perceptions/judgments are representation. Attitudes/judgments are not.
- Judging X to be reasonable influences whether one holds attitude X. Believing X need not influence one's perception that X.
--> Similarities
- The higher-level judgments are those that survive scrutiny under reflection/deliberation.
- The higher-level judgments systematize and make coherence of one's lower-level judgments.

Linguistic
- Explicit versus Implicit committments, e.g. what can be inferred from the *assertion* of a proposition rather than the *content* of the proposition.
