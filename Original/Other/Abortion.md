Objections to bodily autonomy arguments
1. Surely, not all violations of bodily autonomy are forbidden. E.g. we force individuals to call the police to help someone else. Pregnancies are usually safe and temporary, by contrast. There are some acceptable and some unacceptable intrusions of bodily autonomy. Why would forced pregnancy (after consensual sex) be an unacceptable violation? 
2. This doesn't account for responsibility. E.g. imagine a father comes home and beats their child in a fit of rage, which results in the child needing a temporary and usually safe blood transfusion from a donor. The only available donor is the father. The only person who has a blood match is the father. It seems that the father should be forced to undergo the blood transfusion.
3. This justifies infanticide or letting infants die. Imagine a mother no longer wants to care for her child, but there will be no one willing to care for this child for the next nine months. Assume further that the mother must breastfeed the child in order for him to live. On the bodily autonomy argment, the mother should be free to refuse to breastfeed this child, even if it results in the child's death (since no one else is willing to provide for him). This seems absurd, assuming the infant's circumstance is the result of voluntary decisions by the mother (e.g. imagine that the mother knew that there would be no one else who could care for him during this period).
4. This forbids parental child support.
5. This justifies late-term abortions. 
6. This justifies fetal abuse (this also applies to cases where the fetus is not a person).

## Pro-life argument

1. A fetus is a life
    - A. Arbitrariness argument
        1. The line drawn to designate when life begins must be non-arbitrary.
        2. The only non-arbitrary, non-repugnant line to draw for life before birth is conception.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Life begins at conception.
    - B. Potentiality argument
        1. If X has the potential to develop into a being of type T, then X should be afforded all the same rights afforded to beings of type T.
        2. Fetuses have potential develop into human life.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Fetuses have a right to life.
2. It is wrong to terminate a life
3. Abortion is wrong.

## Rebuttal

Rebuttal against 3:
- The pro-life argument works only if the fetus is understood as being a full life deserving of full rights to personhood. But if a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, then there are following two hugely unintuitive conclusions:
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the pregnancy is due to rape: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified in the case of rape. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just because they were victimized. E.g. I cannot kill you to account for a crime that someone else committed.
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the mother's life is at risk: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified when the mother's life is at risk. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just to save their life. E.g. I cannot kill you because I need a heart transplant.
- There are two options: 
    1. Bite the bullet and assert that abortion is unjutsified in the case of rape and danger to the mother.
    2. Admit that fetus don't really have full rights to personhood, but rather some weird form of pseudo-right to personhood. But what is the nature of the pseudo-rights and why should we believe that it encompasses protection of life only when the mother consented to pregnancy and/or is in danger. These are strange forms of rights not seen anywhere else. The only forms of rights either involve full rights to personhood (i.e. humans) or rights to not be subjected to pain but no rights to life (i.e. animals).

Rebuttal against 1A1:
- General cases: we can say the same about plenty of things - age when one should be able to consent, vote, work, smoke, drink, run for office, etc. Why the discrepancy?
- Abortion-specific case: assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. What non-arbitrary percentage of danger can you point to to say that the mother is justified in abortion? 

Rebuttal against 1B1:
- We don't think chlidren should have the right to vote, run for office, drive vehicles, consent to sex, etc. even though they have the *potential* to develop the capacities that would ordinarily generate these rights.
- Furthermore, what is meant by "potential"? Some children don't have the potential to develop these capacities. For example, let's say that we know the child will die before adulthood because of a genetic disorder.

Rebuttal against 2:
- Counter-examples: 
    - Killing in self-defense. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life. 
    - Killing with consent. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without consent.
    - Killing to put someone out of misery who can't consent. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without indication of consent or misery.
    - Killing someone who would have died at that moment: (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without indication of consent, misery, or probable future death.
- Blood transfusion case: people should not be forced to donate blood to others.
    - They respond by invoking responsibility. But, even if someone has put someone else's life in danger through their own voluntary actions, we don't force them to donate blood. Why the discrepancy?
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should force people to donate blood in these circumstances. Okay, but the impact of the responsibility is different. In the case of abortion, no being has their life deprived whereas in the case of the voluntary danger, someone's life has been deprived. The initial voluntary action X produces a responsibility to Y only if X without Y deprives the person of a life that they would have otherwise had.
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should be forced to donate blood to people when we put them in circumstances where they need blood, even if they would not have been alive anyway.
- Philosophical first principles: liberty

1. Terminating a life is wrong
2. (1) is blocked when the life is an unwanted parasite on a host.
3. (2) is blocked when the host is is responsible for the unwanted parasite
4. (3) is blocked when the host is responsible for the existence of the parasite


Notes:
- The deprivation argument has no independent force. It is not meant to show that you are permitted to harm anyone you bring into existence. That's absurd. E.g. giving a fetus FAS is also immoral.
- It has force only in a very narrow context if other principles are adopted. I.e. it removes the relevance of responsibility caused by voluntary behavior, specifically when the produced state of affairs is the creation of a new life.
- It is meant to show a conditional claim: IF it is permissible for the woman to abort due to rape THEN responsibility does not compel her to abort due to consensual sex. More generally: IF A is permitted to not sustain D because of bodily autonomy when they are not responsible for D's dependence THEN A is also permitted to not sustain D because of bodily autonomy when they ARE responsible for D's dependence if D would have never existed had A never performed the initial action that provided the responsibility.
- This does not allow the woman to give the fetus FAS because it is not permissible to give the fetus FAS even in the cases of rape. It does not allow parents to kill children because it is not permissible to kill children even in cases of rape. It might even allow that mothers can be compelled to raise and care for children assuming that we think mothers can be compelled to raise and care for children due to rape (perhaps we do?). 
- Do not try to justify the deprivation point by saying conception + death is no worse off than never conceiving, therefore abortion is permissible. This could justify all sorts of bad stuff. I.e. birth + premature murder is no worse off than never being born, therefore premature murder to one's offspring is permissible. The principle does not have wide scope. It's scope only shows that responsibility does not cancel bodily autonomy if it is responsibility for one's existence.

Objections:
- Mentioned in Boonin's paper - Langer, Tooley, etc.
- Future like ours objection
- "The Impairment Principle" argument:
    - If impairing an organism to the nth degree is immoral, then (all things else equal) impairing the organism to the nth+1 degree is also immoral.
    - Giving an infant FAS is immoral. Killing an infant causes more impairment than giving an infant FAS. Therefore, killing an infant is immoral.
    - Response: Giving an infant FAS in the case of rape is immoral. However, aborting an infant in the case of rape is not immoral. 
- Imagine a program is created which requests some stranger to donate their kidney to save someone. If you sign up, you have to stay signed up. This makes sense. Even though your intiial signing up did not deprive the victim of a previous state, it did deprive them of a life that they would have otherwise had (because otherwise someone else could have signed up).
- (4) is blocked when the fetus is made worse-off (e.g. you temporarily save someone who was about to die, which leaves them in excrutiating pain if you don't continue to help them). Conceiving and killing the fetus makes it worse-off. 
    - Is the fetus really made worse-off?

Those who reject Blood Transfusion:
    - If we are not permitted to unplug from blood transfusion, why are we permitted to stop someone from plugging us up?

Two main arguments:
    - If one is pro-choice in cases of rape, then one should be pro-choice in cases of non-rape
        - Responsibility is irrelevant when there is lack of deprivation
        - E.g. someone plugs into someone - saving their life - and then unplugs
        - One should be allowed to unplug. To deny this would be to deny that we should have the right to donate a finite amount of bodily tissue if doing so saves the victim's life temporarily
        - This particular argument would support late-term abortions
    - If one rejects forced organ donations, then one should be pro-choice in cases of rape
        - Possible disanalogies:
            - Parent vs stranger
            - Purpose of wombs
            - Disconnect vs dismembering / Killing vs let die 
        - Response
            - Imagine you wake up plugged into an adolescent stranger. You should be allowed to unplug
            - If so, then you should be allowed to unplug from your adolescent son whom you put up for adoption after birth
                - Genetic similarity doesn't produce a obligation
            - If so, then you should be allowed to unplug from your infant son due to rape
                - You never consented to be a parent, so you have no obligation to protect this child.
                - Genetic similarity alone doesn't produce an obligation
            - If so, then you should be allowed to perform abortions due to rape
                - The design of one's womb doesn't matter



Starting principles:
1. You should not be forced to connect to your child.
2. From (1), your child due to rape does not have a right to use your body.

Why abortions should be legal in cases of rape:
3. If your child does not have a right to use your body, then you have the right to disconnect
    - To deny this would be to de facto give your child the right to use your body.
    - Because e.g. once they have connected, you are not permitted to disconnect.
    - What good is a right to X if one is not permitted to exclude an intruder (innocent or otherwise).
4. From (2) and (3), You have the right to disconnect
5. From (4) You should be allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape.
    - Difference btewen (5) and (4): age and location of child.
    - Age does not matter
    - Location does not matter. Teleological arguments can be rejected.

Why abortions should be legal in cases of non-rape:
3. If you have the right to not connect, you have the right to connect and donate an insufficient amount of bodily tissue, even if this extends the child's life temporarily
    - Assuming this donation doesn't deprive the child of other goods (e.g. no one else would have donated bodily tissue otherwise)
    - Also assuming extending his life doesn't produce suffering in the child
4. From (1) and (3), You have the right to donate an insufficient amount of bodily tissue even if this extends the child's life temporarily
5. From (4), the fact that action X makes A responsible for B's depedennce on A's bodily tissue doesn't give B a right to A's bodily tissue if X combined with the lack of A's bodily tissue does not deprive B of a life that they would have otherwise had.
6. You should be allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape
7. From (5) and (6), you should be allowed to abort pregnancies due to consensual sex.
