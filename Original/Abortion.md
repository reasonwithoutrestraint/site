## Pro-life argument

1. A fetus is a life
    - A. Arbitrariness argument
        1. The line drawn to designate when life begins must be non-arbitrary.
        2. The only non-arbitrary, non-repugnant line to draw for life before birth is conception.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Life begins at conception.
    - B. Potentiality argument
        1. If X has the potential to develop into a being of type T, then X should be afforded all the same rights afforded to beings of type T.
        2. Fetuses have potential develop into human life.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Fetuses have a right to life.
2. It is wrong to terminate a life
3. Abortion is wrong.

## Rebuttal

Rebuttal against 3:
- The pro-life argument works only if the fetus is understood as being a full life deserving of full rights to personhood. But if a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, then there are following two hugely unintuitive conclusions:
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the pregnancy is due to rape: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified in the case of rape. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just because they were victimized. E.g. I cannot kill you to account for a crime that someone else committed.
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the mother's life is at risk: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified when the mother's life is at risk. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just to save their life. E.g. I cannot kill you because I need a heart transplant.
- There are two options: 
    1. bite the bullet and assert that abortion is unjutsified in the case of rape and danger to the mother.
    2. Admit that fetus don't really have full rights to personhood, but rather some weird form of pseudo-right to personhood. But what is the nature of the pseudo-rights and why should we believe that it encompasses protection of life only when the mother consented to pregnancy and/or is in danger. These are strange forms of rights not seen anywhere else. The only forms of rights either involve full rights to personhood (i.e. humans) or rights to not be subjected to pain but no rights to life (i.e. animals).

Rebuttal against 1A1:
- General cases: we can say the same about plenty of things - age when one should be able to consent, vote, work, smoke, drink, run for office, etc. Why the discrepancy?
- Abortion-specific case: assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. What non-arbitrary percentage of danger can you point to to say that the mother is justified in abortion? 

Rebuttal against 1B1:
- We don't think chlidren should have the right to vote, run for office, drive vehicles, consent to sex, etc. even though they have the *potential* to develop the capacities that would ordinarily generate these rights.
- Furthermore, what is meant by "potential"? Some children don't have the potential to develop these capacities. For example, let's say that we know the child will die before adulthood because of a genetic disorder.

Rebuttal against 2:
- Obvious cases: self-defense, killing criminals. It is okay to kill people who would otherwise perform dangerous actions that harm someone else. Note that merely being alive cannot count as a dangerous action. It might also be okay to kill a non-dangerous person who would have died anyway at that moment. It might also be okay to kill someone if they consent to being killed, or who probably would consent to being killed if they were capable of giving consent.
- Abortion-specific case: argue that *killing* is okay. This is assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. Why does her right to life trump the fetus's right to life? We don't think that's the case generally. You can't kill a non-dangerous (see above) person someone to save your life. Why the discrepancy? Either deny (1) that the fetus has life, or deny (2) that the women can kill the fetus to save her life, or deny (3) the law's position that one person cannot kill another life to save their life. If they deny (1), you win.
- Blood transfusion case: argue that *detaching* is okay. This is assuming that they maintain (1) that the fetus is a life. If they deny (2), that's just a huge blow to their position; but argue that (2) does not invalidate abortion, because abortion is about *detaching*. If they deny (3), don't convince them that *killing* is justified by a right to *life*, but that *detaching* is justified by a right to *bodily autonomy*. Invoke the analagous blood transfusion case (see above): we don't think people should be forced to donate blood to others.
    - They respond by invoking responsibility. But, even if someone has put someone else's life in danger through their own voluntary actions, we don't force them to donate blood. Why the discrepancy?
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should force people to donate blood in these circumstances. Okay, but the impact of the responsibility is different. In the case of abortion, no being has their life deprived whereas in the case of the voluntary danger, someone's life has been deprived.
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should be forced to donate blood to people when we put them in circumstances where they need blood, even if they would not have been alive anyway.
