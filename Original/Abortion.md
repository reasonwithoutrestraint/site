# Argument for Abortion

1. The only non-arbitrary line to draw for life before birth is conception.
2. Life begins before birth.
3. The line drawn must be non-arbitrary.
4. Abortion involves terminating a being after conception.
5. It should be illegal to terminate a life.
6. [from 1, 2 & 3] Life begins at conception.
7. [from 4 & 6] Abortion involves terminating a life.
8. [from 5 & 7] Abortion should be illegal.

Rebuttal against 3 (this doesn't work for people who don't use the arbitrariness objection to abortion, i.e. those who use the potentiality of life):
- General cases: we can say the same about plenty of things - age when one should be able to consent, vote, work, smoke, drink, run for office, etc. Why the discrepancy?
- Abortion-specific case: assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. What non-arbitrary percentage of danger can you point to to say that the mother is justified in abortion? 

Rebuttal against 5:
- Obvious cases: self-defense, killing criminals.
- Abortion-specific case: argue that *killing* is okay. This is assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. Why does her right to life trump the fetus's right to life? We don't think that's the case generally. You can't kill someone (unless in self-defense) to save your life. Why the discrepancy? Either deny (1) that the fetus has life, or deny (2) that the women can kill the fetus to save her life, or deny (3) the law's position that one person cannot kill another life to save their life. If they deny (1), you win.
- Blood transfusion case: argue that *detaching* is okay. This is assuming that they maintain (1) that the fetus is a life. If they deny (2), that's just a huge blow to their position; but argue that (2) does not invalidate abortion, because abortion is about *detaching*. If they deny (3), don't convince them that *killing* is justified by a right to *life*, but that *detaching* is justified by a right to *bodily autonomy*. Invoke the analagous blood transfusion case (see above): we don't think people should be forced to donate blood to others.
    - They respond by invoking responsibility. But, even if someone has put someone else's life in danger through their own voluntary actions, we don't force them to donate blood. Why the discrepancy?
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should force people to donate blood in these circumstances. Okay, but the impact of the responsibility is different. In the case of abortion, no being has their life deprived whereas in the case of the voluntary danger, someone's life has been deprived.
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should be forced to donate blood to people when we put them in circumstances where they need blood, even if they would not have been alive anyway.
