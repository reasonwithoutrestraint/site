## Pro-life argument

1. A fetus is a life
    - A. Arbitrariness argument
        1. The line drawn to designate when life begins must be non-arbitrary.
        2. The only non-arbitrary, non-repugnant line to draw for life before birth is conception.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Life begins at conception.
    - B. Potentiality argument
        1. If X has the potential to develop into a being of type T, then X should be afforded all the same rights afforded to beings of type T.
        2. Fetuses have potential develop into human life.
        3. [from 1 & 2] Fetuses have a right to life.
2. It is wrong to terminate a life
3. Abortion is wrong.

## Rebuttal

Rebuttal against 3:
- The pro-life argument works only if the fetus is understood as being a full life deserving of full rights to personhood. But if a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, then there are following two hugely unintuitive conclusions:
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the pregnancy is due to rape: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified in the case of rape. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just because they were victimized. E.g. I cannot kill you to account for a crime that someone else committed.
    - Abortion would be unjustified even when the mother's life is at risk: One cannot accept (1) a fetus deserves full rights to personhood, and (2) abortion is justified when the mother's life is at risk. Because (1) implies the falsity of (2). In other circumstances, when a person has full rights to personhood, another person cannot revoke those rights just to save their life. E.g. I cannot kill you because I need a heart transplant.
- There are two options: 
    1. Bite the bullet and assert that abortion is unjutsified in the case of rape and danger to the mother.
    2. Admit that fetus don't really have full rights to personhood, but rather some weird form of pseudo-right to personhood. But what is the nature of the pseudo-rights and why should we believe that it encompasses protection of life only when the mother consented to pregnancy and/or is in danger. These are strange forms of rights not seen anywhere else. The only forms of rights either involve full rights to personhood (i.e. humans) or rights to not be subjected to pain but no rights to life (i.e. animals).

Rebuttal against 1A1:
- General cases: we can say the same about plenty of things - age when one should be able to consent, vote, work, smoke, drink, run for office, etc. Why the discrepancy?
- Abortion-specific case: assuming they believe that the mother can abort if her life is in danger. What non-arbitrary percentage of danger can you point to to say that the mother is justified in abortion? 

Rebuttal against 1B1:
- We don't think chlidren should have the right to vote, run for office, drive vehicles, consent to sex, etc. even though they have the *potential* to develop the capacities that would ordinarily generate these rights.
- Furthermore, what is meant by "potential"? Some children don't have the potential to develop these capacities. For example, let's say that we know the child will die before adulthood because of a genetic disorder.

Rebuttal against 2:
- Counter-examples: 
    - Killing in self-defense. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life. 
    - Killing with consent. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without consent.
    - Killing to put someone out of misery who can't consent. (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without indication of consent or misery.
    - Killing someone who would have died at that moment: (2) is modified to: it is wrong to terminate an innocent life without indication of consent, misery, or probable future death.
- Blood transfusion case: people should not be forced to donate blood to others.
    - They respond by invoking responsibility. But, even if someone has put someone else's life in danger through their own voluntary actions, we don't force them to donate blood. Why the discrepancy?
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should force people to donate blood in these circumstances. Okay, but the impact of the responsibility is different. In the case of abortion, no being has their life deprived whereas in the case of the voluntary danger, someone's life has been deprived.
    - They bite the bullet and say that we should be forced to donate blood to people when we put them in circumstances where they need blood, even if they would not have been alive anyway.
