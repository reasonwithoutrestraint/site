# Motivation 

## The Central Problem

1. Moral judgments are judgments of fact.
2. Moral facts are categorical, independent of contingent features (beliefs, desires, etc.)
3. Moral facts provide reasons
4. Reasons are motivating
5. Only contingent features are motivating 

## Key Divides

### Language: Cognitivism vs Non-cognitivism

Moral claims are truth-apt (applicable to normativity generally)

Non-cognitivism: moral are not truth apt

Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt

### Metaphysical: Objectivism vs Subjectivism (mind-independence)

Whether moral facts are independent of moral beliefs (actual or hypothetical).

Simple Subjectivism: moral facts depend on an agent's actual moral beliefs (subjectivism)

Sophisticated subjectivism: moral facts depend on hypothetical moral beliefs (ideal dispositionalism) (realism?)

Mind-independent objectivism: moral facts are independent of any actual/hypothetical moral beliefs (naturalism, non-naturalism, fitting attiude) (realism)

Mind-dependent objectivism: moral facts are constitutive features of practical reasoning (constructivism) (realism?)

### Universalism vs Relativism

Relativism: there are no moral norms applicable to all rational beings

Universalism: there are at least some moral norms applicable to all rational bings

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

Whether moral rules give us reason for action, whether they can motivate us to act, their authority.

## Platitudes for a semantics of moral language:

1. Morality is normative/motivating
2. Moral disagreement is possible 
3. Empirical agreement does not rule out moral disagreement.
