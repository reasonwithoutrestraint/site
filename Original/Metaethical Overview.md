# Problems 

### Semantic

Incompatible:
1. Moral judgments are truth-apt.
2. Truth-apt judgments must be beliefs (i.e. descriptive).
3. Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.
4. Beliefs are not sufficient for intrinsic motivation.

Rejections:
1. Rejected by non-cognitivists.
2. Rejected by cognitivist non-descriptivists (non-cognitivst with minimal truth theories, pragmatists, constructivists).
3. Rejected by morality-motivation externalists.
4. Rejected by non-Humean theories of motivation.

### Metaphysical

Incompatible:
1. Moral truths provide duties independent of any agent's contingent desires.
2. Moral truths provide duties necessary practical reasons (perhaps even overriding).
3. Practical reasons are necessarily dependent on desires.
4. There are no necessary desires in all rational agents
5. There are moral truths.

Rejections (among truth-apt positions): 
1. Rejected by subjectivists.
2. Rejected by morality-reasons externalists.
3. Rejected by non-Humean theories of rationality.
4. Rejected by metaphysical egoists.
5. Rejected by error-theorists.

# Overview

### Plattitudes

Normative Thinking:
- Some behaviors are independent of thought (involuntary actions)
- Some behaviors are motivated by thoughts, call these motivational thoughts (undeliberate voluntary actions).
- Some motivational thoughts are reformed via deliberation, call this deliberation normative reasoning (deliberate voluntary actions).  

Essential Normative Plattitudes: 
- Ubiquity - All rational creatures invoke normative judgments.
- Motivation - To invoke a normative judgment favoring X is to express a motivational tendency to X. To the extent that somehow fails to do what they judge to have most reason to do, they are acting irrationally.
- Reasoning - Normative judgments can be modified/improved via reasoning and argumentation.
- Disagreement - People genuinely disagree about normative judgments.

Controversial Normative Platitudes:
- Truth-aptness
- Descriptive
- Objective
- Non-reductive

Moral Plattitudes
- Moral facts necessarily apply to all rational agents.
- Moral facts provide reason for action.
- Moral facts supervene on the descriptive facts.
- Moral facts differ from practical reasons generally (i.e. they call for blame, shame).

# Key Divides

The Road to Moral Realism

The latter one rejects on the road, the more problems they face accommodating external (non-moral) requirements.

The earlier one rejects, the more problems they face accommodating internal (moral) pretensions

Multidisciplinary issues that cause external accommodation issues as one goes toward realism 
- Language: What it takes for a statement to be truth-apt?
- Mind: What state characterizes belief? Desire? Other states?
- Metaphysics: What explains supervenience, reduction, grounding, etc.
- Normativity: What it takes for something to be a reason? To be motivating?
- Metaphilosophy: What is required for an analysis? Uninformative? Can there be revisionist analysis?

### Semantic & Phenomenological: Cognitivism & Descriptivism

Are normative statements truth-apt? 

Are they descriptive (i.e. beliefs)? Do they describe entities, properties or relations?

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are neither truth-apt nor descriptive
    - Components:
        - Semantic: Robust conception of truth (usually)
    - Varieties: 
        - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
        - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
        - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
    - Cons:
        - Semantic: Embedding problem
        - Phenomenology: Moral attitude problem
        - Violates pretension of normative discourse
2. Non-descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt, but not descriptive
    - Components:
        - A minimalist conception of what is necessary for truth-aptness.
        - A sentence is truth-apt if they are conditions when it can be asserted.
        - There are conditions when it can be asserted based on the grammatical rules of the language,
    - Pros:
        - Other non-descriptive truth-apt linguistic domains: modality, probability, causation.
    - Con:
        - Semantic: Problem of creeping minimalism
        - Phenomenology: moral attitude problem
        - Violates pretension of normative discourse
3. Descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt and describe moral entities, relations or properties.
    - Components:
        - Semantic: Robust conception of truth
    - Cons:
        - Semantic: Open-Question argument 
        - Motivation: Cannot explain intrinsic motivation
        - Phenomenology: Normative judgments are world to mind fit, rather than mind to world fit
        - Flexibility of language: A ought to X, A needs to X, A must X, X is crappy, X is disgusting, etc. can all mean the same thing. Best explained as prescriptions and/or expressions, rather than reports/descriptions.
        - Cognitivism is evolutionarily useless. 
        - Arguments often apply to sentences that are clearly non-cognitive.

### Metaphysics: Objectivism vs Subjectivism

The metaphysical relation between normative truth and normative judgments. Are the truth-condition of normative judgments attitude-independent?

(assuming descriptivism)
 
1. Subjectivism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are identical to some actual or hypothetical judgments.
    - Vareities:
        - Simple subjectivism: Normative facts are grounded in *actual* attitudes judgments.
        - Ideal subjectivism: Normative facts are grounded in the *hypothetical* attitudes of an *ideal* agent.
    - Cons:
        - Semantic: Open-Question Argument
        - Cannot account for disagreement.
        - Normative: Cannot explain categorical normative authority (if used to analyze morality directly).
        - Normative: Cannot analyze normativity generally (if analysis depends fully informed judgments, cannot explain epistemic normativity).
2. Objectivism: normative facts based on correspondence with normative facts, which are ontologically prior to, and can explain, normative judgments.
    - Cons: 
        - Motivation: Cannot explain intrinsic motivation
        - Normative: Cannot ground intrinsic rationality
        - Arguments often apply to judgments that are clearly objective.

Fourth option that no one accepts: normative facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Error-Theory vs Success-Theory

1. Error-Theory
    - Pros:
        - See cons for objectivism & naturalism/non-naturalism
    - Cons:
        - Arguments often apply to normativity generally, which cannot work.
2. Success Theory

### Metaphysics: Naturalism vs Non-naturalism:

Some ways to draw the naturalism - non-naturalism divide:
- Natural facts are reductive. Non-natural facts are not. (this conflates reductionism and naturalism)
- Natural facts must be discovered a posteriori. Non-natural facts can be discovered a priori.
- Natural facts have spatio-temporal properties. Non-natural facts do not.
- Natural facts have causal powers. Non-natural facts do not.

1. Naturalism:
    - General Cons:
        - Motivation: Cannot explain intrinsic motivation
        - Normative: Cannot ground intrinsic motivation
    - Cons against analytic reductionism:
        - Semantic: Open-Question argument
        - Semantic: Twin-Earth
        - Semantic: Translation
    - Cons against synthetic reductionism:
        - Semantic: Twin-Earth
        - Epistemology: Cannot explain a priori normative knowledge
        - Epistemology: No universally agreed properties of normative facts (unlike, e.g. water is H2O or yellow is wavelength ...). 
        - How it differs from non-naturalism?
    - Cons against Irreductionism.
        - How it differs from non-naturalism?
2. Non-naturalism: 
    - Cons:
        - Motivation: Cannot explain intrinsic motivation
        - Normative: Cannot ground intrinsic rationality (because of lack of motivation)
        - Ontology: Queer Supervenience
        - Ontology: Causal redundancy => ontological bloat
        - Ontology: Causal redundancy => evolutionarily useless
        - Epistemology: Causal redundancy => epistemic access
        - Epistemology: Supervenience detected as a conceptual necessity

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

Ways of addressing the normative status of morality, and the motivational status of normativity.

Normativity:
1. Normative judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Normative judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Normative judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

Moral Rationalism:
1. Moral facts must provide *necessary* practical reasons (apply to all rational agents necessarily).  
2. Moral facts must provide *necessarily overriding* practical reasons.

Moral Motivation:
1. Moral judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Moral judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Moral judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

# NON-COGNITIVISM

Planning

### Timmons

### Objection

# NON-DESCRIPTIVISM

Moral statements are truth-apt, but do not aim at describing or reporting moral facts, i.e. moral entities, properties or relations.

See "Creeping Minimalism" and "Four faces of moral realism" for more on non-descriptivism.

The truth-conditions are attitude-dependent. Very similar to simple subjectivism, except it denies that moral judgments are descriptive. They lies somewhere between reports and mere expression (as with non-cognitivism).

### Hilary Putnam - Pragmatism - _Ethics without Ontology_

### Sharon Street - Constructivism - Various Essays

### Korsgaard - Kantian Constructivism - _Sources of Normativity_

### John Rawls - "Kantian Constructivism"

1. Seems too dependent on us

# ERROR-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. But such facts do not exist. 

### J.L. Mackie - _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_

### Richard Joyce - _The Myth of Morality_

### Objection

1. Most objections to success-theories are equal problems for normativity broadly
2. If not (1), then the requirements for morality are too strong

# ANTI-REALISM SUCCESS-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. The moral facts are grounded in our current or hypothetical moral judgments.

## Relativism

### Gilbert Harman 

### Objection

## Subjectivism

### Roderick Firth - _Ideal Observer Theory_

### Michael Smith - Idealized Observer - _The Moral Problem_

### Objection

1. Open Question Argument
2. Too agent dependent (some theories)
    - Cannot account for disagreement
    - Seems to not justify normative authority
3. Cannot account for normativity generally, specifically epistemic rationality (some theories).
