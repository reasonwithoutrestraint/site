# Overview

1. Moral statements are truth-apt.
    - Accepted by cognitivists

2. Moral statements describe moral facts (moral entities, properties or relations).
    - Accepted by descriptivists
    - Rejected by non-descriptive cognitivism (constructivists, pragmatists, minimalist cognitivism)
3. Moral facts purport to be attitude independent
    - Accepted by robust cognitive realists
    - Rejected by subjectivists (ideal observer, simple subjectivism, corrected judgments)
4. Moral facts exist.
    - Accepted by success-theorists
    - Rejected by error-theorists
5. Moral facts are not natural facts.
    - Accepted by non-naturalists
    - Rejected by naturalists

# Key Divides

### Semantic: Cognitivism, Descriptivism

Are normative statements truth-apt and are they descriptive (express beliefs)?

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are neither truth apt nor descriptive
    - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
    - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
    - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
2. Non-descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt, but not descriptive
    - A minimalist conception of what is necessary for truth-aptness.
    - A sentence is truth-apt if they are conditions when it can be asserted.
    - They are conditions when it can be asserted based on the grammatical rules of the language,
3. Descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt and describe moral entities, relations or properties.
    - Naturalistism: moral entities are naturalistic.
    - Non-naturalistism: moral entities are not naturalistic.

### Metaphysics: Objective (attitude-independent) truth conditions

The metaphysical relation between normative truth and normative judgments:

1. Non-descriptive cognitivism: no moral facts
    - The relation is *entailment* from normativity itself (constructivism).
2. Descriptive Anti-Realism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are identical to some actual or hypothetical judgments.
    - Normative facts are grounded in *actual* normative judgments (simple subjectivism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in *hypothetical* judgments (normative or otherwise) of an *ideal* agent (ideal observer, sophisticated subjectivism).
3. Descriptive Realism: normative facts based on correspondence with normative facts, which are ontologically prior to, and can explain, normative judgments.
    - Normative facts are grounded in attidude-independent natural facts (naturalism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in non-natural facts (non-naturalism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in secondary properties (sensibility theory).

Fourth option that no one accepts: normative facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Metaphysics: Naturalism vs Non-naturalism:

Some ways to draw the naturalism - non-naturalism divide:
1. Natural facts must be discovered a posteriori. Non-natural facts can be discovered a priori.
2. Natural facts have spatio-temporal properties. Non-natural facts do not.
3. Natural facts have causal powers. Non-natural facts do not.

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

Ways of addressing the normative status of morality, and the motivational status of normativity.

Normativity:
1. Normative judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Normative judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Normative judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

Morality-reasons:
1. Moral facts must be *necessarily* rationally required, regardless of any agent's desires.

Morality-motivation:
1. Moral judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Moral judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Moral judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

# NON-COGNITIVISM

Moral statements are not truth-apt.

## Classical

### A.J Ayer - Expressivism

### C.L. Stevenson - Emotivism

### R.M. Hare - Universal Prescriptivism

### Objection - Frege-Geach Problem

## Modern

### Simon Blackburn - _How to be an Moral Antirealist_

### Simon Blackburn

### Allan Gibbard
Planning

### Timmons

### Objection

# NON-DESCRIPTIVISM

Moral statements are truth-apt, but do not aim at describing or reporting moral facts, i.e. moral entities, properties or relations.

See "Creeping Minimalism" and "Four faces of moral realism" for more on non-descriptivism.

## Assertoric Nondescriptivism

The truth-conditions are attitude-dependent. Very similar to simple subjectivism, except it denies that moral judgments are descriptive. They lies somewhere between reports and mere expression (as with non-cognitivism).

### Mark Timmons

### Objection

## Pragmatism

The truth-conditions are attitude-independent

### Hilary Putnam

### Objection

## Constructivism

The truth-conditions are attitude-independent

### Sharon Street - What is Constructivism?

### Korsgaard - Kantian Constructivism

### John Rawls - Kantian Constructivism

1. Seems too dependent on us

# ERROR-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. But such facts do not exist. 

### J.L. Mackie 

### Richard Joyce

### Objection

1. Most objections to success-theories are equal problems for normativity broadly
2. If not (1), then the requirements for morality are too strong

# ANTI-REALISM SUCCESS-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. The moral facts are grounded in our current or hypothetical moral judgments.

## Relativism

### Gilbert Harman 

### Objection

## Subjectivism

### Roderick Firth - _Ideal Observer Theory_

### Michael Smith - Idealized Observer

### David Hume - Idealized Observer

### Objection

### Objection

1. Open Question Argument
2. Too agent dependent (some theories)
    - Cannot account for disagreement
    - Seems to not justify normative authority
3. Cannot account for normativity generally, specifically epistemic rationality (some theories).

# REALISM

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. The moral facts are ontologically independent of our actual or hypothetical moral judgments. Further, moral facts can explain our moral judgments.

## Naturalism

### Anayltic Reductionist Naturalism

### Peter Railton - Synthetic Reductionist Naturalism - _Moral Realism_

### Richard Boyd - Irreducible Naturalism (Cornell Realism),  _How to be a Moral Realist_
