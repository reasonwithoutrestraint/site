# Motivation 

## The Central Problem

1. Moral judgments are judgments of fact.
2. Moral facts exist
3. Moral facts are categorically binding, independent of contingent motivations
4. Moral facts provide reasons
5. Only motivations provide reasons
6. There are no necessarily shared motivations among rational agents

## Key Divides

### Language: Cognitivism, Descriptivism

Are normative statements truth-apt and are they descriptive (express beliefs)?

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are neither truth apt nor descriptive
    - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
    - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
    - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
2. Non-descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt, but not descriptive
    - A minimalist conception of what is necessary for truth-aptness.
    - A sentence is truth-apt if they are conditions when it can be asserted.
    - They are conditions when it can be asserted based on the grammatical rules of the language,
3. Descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt and describe moral entities, relations or properties.
    - Naturalistic Beliefs: normative statements express beliefs that can be understood in natural terms:
    - Non-naturalistic Beliefs: normative statements express beliefs that cannot be understood in natural terms

### Metaphysics: Objective (attitude-independent) truth conditions

The metaphysical relation between normative truth and normative judgments:

1. Non-descriptive cognitivism: no moral facts
    - The relation is *entailment* from normativity itself (constructivism).
2. Descriptive Anti-Realism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are identical to some actual or hypothetical moral judgments (all naturalism).
    - Normative facts are *identity* to *actual* normative judgments (simple subjectivism).
    - Normative facts are *identity* to *hypothetical* normative judgments of an *ideal* agent (ideal observer, sophisticated subjectivism).
3. Descriptive Realism: normative facts based on correspondence with normative facts, which are ontologically prior to, and can explain, normative judgments.
    - Normative facts are *identical* to attidude-independent natural facts (naturalism).
    - Normative facts are *identical* to non-natural facts (non-naturalism).
    - Normative facts are *identical* to secondary properties (sensibility theory).

Third option that no one accepts: normative facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

1. Anti-Rationalism: morality does not necessarily provide reason for action
2. Rationalism: morality necessarily provides reason (though perhaps not overriding reason) for action
