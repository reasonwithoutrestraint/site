# Motivation 

## The Central Problem

1. Moral judgments are judgments of fact.
2. Moral facts exist
3. Moral facts are categorically binding, independent of contingent motivations
4. Moral facts provide reasons
5. Only motivations provide reasons
6. There are no necessarily shared motivations among rational agents

## Key Divides

### Language: Cognitivism vs Non-cognitivism

Are normative statements capable of truth and do they express beliefs.

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are not truth apt, nor expressions of belief
    - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
    - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
    - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
2. Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt
    - Naturalistic Beliefs: normative statements express beliefs that can be understood in non-normative terms:
        - Counterfactual beliefs: pure normative statements express beliefs about what an agent would do if they were ideal (i.e. fully rational, fully informed, consistent, reflective, etc.). For more substantive normative domains, either (1) there may be more substantive conditions baked in, or (2) they may be given a different analysis that refers back to this analysis of pure normative statements. For example, Railton's moral naturalism understands moral statements as statements about what promotes the normative goodness of all affected parties, giving each party equal consideration; this may or may not be equivalent to an analysis that understands moral statements as what a person would do if they were concerned with the normative goodness of all affected parties.   
    - Non-naturalistic Beliefs: normative statements express beliefs that cannot be understood in normative terms

### Ontology: Objective (mind-independent) truth conditions

The ontological relation between moral facts and moral views:

1. Anti-Realism: Moral facts are constituted by some relation to actual or hypothetical moral views (seems to require naturalism).
    - The relation is *identity* to the *actual* moral views of a person (simple subjectivism).
    - The relation is *identity* to the *hypothetical* moral views of an *ideal* agent (ideal observer).
    - The relation is *entailment* from one's moral views (constructivism).
2. Realism: Moral facts are ontologically prior to, and can explain, moral views (can be naturalism, non-naturalism or sensibility theory).
    - The moral facts are natural facts.
    - The moral facts are non-natural facts.
    - The moral facts are secondary properties.

Third option that no one accepts: moral facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

1. Anti-Rationalism: morality does not necessarily provide reason for action
2. Rationalism: morality necessarily provides reason (though perhaps not overriding reason) for action

## Platitudes for a semantics of moral language:

1. Morality is normative/motivating
2. Moral disagreement is possible 
3. Empirical agreement does not rule out moral disagreement.
