# Problems 

### Semantic

Incompatible:
1. Moral judgments are truth-apt.
2. Truth-apt judgments must be beliefs (i.e. descriptive).
3. Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating.
4. Beliefs are not sufficient for intrinsic motivation.

Rejections:
1. Rejected by non-cognitivists.
2. Rejected by cognitivist non-descriptivists (non-cognitivst with minimal truth theories, pragmatists, constructivists).
3. Rejected by morality-motivation externalists.
4. Rejected by non-Humean theories of motivation.

### Metaphysical

Incompatible:
1. Moral truths provide duties independent of any agent's contingent desires.
2. Moral truths provide duties necessary practical reasons (perhaps even overriding).

# Overview

### Plattitudes

Normative Thinking:
- Some behaviors are independent of thought (involuntary actions)
- Some behaviors are motivated by thoughts, call these motivational thoughts (undeliberate voluntary actions).
- Some motivational thoughts are reformed via deliberation, call this deliberation normative reasoning (deliberate voluntary actions).  

Essential Plattitudes: 
- Ubiquity
- Motivation
- Reasoning 
- Disagreement 
- Supervenience 

Alleged Substantive Platitudes:
- Truth-aptness
- Descriptive
- Objective
- Non-natural

### Road to Moral Realism

The latter one rejects on the road, the more problems they face accommodating external (non-moral) requirements.

The earlier one rejects, the more problems they face accommodating internal (moral) pretensions

1. Moral statements are truth-apt.
    - Accepted by cognitivists
    - Rejected by non-cognitivists (emotivists, prescriptivists, expressivists). Objections:
        - Moral attitude problem
        - Embedding problem
2. Moral statements describe moral facts (moral entities, properties or relations).
    - Accepted by descriptivists
    - Rejected by non-descriptive cognitivism (constructivists, pragmatists, minimalist cognitivism). Objections:
        - Problem of creeping minimalism
3. Moral facts purport to be attitude independent
    - Accepted by robust cognitive realists
    - Rejected by subjectivists (ideal observer, simple subjectivism, corrected judgments). Objections:
        - Cannot account for disagreement (simple subjectivism, corrected judgments).
        - Doesn't justify categorical normative authority.
        - Cannot account for normativity generally, particular epistemic normativity.
4. Moral facts exist.
    - Accepted by success-theorists
    - Rejected by error-theorists. Objections:
        - Cannot disprove normativity generally.
5. Moral facts are not natural facts.
    - Accepted by non-naturalists
    - Rejected by naturalists. Objections:
        - Open-Question argument
        - Motivationally inert
        - Rationally inert (unless all normativity is non-natural)
6. Moral facts are non-natural facts    
    - Objections:
        - Causal redundancy (ontological bloat, lack of epistemic access, evolutionarily wasteful)
        - Queer Supervenience
        - Motivationally inert
        - Rationally inert (unless all normativity is non-natural)

Multidisciplinary issues that cause external accommodation issues as one goes toward realism 
- Language: What it takes for a statement to be truth-apt?
- Mind: What state characterizes belief? Desire? Other states?
- Metaphysics: What explains supervenience, reduction, grounding, etc.
- Normativity: What it takes for something to be a reason? To be motivating?
- Metaphilosophy: What is required for an analysis? Uninformative? Can there be revisionist analysis?

# Key Divides

### Semantic: Cognitivism, Descriptivism

Are normative statements truth-apt and are they descriptive (express beliefs)?

1. Non-cognitivism: moral statements are neither truth apt nor descriptive
    - Expressivist: normative statements express a speaker's attitudes
    - Emotive: normative statements function to influence the attitudes of others
    - Prescriptive: normative statements are imperatives
2. Non-descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt, but not descriptive
    - A minimalist conception of what is necessary for truth-aptness.
    - A sentence is truth-apt if they are conditions when it can be asserted.
    - They are conditions when it can be asserted based on the grammatical rules of the language,
3. Descriptive Cognitivism: moral claims are truth-apt and describe moral entities, relations or properties.
    - Naturalistism: moral entities are naturalistic.
    - Non-naturalistism: moral entities are not naturalistic.

### Metaphysics: Objective (attitude-independent) truth conditions

The metaphysical relation between normative truth and normative judgments:

1. Non-descriptive cognitivism: no moral facts
    - The relation is *entailment* from normativity itself (constructivism).
2. Descriptive Anti-Realism: normative truth based on correspondence with normative facts, which are identical to some actual or hypothetical judgments.
    - Normative facts are grounded in *actual* normative judgments (simple subjectivism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in *hypothetical* judgments (normative or otherwise) of an *ideal* agent (ideal observer, sophisticated subjectivism).
3. Descriptive Realism: normative facts based on correspondence with normative facts, which are ontologically prior to, and can explain, normative judgments.
    - Normative facts are grounded in attidude-independent natural facts (naturalism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in non-natural facts (non-naturalism).
    - Normative facts are grounded in secondary properties (sensibility theory).

Fourth option that no one accepts: normative facts are ontologically prior to moral views, but cannot explain any moral views. In that case, we are not in causal contact with moral facts. Thus, we have no reason to believe in them.

### Metaphysics: Naturalism vs Non-naturalism:

Some ways to draw the naturalism - non-naturalism divide:
1. Natural facts are reductive. Non-natural facts are not. (this conflates reductionism and naturalism)
1. Natural facts must be discovered a posteriori. Non-natural facts can be discovered a priori.
2. Natural facts have spatio-temporal properties. Non-natural facts do not.
3. Natural facts have causal powers. Non-natural facts do not.

### Normativity: Categorical vs Hypothetical

Ways of addressing the normative status of morality, and the motivational status of normativity.

Normativity:
1. Normative judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Normative judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Normative judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

Moral Rationalism:
1. Moral facts must provide *necessary* practical reasons (apply to all rational agents necessarily).  
2. Moral facts must provide *necessarily overriding* practical reasons.

Moral Motivation:
1. Moral judgments must be *necessarily* motivational (though not always overriding)
2. Moral judgments must be *usually* motivational.
3. Moral judgments must be *intrinsically* motivational, *capable* of motivating without any (additional) desires.

# NON-COGNITIVISM

Moral statements are not truth-apt.

## Classical

### A.J Ayer - Expressivism

### C.L. Stevenson - Emotivism

### R.M. Hare - Universal Prescriptivism

### Objection - Frege-Geach Problem

## Modern

### Simon Blackburn - _Essays in Quasi-realism_

### Allan Gibbard - Plan-Expressivism - _Thinking How to Live_
Planning

### Timmons

### Objection

# NON-DESCRIPTIVISM

Moral statements are truth-apt, but do not aim at describing or reporting moral facts, i.e. moral entities, properties or relations.

See "Creeping Minimalism" and "Four faces of moral realism" for more on non-descriptivism.

The truth-conditions are attitude-dependent. Very similar to simple subjectivism, except it denies that moral judgments are descriptive. They lies somewhere between reports and mere expression (as with non-cognitivism).

### Hilary Putnam - Pragmatism - _Ethics without Ontology_

### Sharon Street - Constructivism - Various Essays

### Korsgaard - Kantian Constructivism - _Sources of Normativity_

### John Rawls - "Kantian Constructivism"

1. Seems too dependent on us

# ERROR-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. But such facts do not exist. 

### J.L. Mackie - _Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong_

### Richard Joyce - _The Myth of Morality_

### Objection

1. Most objections to success-theories are equal problems for normativity broadly
2. If not (1), then the requirements for morality are too strong

# ANTI-REALISM SUCCESS-THEORY

Moral statements are truth-apt and aim at describing moral facts. The moral facts are grounded in our current or hypothetical moral judgments.

## Relativism

### Gilbert Harman 

### Objection

## Subjectivism

### Roderick Firth - _Ideal Observer Theory_

### Michael Smith - Idealized Observer - _The Moral Problem_

### Objection

1. Open Question Argument
2. Too agent dependent (some theories)
    - Cannot account for disagreement
    - Seems to not justify normative authority
3. Cannot account for normativity generally, specifically epistemic rationality (some theories).
