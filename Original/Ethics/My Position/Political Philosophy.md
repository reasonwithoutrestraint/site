From Sep: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism
-  They hold, for example, that each person has a right to maximum equal negative liberty, which is understood as the absence of forcible interference from other agents (e.g., Narveson 1988; Steiner 1994; Narveson & Sterba 2010). This is sometimes called “Spencerian Libertarianism” (after Herbert Spencer).
- Most, however, focus more on the idea of self-ownership. Famously, this view is attributed to Robert Nozick (Cohen 1995; but see the discussion below).
- Full self-ownership might seem to condemn as wrongful even very minor infringements of the personal sphere, such as when tiny bits of pollution fall upon an unconsenting person...This objection, however, is of dubious force as it presupposes an (even more) implausible conception of full self-ownership than its defenders have reason to endorse. Suppose we understand the moral benefits that self-ownership confers along two dimensions: protections from unwanted uses of our bodies, and liberties to use our bodies. As the objection points out, it is not possible to simultaneously maximize the value of both dimensions: our protections restrict our liberties by restricting the possible uses of one’s body, and vice versa. Since maximizing the protection-dimension implausibly restricts the use-dimension, the correct response is not to reject self-ownership, but rather to loosen the protection-dimension somewhat in order to enhance the use-dimension. Doing this would allow minor infringements for the sake of self-ownership. As Eric Mack (2015) puts it, a good theory of self-ownership offers people some “elbow room.” (For more discussion, see Brennan & Van der Vossen 2017)
- Libertarian theory can thus be defended in many different ways [rather than taking self-ownership to be a self-evident foundational principle]. This is true both of theories that give pride of place to self-ownership and of theories that don’t. Examples of the former include Eric Mack (2002, 2010) who sees self-ownership rights as among several natural rights grounded in our nature as purposive beings. In Mack’s view, the protections and freedoms offered by the idea are justified in order to grant to all individuals a separate sphere in which they can act in accordance to their self-chosen purposes. Similarly, Loren Lomasky (1987) derives rights from a related, although slightly different, conception of people as project pursuers. John Tomasi (2012) argues that strong rights over our bodies are required by the ideal of democratic legitimacy. According to Daniel Russell (2018), self-ownership rights provide the only way that people who live together can all genuinely live their own lives.
- Some theorists depart from consequentialist or teleological principles, which they see as best served by these policies (Epstein 1995, 1998; Friedman 1962; Rasmussen & Den Uyl 2005; Shapiro 2007). Others adopt a Rawlsian framework, either claiming that the spirit of John Rawls’ theory of justice (particularly a concern for the least well off) calls for a far greater respect for individual freedom than is usually thought (Tomasi 2012). Yet others see classically liberal requirements flowing from a public reason or justificatory approach (Gaus 2010, 2012)

			==================================================================
										Formulation
			==================================================================

From Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka: "full self-ownership is a bundle of rights that is (roughly) equal to the logically strongest set of ownership rights that people can have over themselves compatible with others having equal such rights over themselves".
- This is not determinate for a few reasons:
	- Ownership consists of a protection dimension and a use dimension. Both cannot be maximized simultaneously. We must restrict one to increase the other. Full protection-rights (with no use-rights) results in paralysis. Full use-rights (with no protection-rights) results in anarchy. Both of these possibilities, and everywhere in between, is compatible with full self-ownership.
	- The use/protection balance appropriate for a type of ownership might vary depending on the property being owned (e.g. bodily rights emphasize protection rights more, whereas property rights emphasize use rights more). 
	- There can be communal ownership of some kinds of property. E.g. instead of A and B both owning 50% of resources each; A and B each *fully* own 25% of resources each (e.g. their bodies, resources that can be divided evenly without losing value. These emphasize protection-rights over use-rights), and each *communally* own the remaining 50% of resources (e.g. the air, public spaces, etc. these emphasize use-rights over protection-rights. Perhaps one is owed compensation when one uses too much).  

Justified uses of coercion:
- Consent: 
	- Explicit
	- Implicit
		- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
		- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
			- There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
			- Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
	- Revoked
		- E.g. to enforce contracts
- Impairment: 
	- Lack of rationality
	- Lack of information
	- Maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible
- Rectification: Compensation for constraints imposed
	- Past physical damages
	- Excess resource usage AND others attempt to access their fair share but are prevented
	- Mandated safety nets in societies where a person is worse-off due to the presence of a state or economic system.
	- Scope: worldwide
- Forced Compensation: taking someone's resources and compensating them, only if:
	- The portion taken is too small to cause large harm to the person's interests (e.g. in taxation)
	- The person is compensated for the transaction in the same resources
	- E.g. taxation to support welfare. If we didn't, we would have to pay for prisons, etc. Of course, this needs to be balanced against creating poor incentives for unfit reproduction.
- The preconditions for basic democracy don't require democratic support
	- Assuming they *did* have democratic support, we would still need these in place to know if they had democratic support.
	- The goal is to make sure everyone's interests are considered in the democracy. 
	- Examples
		- Voting Infrastructure
		- Courts
		- Education
			- Otherwise, people might not know they have the right to vote
			- They might not know what's good for them
			- They might be coerced non-violently by others 
- Protection against other constraints
	- Whether current or future (i.e. pre-emptive protection is justified).
	- This extends beyond mere requirements for a democratic society. It applies to constraints generally, even non-intentional and non-agential.
	- When considering whether to force A to assist B.
	- If A is causally responsible (either intentional or non-intentional, e.g. owning all water) for B's diminished liberty, the state is permitted to constrain A.
	- Otherwise, constraining A is permitted if:
		 - The cost to A is reasonable
		 - The burden alleviated from B is sigificant
		 - The only way to alleviate the constraint on B is by coercing A
		 - B is not responsible for his circumstances ?
	- Examples: 
		- Minarchism: police, military, courts, prison
		- Ambition-sensitive safety net: provide opportunity to food, healthcare, shelter, etc. The *ambition*-sensitive aspect is meant to create environments such that everyone can obtain food, healthcare, means for living, etc. *if* they have the appropriate intentions. This means providing the resources for children directly, and possibly for adults (for adults, it depends on the opportunities available in the economy).
- Arbitrary (non-economic) communal preferences
	- Doesn't have to be based on contracts, and there need be no causal responsibility.
	- A community's preferences can trump other members' preferences assuming:
		1. There is widespread support. 
		2. The harms to the coerced is not major.
		3. The harms to the coerced is comparable/less than the harm that would otherwise apply to the beneficiary.
		4. The imposed constraint is the only way to alleviate the other constraint.
		5. The decisions could not feasibly be made on a more local level.
	- Restrictive immigration is permitted in a community so long as:
		- The internal group shares what exceeds their fare share of resources (e.g. via trade, aid, etc.).
		- The internal group has democratically decided to not let them in.
		- What if members outside of the group are oppressed, subjugated, etc. and we have not used more than our share? We have a duty to let in many so long as the cost is not too high (e.g. it doesn't degrade standard of living, increase crime, etc.) and/or donate aid, trade, etc. until it imposes a high burden. 
		- If the cost is too high, citizens are permitted to not let them in and the state should not make us let them in, but they are permitted to enter (e.g. a homeless person is permitted to break in one's home, but the homeowner has no obligation to let them in, and the state should not force them).
- Unwanted Economic Externalities
	- Justification
		- These are justified due to their contractual nature. Contracts only get their validity from consensual support.
		- It doesn't need to be the only way to alleviate a constraint.
		- Nor does the alleviated constraint need to be major.
	- Requirements:
		- Most people in a region prefer the opportunities to form contracts with features X
		- Most people are incentivized such that their actions in the market make it impossible for contracts of feature X to succeed
		- Thus, people's choices in a free makert are not expressions of their preferred contract system
		- People can express their contract preferences via voting
		- Note that the competing harms here are identical, e.g. people being restricted due to the free market versus the voting system.
		- Not that this applies to deciding how contracts are formed, not necessarily other preferred systems (e.g. this doesn't apply to whether people prefer gay people to be around). Why contracts?
			- (1) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, then contracts of type not-X would be disincentenvized from existing.
			- (2) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, this would not be an unjust restriction on employees/employers who prefer contracts of type not-X. 
			- (3) Whether an employer/employee is restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of free market versus forces of the political system does not influence the *personal harm* that this places on those employees/employers. Harm here is measured in their opportunity to satisfy their preferences.
			- (4) Whether a political/economic system is just supervenes on the harm it places on people.
			- (5) [1 and 2] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to free market actions, then this would not be an unjust restrictions on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
			- (6) [3 and 4] Whether people are restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of the free market versus the political system is not relevant to whether they are treated justly.
			- (7) [5 and 6] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to a voting system, then this would not be an unjust restriction on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
		- This does not work for things like wanting there to be no gay people because the 2nd permise wouldn't pass through. E.g. if everyone in a free makret acted to incentivize killing gay people, this WOULD be an unjust restriction on gay people.
	- Example: workplace benefits, regulations, etc. 
		- Most employees in a region would prefer mandated time off from their employers if they were fully informed, fully rational and had the power to unilaterally decide what kind of system to live in.
		- However, most employees are incentivized to go to companies that do not provide benefits because these companies tend to be more successful because they are more economically efficient.
		- What about the employees who prefer companies that do not provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by restricting their opportunities? 
			- It is the same restriction that one would feel if either they preferred a style of company that offerred benefits but the market didn't incentivize it. 
			- Thus, without these regulations, people who preferred these regulations would feel the same restrictions in the opposite direction. So the restrictions are equivalent and we should side with whatever is democratically decided. The only difference is one is decided by individuals via their choices in the market, and the other is decided by individuals via their voting preferences. The mechanism imposing the restriction is different, but the restriction *on the minority employees/employees* is identical.
			- It might be argued that the restrictions are different, because in a regulated system there will be *no* companies without these benefits. Whereas in a free system, there would still be *some* companies with those benefits, but people would be incentivized against going there so they would be less successful/frequent. Two responses: (1) the hypothetical was that the free system was such that there are *no* viable, successful companies with benefits in a free market. In which case, the restrictions would be equivalent. (2) if it is the case that there would be some viable successful companies with benefits in a free market but they would be a bit less efficient and so less frequent, then it is not just to force all companies to offer benefits. However, it is just to manipulate taxation such that companies with benefits are at no disadvantage. Assuming the only unwanted externality of the free market as that one's preferred company receives less income (i.e. assuming that's the only reason why people are individually incentivized to perpetuate a system that they don't want), then this will be sufficient regulation and no more is justified. 
		- Okay, employees are not forced any more than in a free market. What about the employers who do not want to provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by not even allowing them to open up their business?
			- See above. The same answers apply.
	- Similar examlpes:
		- Workplace benefits, regulations, etc.
		- Large business undercutting small businesses with low profit margins
		- Theft?
	- When local preferences does not match global preferences
		- I.e. when a person wants system X but they are individually incentivized to perform actions that lead to system Y, because their actions (in an unconstrained free market) only affect their individual benefits, rather than the system as a whole. 
		- Prisoner dillemma, e.g. a company's existence makes everyone's lives worse (e.g. automates all jobs) but no individual has the economic ability to outcompete it (because the larger company's products are all uncompetitively cheap) due to no individual having the incentive to purchase from a different company. 
		- ^ Similar justification as the argument for implementing private property over communally owned resources. E.g. avoids the tragedy of the commons. 

Principles of Justice (in decreasing order of lexical priority) - General principle is equality of opportunity/liberty, with lexical priority given to more important liberties/opportunities:
1. The state protects everyone's basic liberties. E.g. freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom of speech, etc. protected by police, courts, borders, etc. The state also guarantees prerequisites for a functioning democratic society, e.g. education, childcare, etc. This imposes constraints on those who otherwise deliberately assault otherwise (minor constraints), those who would unintentionally limit the constraints of others, e.g. polluting companies (moderate constraints), and on taxpayers (minor constraints).
2. Disparities in opportunity to economic resources must not worsen anyone. Opportunity is meant in a strong sense here, i.e. A and B have equal opportunity iff A and B would have the same outcome if they had identical interests (as opposed to a weak sense of opportunity which merely requires that A and B have the same outcome if they had identical interests AND natural talents). Some notes on how this differs from the difference principle:
	- This principle has no concern with equal (weak or strong) opportunity to all offices and positions, unlike the first part of Rawls' second principle. As for the second part of the principle (the Difference Principle), there are two differences:  
	- This principle focuses on opportunity, rather than outcomes. It allows disparities in outcomes which are not the result of disparities in natural talents. E.g. there can be disparities in resources which are the result of different interests, which means they are not result of disparities of opportunity. Certainly, disparities in interests need not benefit the worse-off. 
	- This principle disallows disparities that worsen others, rather than disparities that do not benefit others. It allows disparities so long as they do not cause the poor (or anyone else) to be worse-off. The baseline for comparison is what a person's outcome would be if the better-off persons/group did not make themselves better off.
3. Other aspects of government control can be decided by democratic election (should principle 2 be included under here?).
	- The following conditions must be met:
		- The policy must be as decentralized as possible (prevent tyranny of the majority).
		- The policy must constrain certain citizen's behavior no more than how much other citizens would be constrained if the policy was not enacted. Economic policies fit well here.
		- An epistocratic system is fine: we can ban minors, felons, mentally handicapped, etc. from voting. The bans cannot be too widespread as it might lead to disenfranchisement. The precise line to draw must be settled empirically.
		- The state is the only way to alleviate such constraints OR the behavior that is constrained is legitimate only because of contractual support of citizens (e.g. think workplace or company regulations).
	- Voting on regulating economic resources (e.g. taxation)
		- Only allowed to account for cases where people are not incentivized to directly subsidize what they want. E.g. people want a museum, but people are not incentivized to provide initial funds (e.g. because startup costs are too high, there is little awareness of the museum initially, etc.).
	- Voting on regulating personal movement/behavior.
		- E.g. public nudity. 

Lexical priority of basic opportunities/liberties that everyone needs as a means towards wellbeing. Constraints on the lower priority are justified to protect constraints of higher priority:
1. Freedom from assault, natural disasters, bodily autonomy. Protection from constraints on one's choices.
2. Opportunity to education, occupation, basic self-determination. Develop the capacity to make informed, rational choices.
3. Political power
4. Freedom of speech, association, etc.
5. Freedom to use property
- How to rank priorities? Liberties/opportunities of type A trump those of type B if A freedoms are necessary to take advantage of those of type B

			==================================================================
										Justification
			==================================================================

------- Higher Level Justification -------

Why liberty is the only thing that matters
	- Imagine a world of fully informed, fully rational agents with maximal equal liberty. How can coercion be justified here? To promote the aims of a particular agent?
	- On what basis can we justify coercing A to benefit B?

Why be concerned with *resources* rather than *wellbeing*?:
	 - Some components of well-being are illegitimate - e.g. preferences that other people are harmed. External preferences, which are concerned with how the lives of others go, e.g. preferences to be loved by others. 
	 - Sometimes people are responsible for their lower wellbeing - e.g. if they are overly sensitive, if they misused their resources, etc.
	 - Instead focus on resources which are the means for wellbeing.

Why be concerned with *opportunity* to resources rather than *holdings* in resources
	- i.e. we should try to equalize/guarantee opportunity, rather than holdings directly.
	- Because some disparities in resources may be the result of choices, i.e. people can be responsible for the resources they acquire.
	- People with more than their fare share of resources should be penalized only insofar as it prevents others from acquiring a similar share of resources.

Strategy:
1. Appeal of self-ownership
2. Some qualifications on self-ownership rights
	- Lockean Proviso - people have to leave enough for others
	- Non-pacifism / Enforcement rights - people have a right to self-defense
	- Unilateral Property rights - people have a right to prevent others from controlling a resource if they are in some special relation with that resource (i.e. if they are the owners of the resource), even if they don't get consent of a large group of other people
	- Strong liberty-rights over infinite claim-rights - to avoid the paralysis objection. E.g. otherwise, I can't smoke because smoke particles might land on your property. Conflicts between liberty-rights and claim-rights:
		- Moral anarchy: everyone has a right to do whatever they want. This doesn't work because having a right to X requires that others not have a right to stop one from X-ing.
		- Rights equilibrium: A only has a right to X if B does not have a right to stop from X-ing. I.e. if A has a liberty-right to X, then A has a claim-right to X, which is to say that B does not have a liberty-right to stop X-ing. 
		- Moral paralysis: But this is compatible with saying everyone has a right to not be annoyed/disturbed in the slightest. I.e. Everyone has infinite claim-rights, which means no one has any liberty-rights.
		- For every proposed claim-rights, there is a correspondingly reduced liberty-right. Thus, there are infinitely many possible systems of rights in equilibrium, some that give infinite weight to claim-rights (no one can do anything), and some that give more power to liberty-rights. How do we strike the perfect balance?
		- We must strike the balance that choses the right that is more serious. E.g. A's liberty-right to smoke trumps B's claim-right to be completely free of smoke particles, as the former is more serious than the latter. On the other hand, A's liberty-right to buy unowned land is trumped by B's right to travel (e.g. imagine these rights conflict because the unowned land is the only possible path for B to exit an island).
3. Similar considerations support exception rights. 
	- Appealing to self-ownership alone doesn't seem to motivate these moves. An equally consistent self-ownership position might deny all of these. On the other hand, an equal liberty thesis can explain this. It can also account for the unintuitive aspects of anarchism.
	- These considerations are meant to prevent paralysis
	- Without these additional constraints, some people (or all, in the case of the infinite claim rights) would be paralyzed from being able to act morally. They would be forced to die.
	- E.g. everyone needs property. With no lateral property rights, people woudn't have permission to get the resources they need without consent of others, which might make them starve. Without lockean proviso, someone could own the entire planet, and people would be forced to starve. Without qualified claim-rights, people wouldn't be able to do any action because every action has a tiny affect on others (e.g. causing a speck of dust to enter their home). Which means people wouldn't have the ability to do anything. They would be forced to starve.
	- Likewise, without exception rights (i.e. minor infingements on the rights of others if it is necessary to alleviate major constraints on an innocent person; or, in a different formulation, a re-articulation of rights such that people don't have claim-rights so strong that others are forbidden from such minor intrusions), people would be forced to starve through no fault of their own. E.g. Pushing someone to save a life? 
4. Exception rights are sufficient to justify a minimum state - national defense, police protection, criminal justice, courts, and private property (whatever conception of property rights is decided). 
5. None of these qualifications are necessary for a self-ownership position
	- None of these considerations are necessary for a system of rights. They are all internally consistent.
	- They seem to be motivated not be placing self-ownership as the fundamental value, but by either (1) valuing maximum equal positive liberty or (2) guaranteeing a maximum baseline of positive liberty above all else.
6. If we are focusing on maximum equal positive liberty, that supports democratic processes for policies that would equally affect all parties. 
	- Different regions can enact different policies on contract enforcement, private property usage, economic systems, etc. based on their choosing. While this need not support *full* property ownership rights, everyone should have some basic property *usage* rights, even though it might be subject to taxation, regulation, etc. 
	- The government also needs to guarantee the minimum requirements for a functioning democratic society. E.g. free care for children, free education, etc.

Principles: Key 
- "Major" hindrances to freedom (i.e. acts of assault, imprisonment, death, etc.) are justified only to prevent other "major" hindrances to freedom (idea from Kant). Fully informed, fully rational parties with equal opportunity are not allowed to aggress one another, even for some overall increase in utility. This is consistent with basic self-defense rights allowed under anarcho-capitalism. I.e. people have a negative right to their negative freedom.
- Victim-defensed based permissions. If X is justified in coercing/aggressing Y in self-defense when Y is the criminal, X is also justified in aggressing/coercing Z in self-defense when Z is innocent. I.e. strangers have a negative right to defend the negative freedom of others, even if this violates the negative rights of others.
- Third-party protection. If X is justified in coercing/aggressing Y in self-defense, then X is also justified in coercing/aggressing Y to protect third-party Z. Defense-based protections + third-party protections justifies mandated taxation protecting everyone's negative freedom allowed under minarchism. 
- Positive freedom matters more than negative freedom. This justifies minarchism + welfare protections from non-agent caused constraints. 
- Equal freedom for everyone. This justifies the kind of minarchism + limited, decentralized democracy that I support.

Two possible strategies to move away from anarchism
1. Downplay the importance of self-ownership (i.e. against right-winged libertarianism)
	- Either accept a list of exceptions that justify violating one's rights to self-ownership, or
	- Re-formulate self-ownership in a way that justifies initiating intrusions on one's autonomy.
	- Can be used to justify:
		- Suppressing free speech / freedom of association when it is needed to prevent oppression
		- Slander/libel laws
		- Various economic/occupational regulations (other than redistribution, which can be justified purely with an egalitarian theory of property rights)
2. Accept full self-ownership in the same way as right-winged libertarians, but
	- Deny that this leads to a right-leaning theory of property rights
	- Instead accept an egalitarian theory of property rights
Trouble: 
	- We want an egalitarian theory of property rights, without an egalitarian theory of natural assets/autonomy. I.e. everyone in the world is not equally entitled to the use of one's body.

------- Lower Level Justification -------

Idealization
- Imagine idealized world: everyone is fully informed, fully rational, equal starting liberty (i.e. equal talents, equal abilities, equal starting natural resources, etc.) and none of our goals conflict. Coercion is not justified here (although no one would want to use coercion).
- Now, say everyone is fully informed, fully rational, with equal starting positive liberty and our goals sometimes conflict. When is coercion justified?
	- Property protection.
	- Self-defense.
	- Contract-enforcement.
	- Protection against fraud.
- What kind of world do fully informed, fully rational individuals prefer to live in?


- How to move from equality to minarchism + decentralized democracy. Equality is valued in itself on principle. Minarchism, democracy and decentralization are valued based on various empirical facts (e.g. a benevolent dictator would be okay if it were possible). What is a test for what we value in principle? How to articulate what equality truly consists in? E.g. can it be articulated via some ideal procedure such as e.g. Rawl's veil of ignorance.
- Problem with Rawl's veil of ignorance is that it reduces to maximizes one's expected value, which can result in subjugating someone else. It conflates blind rationality with moral justification. However, the veil of ignorance is useful for avoiding irrelevant considerations from fitting into one's moral reasoning, i.e. rich people are more disposed to favor laisez faire capitalism, and the poor will want to favor redistribution, racial majorities will be okay with subjugating the minority, etc. How else can we avoid this?
	- Perhaps instead of using a veil of ignorance for the contractual setup, we keep people in the actual world where they are informed of their actual place in society. Instead of people voting on particular policies (e.g. protect freedom from assault), we vote on principles expressed in abstract terms of resources (not welfare or utility). Actually, instead of the principles being expressed in terms of *actual* resources, they are expressed in terms of *opportunity* to resources. Only accept principles concerning the distribution of opportunity to resources (expressed in an abstract manner) that can be justified to all. 
	- Problem: Wouldn't people be incentivized to vote according to resource distribution, rather than opportunity distributions?
		- It seems that resource distributions ought to be choice- or ambition-sensitive, i.e. if two people have equal opportunity and ability, and one prioritizes leisure over wealth, we need not correct for any inequalities in resources that result from this difference in choices. Perhaps this can be accounted for by including leisure time in the resource distribution that will be voted on. 
		- But even including leisure time in the resources doesn't seem to account for the relevant choice sensitivity. People not only make different economic choices because of different values, but also because they are more risky or less rational. For example, A might come to have less economic resources than B not because A received some other good (such as leisure) which he values more than A does, but because he was irrationally lazy (e.g. due to weakness of will) or because he is fundamentally more risky. It seems that inequalities that arise from this difference in choices also need not be corrected.  
	- Problem: Does this lead to the unintuitive conclusion that we distribute opportunity to resources equally? This might be intuitive in the case of ownership of property, but not for ownership over one's body. 
		- Why would people vote to support equal access to property, but not mass equal access to physical bodies? Indeed, some limitations on the bodies of others are justified (e.g. think immigration, public nudity, laws etc.). But how to avoid the conclusion that the state should steal a healthy person's kidney and donate it to one in need?
		- Perhaps, it cannot be avoided. Rather, let people vote to decide what kind of society to live in. Those who are willing to accept large resource deficits for larger benefits will be placed in a society where mandatory kidney extraction is allowed. Others will live in a different society.
	- How will people vote in these issues? How does one know what it means for something to represent X resources rather than Y? It seems we cannot express these in terms of abstract resource amounts. But now people might be biased if they vote for policies directly.

										Questions
			==================================================================

Problems:
- Individual permissions without state permissions, and vice-versa?
	- E.g. Enacting major constraints to alleviate major constraints
		- The state is not permitted to do this
		- Individuals are permitted to do this
		- Why? Some other reason, but it's not related to the arguments given thus far.
	- E.g. Can the state be selective in who it coerces (e.g. a certain racial group)?
		- Individuals can, but not a state. 
		- Why? States must be fair?
	- E.g. state permissions without individual permissions
		- Can neighbors steal from your account to fund a charity? 
		- No, Why? We must have a monopoly on force? 
			- But this proves too much. If I'm in a blizzard, can I break into your house?
				- The difference between the blizzard and the charity is the blizzard is an unexpected rare event. This is relevant because if we allow private coercion in rare cases (e.g. a blizzard) this will not undermine general safety. But if we allow it generally (e.g. people can steal from others to donate to charity), this puts us back into the state of nature.
- Does laws against slander/libel count as minor constraints to alleviate major constraints? What about subsidizing laws against petty theft? Is it because the effects of not having a law against these actions would result in major constraints?
- Maximal equal liberty might be appropriate for property, but not for self-ownership or natural assets. Imagine a government decides to kill members of a minority group to save the lives of 5 members of a majority group (e.g. kidney donation). It may also have democratic appeal (since the beneficaries are in the majority). This does not seem just. People really do come into the world owning certain things. Some ways to account for this intuition while accomodating state coercion generally:
	- The state is justified in *threatening* to use assault or forcibly confiscating innocent's resources to save the lives of others, but they are not justified in *actually* assaulting innocents.
	- The individuals in the dire situations in the majority group may be permitted to kill the members of the minority (for the same reasons an individual can take the last piece of food to save his life even if it kills others), but that doesn't mean the state is.
	- All members need some reason to respect the policy.
- Do exception rights support samariton laws? I.e. it should be illegal to let someone die.
	- Problem: my intuition against samariton laws plus 
	- Maybe. Only if the punishment is fines (comparable to taxation) instead of imprisonment. Otherwise the burden is too great.
	- I will not entertain questions about the difference between the burden of fines (which are backed by the threat of imprisonment) and imprisonment itself. 
- More extensive arbitrary communal preferences?
	- Problem: my belief about the justification restrictive immigration plus libertarian beliefs
	- Restrictive immigration already mentioned
	- Might there be more possibilities?
		- Having sex in public 
		- Anti-nudity laws
		- Anti- fraud/slander/libel laws
		- Anti- hard drugs laws (e.g. even when they don't result in a reduce material quality of life for non-drug users, but they result in more homeless/laze underclass population).
		- Suppressing free speech / freedom of association when it is needed to prevent oppression
		- Various economic/occupational regulations (other than redistribution)
		- Immigration restrictions
	- This may be possible if:
		- Certain laws are non-negotiable: e.g. police, courts, education, etc.
		- The constraints imposed are low.
		- The constraints alleviated are high.
		- The scope of the community is small.
		- There is ample land outside of this region.
	- Abstract away from the empirical limitations of migration:
		- Imagine persons in the original position. Every square mile of land is equally valuable. There is a lot of land. Everyone is allocated a square mile. They get to negotiation among each other about where to live and what kind of laws they want. Certain people move to the north where they ban X, others move to the south where they allow X but ban Y. Is this okay? It seems like it. But what if someone bans, e.g. public displays of affection? This seems okay if there are plenty of areas to choose in the original position that do not ban it, but what if everyone banned it?
	- How can cultural preferences justify force? I thought only opportunity to resources mattered? Perhaps, this is justified because the constrained members have opportunity outside of the community.
	- Perhaps on a global level, we guarantee equality of opportunity for groups. Within certain regions, we guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals. 

General:
- Relationship bewteen morality and political legitimacy 
- How to establish a theory of property rights? Is it decided democratically?
- Threshold instead of major vs minor?
	- Specify a threshold of positive freedom that we're all entitled to
		- E.g. includes access to equal share of resources
		- Ability to make informed, rational choices about how to live one's life
		- Etc.
	- People above the threshold can be taxed to bring others above the threshold, so long as it doesn't bring anyone below it.
- This need not apply to all societies, i.e. non-liberal societies without an emphasis on rationality, individuality.
- How to handle state failures?
	- Either due to incompetence or mallace, a state fails to provide individuals with certain opportunities.
	- Do other sibling states or parent states have permission/obligation to intervene to provide individuals with opportunity?
	- They have the permission, but not the obligation. It depends on the democratic support of the other/broader society.
	- The intervention should be minor/temporary to bring the minor states up to a level of competence, rather than *merely* directly providing the resources/goods to the citizens.
- Qualifications
	- Emphasize the permissions of others to use force, not a duty by others to acquiesce.
- This avoids empirical questions:
	- Whether a state is actually necessary. The only point is what kinds of coercive behavior an "agency" might be justified in doing. Whether it warrants the name "state" is another matter.
	- The largest justified scope of a state. Probably smaller than a globe. Probably larger than a town. Somewhere in the middle. Whether this is consistent with anarchism is another question.
	- Whether a welfare state is required for adults. Do adults have reasonable chance of gaining employment? Could it be justified from the fact that our economy has made some people worse-off?

### Formal Liberty

- Terminology
	- belief + desire = intention
	- ability (internal to agent) + opportunity (external to agent) = capacity 
	- intention + capacity = actualization
	- "constrained" = there is an interference
	- "coercion" = the interference is via another agent.
- Triadic relationship:
	- x is free iff x (an agent) has freedom from y (some interference) in achieving z (some goal).
	- Formal versus Effective freedom concerns which characterizations of y matter. Is an agent free simply if they lack interference from other external agents (formal freedom) or if they lack interference from other agents and non-agent inference, including interference from their lack of abilites or internal characteristics (effective freedom)?
	- A different way of characterizating the relationship:
		- x is free to z iff x (an agent) would achieve z if certain conditions C obtained. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), it is due to failing to meet some condition in C rather than some cause y (y is not in C). If x does not achieve z because of y, then x is not free.
		- Formal Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions, ability, lack of external interferences, etc. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free), this is due to some reason other than agent interference.
		- Maximal Effective Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), this is due to some reason other than some interference.
- What counts as x?:
	- Preference vs autonomy?
	- Freedom to do as one wants, or freedom to do as what one would want if they were rational?
	- E.g. rational self vs animal/empirical self
- What sources of interference y?:
	- Internal interferences, external interferences, other agent interferences?
	- Formal liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of agent intereference in seeking z
	- Effective liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of external/internal interference in seeking z
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities and historical intentions/abilities (i.e. he might not have the capacity to achieve z now, but he is free to z because would be have the capacity to achieve z if he had planned accordingly).
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities
		- [x] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions
			- i.e. people don't have a right to these things per se, e.g. food, water. So they can't justify coercing people just because they lack them. Rather they have the right to the opportunity to acquire these goods. E.g. if a person is in a situation where through no fault of their own they are unable to acquire food, they can coerce others to retrieve it. 
		- [ ] Directly providing z (A has z)
	- Qualiification to "intentions". I.e. "x is free to z iff x would z if he had the appropriate intentions and the intentions are of type T"?
		- Any intentions? E.g. We're all free to be successful authors because we would be successful authors if we had the appropriate intentions, e.g. adopted the intentions involved in writing certain words on a piece of paper. But clearly there's a sense in which some are free to be successful authors whereas others are not. 
		- Intentions that we know of. E.g. we're not free to be successful authors because we do not know which intentions to adopt to become successful, even though we would be successful if we adopted those intentions.
		- Intentions that we know of that are not coerced. E.g. if we would be killed if we did z (but there was no interference), then we are not free to do z. Less extremely, if there were severe penalties for doing z (e.g. social ostrasization) for doing z, then we are less free to do it.
		- Intentions devoid of any causal influence. E.g. libertarian free will. No.
- What constitutes "interference"?
	- At the very least, it must be something that plays a causal role in preventing an agent from actualizing an intention.
	- Physical obstacle?
	- Emotional distress?
	- Something in the middle?
		- Loud music, bright lights, etc. are harmful even though they are no more "physical" than disliked music, colors, etc. Why are they special?
		- Because they are harms that bypass an interpretative framework? 
		- Because they are of a higher quantity than other harms?
		- They restrict an agent's aims, independently of their intentions.
	- y is an interference for x achieving z if the following conditions are met:
		- y causes a state of affairs such that x cannot achieve z regardless of his intentions.
			- Too strong? What if y makes it such that x can only achieve z with rather costly intentions?
			- (avoid issues regarding the meaning "causation")
- What kind of z are people entitled to?
	- Any arbitrary aim? Property? Well-being? Suffering? Capacity for self-actualization?
	- Can't be any aim. E.g. you might have the aim that I not be homosexuals.
	- Can't be happiness.
	- Requires a qualitative ranking of what kinds of liberties matter.
	- Things that matters:
		- Basic Needs - food, water, shelter
		- Protection from assault, bodily autonomy
		- Property
		- Occupation?
	- This requires a qualitative, rather than merely quantitative, comparison of liberty tradeoffs. E.g. it might be the case that taxation reduces a rich person's liberty more than it promotes the liberty of a poor person. If you just enumerated all the activities that the rich person is prevented from doing and all the activities that the poor person can now do, it might be that more activities were reduced for the rich. However, this doesn't mean we can't limit the rich person's freedom. What matters is not just the amount of liberty, but the value of the liberty. The poor person is now free to perform more important activities (e.g. afford shelting, healthy food, etc.). Speaking of "overall liberty" when making these tradeoffs is a red herring.
- Function: how to respect liberty?
	- Simple Consequentialist? 
		- E.g. Maximize sum, maximize average, maximize worse-off, minimize number of people below a threshold? 
		- Maybe minimize number of people below a threshold, but no to the maximizing options.
	- Simple Deontologist? Never restrict or limit? 
		- E.g. Self-ownership, from which we extend property rights
		- No. Too strong. Leads to anarchism
	- Hierarchical Deontology? Possibly
		- Not consequentialist because:
			- People are permitted to harm others to save themselves, even if this makes a worse state of affairs. 
			- Our duties are not to aim towards some ideal state of affairs.
			- Agent-relative
			- Not aggregative
		- Create a ranked order of constraints on liberty, e.g. type 0, type 1, type 2, etc.
			- Type 0 are most important, e.g. constraints on life, movement, etc. (this does not include significant emotional harm, e.g. seeing what you perceive to be a sin, because there could be a norm whereby that harm is diminished). These are features that can limit a person independently of their intentions.
			- Type 0 violations are permitted to prevent other type 0 constraints
			- For all i, type i violations are permitted to prevent type j (where j< i) constraints
			- Constraints of different types are not commensurate
			- Type 0 = basic needs
			- Type 1 = bodily autonomy 
			- Type 2 = property
		- Threshold
			- Concerns what the state can do.
			- There is some base level threshold of freedom. The state is justified in enacting coercion M to group A in order to help group B, so long as (1) A is above the threshold, (2) B is below the threshold, (3) M does not leave individuals in A below the threshold, (4) M brings individuals in B above the threshold.
			- There might be multiple thresholds. Today, that threshold might involve something like public education, healthcare, police force, etc. Hypothetically, it could also involve saving people from torture. We might be able to force those in A to save those in B from being tortured, even if it subjects those in A to poor education, policing, etc. Or maybe there's a single threshold and if everyone is forced to be under it, there are no moral standards.
			- Insofar as the individuals in A are responsible for B being worse-off, they are obligated to assist in this.
			- Insofar as the individuals in B are not responsible, they are permitted to resist (even though the state is still justified to use force).
			- When coercion is permissible
				- If everyone is above the threshold, coercion is never permissible.
				- If everyone is below the threshold, and there's no way for an individual to get above the threshold without preventing someone else frmo going above it, then coercion is always permissible. There's just a conflict. Although it might be that justification and permissibility are concepts that don't really apply (e.g. in the state of nature).

### Disagreement

Broader laws are mandatory, non-negotiable. Local laws are decided democratically. Note also that the broader laws tend to be more libertarian whereas the local laws have the potential to be more authoritarian. In principle, the broader laws could be more authoritarian in different countries where there is homogenous culture where everyone agrees to some authoritarian rules. 

Perhaps, the ideal laws for a given region are simply the upshot of norms of the culture of that region. For homogenous societies, they are free to enforce whatever rules they prefer. However, when a region has a large diversity of opinion, then the range of acceptable laws narrows. The ideal laws for a region are the laws that it would be rational for that region to accept. However, if the views of a region are so diverse, then the only laws that it would be rational for a region to accept would be minimal libertarian laws that emphasized freedom and liberty. Laws regulating international affairs are the extreme of this: the only international laws there are are basic respect for the sovereignty of nations, protection from genocide, etc.

Coercive laws for members of group G are justified if and only if such laws would be approved of by fully informed and fully rational members of group G assuming they sought coercive laws to regulate behavior. A law is appropriate for group G only if it is the upshot of ideal social construction. When there is broad disagreement, the only laws that overlap with everyone's fully rational interest would be minimal libertarian laws.

Must explain the relationship between disagreement and ideal socially constructed norms in a way that explains:
1. That widespread disagreement implies that minarchism.
2. That minimal, but existent, disagreement does not imply minarchism.

### Against common libertarian arguments

#### Against Anarchism

Elbow Room (intruding on innocents/non-responsible):
- Unilateral property acquisition (opposed to joint ownership)
- Lockean proviso
- Trivial Intrusions
- Lifeboat scenarios

Iniations of force accepted by anarchist (admittedly, these are intrusions on those who are guilty or at least responsible)
- Against tresspassers
- Against those who would control our property
- Against threats
- Against fraud
- To enforce contracts
- Enforcement rights

1. Violating the NAP is a violation of rights
2. It is always morally permissible to violate rights
3. The state violates the NAP
4. Therefore, the state is morally impermissible

Premise 3 is true
- It takes property from others under the threat of force. 
- It regulates their behavior. 
- It maintains a monopoly on force, preventing others from exercising their rights to self-defense.

Premise 2 is unclear
- Can I violate your rights if it prevents 2 more serious rights violations against you in the future?
- E.g. can I push you if it would prevent you from getting hit by a truck?
- Perhaps, this aren't rights violations because the victim would permit it.
- E.g. can I violate one of your minor rights, to alleviate major rights violations of others?
- E.g. take some of your property to save someone from being raped?

Permise 1 is doubful - there are two readings of the Non-aggression principle
- Aggression = violation of someone's rights. Moralized conception.
	- This is circular.
- Aggression = an intrusion on someone's behavior. Non-moralized conception.
	- But anarchists prohibit acts which are not physical aggression E.g. tresppassing on someone's land, breach of contract, or fraud.
	- Anarchists permit initiations of physical aggression, i.e. when in defense of one's property. E.g. aggressing against tresspassed, breached a contract or committed fraud.
	- The NAP alone doesn't tell us what theory of property rights to accept (unless one said that one's possessions was their property). One's theory of property rights needs an independent justification and articulation. Indeed, a socialists can claim to uphold the NAP and adopt an egalitarian theory of property.
- The NAP is not a foundational value; it uses a moralized conception of aggression.

So reject premise 1 because:
- Even anarchist don't take NAP to be a foundational principle. 
	- If it's moralized then its not foundation. 
	- If its not moralized then its absurd.
- Rather, accept something like the "anti-paralysis" postulate. Don't specify rights in a way such that the claim-rights are so strong that they prohibit individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that those the rights were meant to protect, even when doing so imposes a minor constraint on others.
- Anarchists might not accept that because it ascribes to people rights to coerce others to avoid non-agent-caused constraints on their freedom (even though they should accept this given their other beliefs about our rights to e.g. property, protect against breach of fraud, etc. which involve coercing others to avoid non-agent-caused constraints on their freedom). Okay fine. But people do have a right to self-defense, to protect themselves to powerful gangs. They have the right to protect this right if the only way to reasonably do so is by imposing a minor constraints on others. This would be a moralized anti-paralysis postulate: Don't specify rights in a way such that the claim-rights are so strong that they prohibit individuals from protecting other rights that they have, even when doing so imposes a minor constraint on others. The "other rights" this refers to are the rights to protection from gangs.

Historical:
	- Anarchism has been destroyed at every point in history. Why assume an anarchist society could defend itself?
	- Maybe it won't.
		- Then this is pointless.

Logistical:
	- How do people defend themselves from assault?
	- Private defense agencies.
	- How is that different from a state?
	- (a) no monopoly, (b) no taxation, and (c) they follow the NAP
	- As for (b) and (c), why assume there would respect the NAP? History shows that people don't in general follow the NAP, so why assume they would under anarchism?
	- So we've established that these coorporations would not follow the NAP.
	- As for (a), (b) and (c): there could be a sole coorporation in a given area, either because they were the first or because they outcompeted everyone else. What's stop them from becoming a state? If there is competition, what's to stop a war from occuring between several defense agencies (e.g. over religion or whatever) leading to a victor.

#### Against Minarchism

Intuitive:
	- Is it justified to break someone's property to save someone from drowning if they were pushed in by someone else whom you cannot identify?
	- Yes, because you have to protect their negative rights.
	- But this violates the negative rights of the property owner.
	- This is okay, because we have a duty to protect the negative rights of others.
	- Shouldn't we also have a duty to protect the positive rights of others then?
	- No
	- What if someone is drowning not because someone pushed him but because of a gust of wind? Is this a relevant consideration?

What justifies using coercion to force others to support a state?

To protect the negative rights of others.

So people have a positive right to protection from violence

Against Nozick's minimum state
- We all have full and absolute rights to self-ownership and any property rights that follow from this. Whether a distribution is just depends on historical facts about how the distribution came to be, not end state facts about the current state of the distribution. If all property owned today came either via initial acquisition or free transfer, then the distribution is just, regardless of its inequality.
- (1) How to account for any just violations of liberty? Self-ownership implies full and absolute propety rights. How to account for positive rights to negative liberty (e.g. taxation)? Minor infringements on liberty to alleviate major constraints on others? Everyday behaviors that inevitably put others at risk (e.g. smoking causes pollution)? A theory of maximum equal baseline liberty can account for this. But a self-ownership argument to support this seems ad hoc, and may actually require appealing to maximum baseline liberty. 
- (2) How to account for property in the real world? Nozick states that we have rights to property because we have a right to our bodies, our labor and talents. Thus we have a right to any external resources we gain with the exercise of our talents/labor. But this is conditional on legitimate acquisition of those resources. We can own property by (1) appropriating unowned property contingent on the Lockean proviso, (2) being the recipient of a free transfer of property, or (3) being the recipient of legitimate rectification. The problem is almost none of the property owned today has been justly acquired since it's the result of war, subjugation, oppression, plunder, etc. and the idea of rectifying these unjustices in implausible. If we instead have a system of maximum equal baseline liberty, we can have a just system without dealing with going through history.

### Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

It has to do with justification of state coercion. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:
- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

It does not reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. 
- This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.
- It would not be immoral for A to steal from B if it required saving A's life, but B should the right to refuse.
- It would be immoral for B to stop A from getting B's money to save his life, but A should not have that right.
- The distinction is due to the difference between an individual being morally permitted to coerce someone, and the state being permitted to coerce someone. You can have individual permission without state permission, and vice-versa.
- E.g. individual permission without state permission: an individual can kill one person to save themselves. And perhaps an individual can kill one person to save another. But the state cannot kill one to save one. 
- This is because to do so would be to express priority of one person's life to another. The state is supposed to be impartial with regard to the value of its individual citizens. An individual has permission to give priority of his own life over others in situations where one must die, but not the state. The state is supposed to be an impartial judge that can be justified to all citizens.
- E.g. in the other direction: It is justified to tax the rich to fund the education of the poor, but the poor cannot steal from the rich to fund their own education. You might say: this is because of the negative effects of allowing the latter moral principle to govern society, i.e. we would be afraid of being robbed spontaneously, unlike the government which is transparent and predictable. But even if the stealing was transparent and predictable (i.e. say, the church was doing the stealing, and they had their own constitution), it would still be wrong.
