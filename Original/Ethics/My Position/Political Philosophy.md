From Sep: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism
-  They hold, for example, that each person has a right to maximum equal negative liberty, which is understood as the absence of forcible interference from other agents (e.g., Narveson 1988; Steiner 1994; Narveson & Sterba 2010). This is sometimes called “Spencerian Libertarianism” (after Herbert Spencer).
- Most, however, focus more on the idea of self-ownership. Famously, this view is attributed to Robert Nozick (Cohen 1995; but see the discussion below).
- Full self-ownership might seem to condemn as wrongful even very minor infringements of the personal sphere, such as when tiny bits of pollution fall upon an unconsenting person...This objection, however, is of dubious force as it presupposes an (even more) implausible conception of full self-ownership than its defenders have reason to endorse. Suppose we understand the moral benefits that self-ownership confers along two dimensions: protections from unwanted uses of our bodies, and liberties to use our bodies. As the objection points out, it is not possible to simultaneously maximize the value of both dimensions: our protections restrict our liberties by restricting the possible uses of one’s body, and vice versa. Since maximizing the protection-dimension implausibly restricts the use-dimension, the correct response is not to reject self-ownership, but rather to loosen the protection-dimension somewhat in order to enhance the use-dimension. Doing this would allow minor infringements for the sake of self-ownership. As Eric Mack (2015) puts it, a good theory of self-ownership offers people some “elbow room.” (For more discussion, see Brennan & Van der Vossen 2017)
- Libertarian theory can thus be defended in many different ways [rather than taking self-ownership to be a self-evident foundational principle]. This is true both of theories that give pride of place to self-ownership and of theories that don’t. Examples of the former include Eric Mack (2002, 2010) who sees self-ownership rights as among several natural rights grounded in our nature as purposive beings. In Mack’s view, the protections and freedoms offered by the idea are justified in order to grant to all individuals a separate sphere in which they can act in accordance to their self-chosen purposes. Similarly, Loren Lomasky (1987) derives rights from a related, although slightly different, conception of people as project pursuers. John Tomasi (2012) argues that strong rights over our bodies are required by the ideal of democratic legitimacy. According to Daniel Russell (2018), self-ownership rights provide the only way that people who live together can all genuinely live their own lives.

## Notes

The Libertarian project:
1. Some moral principle (i.e. Kantian treating everyone as an end)
	- Self-ownership versus maximum equal liberty. 
		- MEL avoids some of the problems with self-ownership. E.g. using force in dire circumstances. Permitting minor infringements on self-ownership to promote the liberty of others. It may be able to explain democratic regions with coercive policies. It allows saving a N number of people's lives by sacrificing a few lives (note: this concerns comparable harm). 
		- MEL also retains the appeal of self-ownership. E.g. it is not permitted to cause major infringement to a small number of people to alleviate minor limitations of a large number of people. It need not be aggregative.
		- Self-ownership might be a good hueristic given that certain liberties are already granted for the most part (e.g. not being tortured to death). The prinicple of MEL might be the more general principle. 
2. Articulate a conception of liberty
	- Triadic relation: x is free iff x (an agent) has freedom from y (some interference) in achieving z (some goal).
	- What kind of x matters? The actual agent? Their fully informed rational self? Their moral self?
	- What kind of interferences matter? External agents? All external constraints? Internal constraints?
	- What kind of goals? Any arbitrary goals? Goals related to one's movement of their body? 
3. Articulate how we ought to respect liberty 
	- Never constrain others? Literally impossible. Even under anarchism, there are justified constraints on the behavior of others. E.g. private property justified using force to stop others from acquiring certain resources, self defense, etc.
	- Maximize? Doesn't seem right.
	- Threshold? Perhaps.
4. Articulate a conception of property rights
	- A system of norms determining when force can be used to constrain how resources are to be used.
	- What constitutes ownership? Full exercise of property use? Partial?
	- Communal property or individual?
	- Explain how the Lockean proviso is justified
5. Explain how the state is justified (for non-anarchists)
	- A centralized authority on the use of force not granted to common citizens.

Questions to be answered
1. Relationship bewteen morality and political legitimacy
2. Justified uses of coercion
	- What *kinds* of behaviors are subject to coercion? E.g. can private life be coerced?
	- What *kinds* of interests could justify coercing another group? can hatred justify coercion?
3. Why it seems we owe less to distant others? I.e. account for the sovereignty of nations
	- Many of the justifications to a local state do not apply globally. E.g. to protect oneself in a region might require using force in that region, but it does not require forcing everyone across the globe. I.e. anarchy is feasible on a global scale. Hypothetically, if some group could not get protection without the aid of some foreign country, then it could be justified to force that nation to assist. However, this is weird because (1) The poor nation would probably just be acquired by the stronger one, and (2) it seems strange that the poorer nation could force us to help if they can't protect themselves,
	- The scope of coercion can only be as expansive (geographically and temporally) as necessary (e.g. perhaps force is required temporally to provide people with the education to be self-sufficient, at which point it is no longer justified.).
4. Justifying the state without positive rights.
5. Different levels of coercion: physical coercion, property redistribution, etc.
	- Major infringements of bodily autonomy (e.g. enslavement)
	- Minor infringements of bodily autonomy (e.g. brushing against someone).
	- Property confiscation.
6. Account for dire circumstances/consequences
	- Preconditions for moral duties to apply depend upon a certain relationship existing. If we're all starving to death, morality doesn't apply. It's just a power struggle. We have to be in conditions such that we now have reason to enter a relationship of mutual recognition.
	- If we are considering inflicting *massive* harm to an individual to alleviate *minor* harm to a lot of people, this is never justified.
	- If we are considering inflicting some *massive* harm to an innocent individual to alleviate *comparable* harm to more innocents, this is justified when:
		- If we do nothing, all parties will suffer the harm.
		- All parties are equally responsible for exposing themselves to the risk of the harm. E.g. the workers on the trolley problem. Contrast this with: killing a random innocent to save a group of people working on the trolley; the innocent did not consent to the risk whereas the workers did.
		- In other cases, generally, no, this is not justified. What about dire circumstances? I.e. 1 person versus one million? This is a difficult question with no obvious answer. It's not obvious that there needs to be an obvious answer.

## Against common libertarian arguments

### Against Anarchism

Intuitive: Is it justified to break someone's property to save someone drowning? The say no.

Historical:
	- Anarchism has been destroyed at every point in history. Why assume an anarchist society could defend itself?
	- Maybe it won't.
		- Then this is pointless.

Logistical:
	- How do people defend themselves from assault?
	- Private defense agencies.
	- How is that different from a state?
	- (a) no monopoly, (b) no taxation, and (c) they follow the NAP
	- As for (b) and (c), why assume there would respect the NAP? History shows that people don't in general follow the NAP, so why assume they would under anarchism?
	- So we've established that these coorporations would not follow the NAP.
	- As for (a), (b) and (c): there could be a sole coorporation in a given area, either because they were the first or because they outcompeted everyone else. What's stop them from becoming a state? If there is competition, what's to stop a war from occuring between several defense agencies (e.g. over religion or whatever) leading to a victor.

### Against Minarchism

Intuitive:
	- Is it justified to break someone's property to save someone from drowning if they were pushed in by someone else whom you cannot identify?
	- Yes, because you have to protect their negative rights.
	- But this violates the negative rights of the property owner.
	- This is okay, because we have a duty to protect the negative rights of others.
	- Shouldn't we also have a duty to protect the positive rights of others then?
	- No
	- What if someone is drowning not because someone pushed him but because of a gust of wind? Is this a relevant consideration?

What justifies using coercion to force others to support a state?

To protect the negative rights of others.

So people have a positive right to protection from violence

Against Nozick's minimum state
- We all have full and absolute rights to self-ownership and any property rights that follow from this. Whether a distribution is just depends on historical facts about how the distribution came to be, not end state facts about the current state of the distribution. If all property owned today came either via initial acquisition or free transfer, then the distribution is just, regardless of its inequality.
- (1) How to account for any just violations of liberty? Self-ownership implies full and absolute propety rights. How to account for positive rights to negative liberty (e.g. taxation)? Minor infringements on liberty to alleviate major constraints on others? Everyday behaviors that inevitably put others at risk (e.g. smoking causes pollution)? A theory of maximum equal baseline liberty can account for this. But a self-ownership argument to support this seems ad hoc, and may actually require appealing to maximum baseline liberty. 
- (2) How to account for property in the real world? Nozick states that we have rights to property because we have a right to our bodies, our labor and talents. Thus we have a right to any external resources we gain with the exercise of our talents/labor. But this is conditional on legitimate acquisition of those resources. We can own property by (1) appropriating unowned property contingent on the Lockean proviso, (2) being the recipient of a free transfer of property, or (3) being the recipient of legitimate rectification. The problem is almost none of the property owned today has been justly acquired since it's the result of war, subjugation, oppression, plunder, etc. and the idea of rectifying these unjustices in implausible. If we instead have a system of maximum equal baseline liberty, we can have a just system without dealing with going through history.

## Analysis of political legitimacy & Justice

Can it be reduced to morality? The moral justification of force?

It has to do with justification of state coercion. 

Whether people should have a right to do X cannot reduce to whether X is immoral. Consider the following:
- There are times when X is immoral but people should still have the right to do X. Lying, adultery, cheating in a game with friends, being disloyal, manipulating someone's emotions, being an overall asshole, etc. 
- There are times when X is not immoral but it can be justified to retract someone's right to do X. These are instances where an individual doing X wouldn't be immoral or even bad, but legalizing X would significantly harm the lives of people in society or a particular group in society. Certain forms of racial discrimination, hard drug usage, selling dangerous products, etc. 

It does not reduce to whether it is moral to stop people from doing X. 
- This may handle the above cases, but there are also some exceptions. There are cases where a person should have the right to do X, even though it would be moral to stop him from doing X. And there are cases where a person should not have the right to do X, even though it would be immoral to stop him from doing X.
- It would not be immoral for A to steal from B if it required saving A's life, but B should the right to refuse.
- It would be immoral for B to stop A from getting B's money to save his life, but A should not have that right.
- The distinction is due to the difference between an individual being morally permitted to coerce someone, and the state being permitted to coerce someone. You can have individual permission without state permission, and vice-versa.
- E.g. individual permission without state permission: an individual can kill one person to save themselves. And perhaps an individual can kill one person to save another. But the state cannot kill one to save one. 
- This is because to do so would be to express priority of one person's life to another. The state is supposed to be impartial with regard to the value of its individual citizens. An individual has permission to give priority of his own life over others in situations where one must die, but not the state. The state is supposed to be an impartial judge that can be justified to all citizens.
- E.g. in the other direction: It is justified to tax the rich to fund the education of the poor, but the poor cannot steal from the rich to fund their own education. You might say: this is because of the negative effects of allowing the latter moral principle to govern society, i.e. we would be afraid of being robbed spontaneously, unlike the government which is transparent and predictable. But even if the stealing was transparent and predictable (i.e. say, the church was doing the stealing, and they had their own constitution), it would still be wrong.

## My Theory

1. Individuals should have reasons to follow a moral theory
2. Not just any reason, i.e. ethical egoism is not true. So you can't coerce someone just because it benefits you.
3. Rather, it is reasons with intersubjective justification
4. Individuals have no reason to be coerced/trampled in favor of some other kind of good (i.e. or someone else's good, or utilitarianism)
5. Doesn't mean coercion is never justified. Sometimes it is - e.g. to protect one's property - because it's necessary for a decent life.
6. But protecting property rights is not the only kinds of coercion necessary for a good life. Also, there might be a state, safety net, etc

Main differences with traditional libertarianism
- Property
	- Everyone owns an equal share of the world's raw resources
	- Ccompensation is required when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others *actually attempt to*, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. 
	- Some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they decide on coercive laws.
- Central value
	- Not justified based on self-ownership, 
	- Some sort of entitlement to maximum baseline equal liberty, i.e. everyone entitled to the basic conditions necessary for the exercise of one's capacity to pursue their conception of a good life. 
	- This includes negative liberty e.g. protection from assault, but also positive liberty, e.g. accessibility to basic needs, etc.

Possible critique, the theory doesn't address some obscure issues:
- E.g. the theory doesn't tell us if someone can kill another to save themselves from being paralyzed, if they make someone undergo torture to save their life, etc.
- This is fine because (1) this sort of event never happens, and (2) it is not obvious that there is a right answer to this.
- There are only two reasons that a theory has to address an issue: (1) the issue is something we actually deal with and so we need a right answer, and (2) the issue might not happen but we intuit a strong answer, and so the theory needs to have the right answer. 
- It's okay if the theory says nothing about a case that meets neither of these conditions. In fact, it would be okay if the theory said anything because we are not really sure if it would be right or wrong.

Intuitions:

Why liberty is the only thing that matters
- Imagine a world of fully informed, fully rational agents with maximal equal liberty. How can coercion be justified here? To promote the aims of a particular agent?
- Imagine every possible political/economic system was available to people, and people could make a fully informed, consensual uncoerced decision on where to live. In this case, there can be no justification for coercion, even if that coercion resulted in more equality, utility, etc. So liberty is the primary value, and all other values - e.g. equality, utility, social order, etc. - are pursuable only insofar as they respect the demands of liberty.
- At the very least one has to accept that coercion is prima facie wrong and there needs to be justified exceptions to the rule. What constitutes the exceptions?
Why anarchy is wrong:
- Minor coercion to alleviate minor constraints is justifiable. E.g. taxation to protect people, breaking a fence to save a child.
- A lot of our everyday actions put others at risk. E.g. smoking causes pollution.
- Uninitiated minor/major coercion is justifiable. Coercion against A in self-defense is justified independently of whether A is responsible. E.g. imagine A presents a danger to others, but he is not responsible, but coercing A is the only way to stop the danger.
Why negative rights are wrong:
- Negative rights only are unsustainable. All taxation assumes that people have a positive right to negative liberty. Why not assume a positive right to positive liberty?

Principles I accept:
- Unprompted coercion against A at the benefit of B:
	- Can only be justified when:
		- The burden alleviated from B is great.
		- The burden placed on A is minor.
		- B does not have the opportunity to improve his situation. I.e. either
			- he isn't aware of the actions he can take to improve his situation, or (force is justified for education)
			- there are no actions he can take to alleviate his situation (force is justified for assistance)
	- Intuition:
		- Imagine A and B have equal opportunity to the base requirements.
			- They directly have access to the same amount of raw resources.
			- The are equally aware of the behaviors they can adopt to develop more resources.
			- They would develop the same amount of resources if they performed the same behaviors.
			- They are equally capable of performing these behaviors if they wanted (i.e. they aren't starving)
			- If A decides to dedicate more time/energy into developing his raw resources, B does not deserve any of the excess.
- The scope of the coercion:
	- It must be limited:
		- as small a scope as necessary
		- minimum force required
	- Intuition:
		- We don't fund other nations' governments when they are capable of doing so.
		- Cities don't fund other cities' police, firefighting, education, etc. when they are capable of doing so.
- Instances of coercion against A to benefit B must be democratically elected
	- These principles only show when coercion is justified, not when it is obligatory.
	- If they are not agreed upon, then anarchism is fine.

- Terminology
	- belief + desire = intention
	- ability (internal to agent) + opportunity (external to agent) = capacity 
	- intention + capacity = actualization
	- "constrained" = there is an interference
	- "coercion" = the interference is via another agent.
- Triadic relationship:
	- x is free iff x (an agent) has freedom from y (some interference) in achieving z (some goal).
	- Formal versus Effective freedom concerns which characterizations of y matter. Is an agent free simply if they lack interference from other external agents (formal freedom) or if they lack interference from other agents and non-agent inference, including interference from their lack of abilites or internal characteristics (effective freedom)?
	- A different way of characterizating the relationship:
		- x is free to z iff x (an agent) would achieve z if certain conditions C obtained. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), it is due to failing to meet some condition in C rather than some cause y (y is not in C). If x does not achieve z because of y, then x is not free.
		- Formal Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions, ability, lack of external interferences, etc. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free), this is due to some reason other than agent interference.
		- Maximal Effective Freedom: x is free iff x would achieve z if x had the appropriate intentions. Insofar as x does not achieve z (assuming x is free to z), this is due to some reason other than some interference.
- What counts as x?:
	- Preference vs autonomy?
	- Freedom to do as one wants, or freedom to do as what one would want if they were rational?
	- E.g. rational self vs animal/empirical self
- What sources of interference y?:
	- Internal interferences, external interferences, other agent interferences?
	- Formal liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of agent intereference in seeking z
	- Effective liberty: 
		- [ ] Lack of external/internal interference in seeking z
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities and historical intentions/abilities (i.e. he might not have the capacity to achieve z now, but he is free to z because would be have the capacity to achieve z if he had planned accordingly).
		- [ ] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions/abilities
		- [x] x would z if he had the appropriate present intentions
			- i.e. people don't have a right to these things per se, e.g. food, water. So they can't justify coercing people just because they lack them. Rather they have the right to the opportunity to acquire these goods. E.g. if a person is in a situation where through no fault of their own they are unable to acquire food, they can coerce others to retrieve it. 
		- [ ] Directly providing z (A has z)
	- Qualiification to "intentions". I.e. "x is free to z iff x would z if he had the appropriate intentions and the intentions are of type T"?
		- Any intentions? E.g. We're all free to be successful authors because we would be successful authors if we had the appropriate intentions, e.g. adopted the intentions involved in writing certain words on a piece of paper. But clearly there's a sense in which some are free to be successful authors whereas others are not. 
		- Intentions that we know of. E.g. we're not free to be successful authors because we do not know which intentions to adopt to become successful, even though we would be successful if we adopted those intentions.
		- Intentions that we know of that are not coerced. E.g. if we would be killed if we did z (but there was no interference), then we are not free to do z. Less extremely, if there were severe penalties for doing z (e.g. social ostrasization) for doing z, then we are less free to do it.
		- Intentions devoid of any causal influence. E.g. libertarian free will. No.
- What constitutes "interference"?
	- At the very least, it must be something that plays a causal role in preventing an agent from actualizing an intention.
	- Physical obstacle?
	- Emotional distress?
	- Something in the middle?
		- Loud music, bright lights, etc. are harmful even though they are no more "physical" than disliked music, colors, etc. Why are they special?
		- Because they are harms that bypass an interpretative framework? 
		- Because they are of a higher quantity than other harms?
		- They restrict an agent's aims, independently of their intentions.
	- y is an interference for x achieving z if the following conditions are met:
		- y causes a state of affairs such that x cannot achieve z regardless of his intentions.
			- Too strong? What if y makes it such that x can only achieve z with rather costly intentions?
			- (avoid issues regarding the meaning "causation")
- What kind of z are people entitled to?
	- Any arbitrary aim? Property? Well-being? Suffering? Capacity for self-actualization?
	- Can't be any aim. E.g. you might have the aim that I not be homosexuals.
	- Can't be happiness.
	- Requires a qualitative ranking of what kinds of liberties matter.
	- Things that matters:
		- Basic Needs - food, water, shelter
		- Protection from assault, bodily autonomy
		- Property
		- Occupation?
	- This requires a qualitative, rather than merely quantitative, comparison of liberty tradeoffs. E.g. it might be the case that taxation reduces a rich person's liberty more than it promotes the liberty of a poor person. If you just enumerated all the activities that the rich person is prevented from doing and all the activities that the poor person can now do, it might be that more activities were reduced for the rich. However, this doesn't mean we can't limit the rich person's freedom. What matters is not just the amount of liberty, but the value of the liberty. The poor person is now free to perform more important activities (e.g. afford shelting, healthy food, etc.). Speaking of "overall liberty" when making these tradeoffs is a red herring.
- Function: how to respect liberty?
	- Simple Consequentialist? 
		- E.g. Maximize sum, maximize average, maximize worse-off, minimize number of people below a threshold? 
		- Maybe minimize number of people below a threshold, but no to the maximizing options.
	- Simple Deontologist? Never restrict or limit? 
		- E.g. Self-ownership, from which we extend property rights
		- No. Too strong. Leads to anarchism
	- Hierarchical Deontology? Possibly
		- Not consequentialist because:
			- People are permitted to harm others to save themselves, even if this makes a worse state of affairs. 
			- Our duties are not to aim towards some ideal state of affairs.
			- Agent-relative
			- Not aggregative
		- Create a ranked order of constraints on liberty, e.g. type 0, type 1, type 2, etc.
			- Type 0 are most important, e.g. constraints on life, movement, etc. (this does not include significant emotional harm, e.g. seeing what you perceive to be a sin, because there could be a norm whereby that harm is diminished). These are features that can limit a person independently of their intentions.
			- Type 0 violations are permitted to prevent other type 0 constraints
			- For all i, type i violations are permitted to prevent type j (where j< i) constraints
			- Constraints of different types are not commensurate
			- Type 0 = basic needs
			- Type 1 = bodily autonomy 
			- Type 2 = property
		- Who is causally responsible for the constraints to A?
			-> If B is responsible, B is required to assist and A permitted to use force. The state is justified in coercing B.
			-> If A is responsible, A is not permitted to use force. The state is not justified in coercing B.
			-> Otherwise, (no one is responsible)
				-> If there's a reasonable way to alleviate the constraint on A without constraining B,
					- that route must be chosen
				-> Otherwise, A is permitted to use force, and B is permitted to resist. A conflict has occurred. 
					- If the harms to A and infringement to B are comparable (e.g. A must kill B to stay alive), the state cannot coerce B. The state must be impartial.
					- Otherwise, if the harms to A are major and the infringement to B are minor (e.g. tax B to educate A), the state can coerce B. The state is remaining impartial; A is given priority not because A happens to be A, but because of the stronger burden on B. B is still permitted to resist.
		- Threshold
			- Concerns what the state can do.
			- There is some base level threshold of freedom. The state is justified in enacting coercion M to group A in order to help group B, so long as (1) A is above the threshold, (2) B is below the threshold, (3) M does not leave individuals in A below the threshold, (4) M brings individuals in B above the threshold.
			- There might be multiple thresholds. Today, that threshold might involve something like public education, healthcare, police force, etc. Hypothetically, it could also involve saving people from torture. We might be able to force those in A to save those in B from being tortured, even if it subjects those in A to poor education, policing, etc. Or maybe there's a single threshold and if everyone is forced to be under it, there are no moral standards.
			- Insofar as the individuals in A are responsible for B being worse-off, they are obligated to assist in this.
			- Insofar as the individuals in B are not responsible, they are permitted to resist (even though the state is still justified to use force).
			- When coercion is permissible
				- If everyone is above the threshold, coercion is never permissible.
				- If everyone is below the threshold, and there's no way for an individual to get above the threshold without preventing someone else frmo going above it, then coercion is always permissible. There's just a conflict. Although it might be that justification and permissibility are concepts that don't really apply (e.g. in the state of nature).

### Justified uses of coercion

Equality -> Liberty (when access to comparably opportunity doesn't conflict) + Democracy (when access to comparably opportunity conflicts) -> government that (1) protects/develops capacities necessary to participant in a democratic political system, (2) both protects and does not infringe upon certain specific basic liberties which do involve relevant conflicts with the opportunity of others (e.g. access to abortion), and (3) leaves the rest up to decentralized democratic support. Can be summed up as minarchism + decentralized democracy

Idealization
- What kind of world do fully informed, fully rational individuals prefer to live in?
- How to move from equality to minarchism + decentralized democracy. Equality is valued in itself on principle. Minarchism, democracy and decentralization are valued based on various empirical facts (e.g. a benevolent dictator would be okay if it were possible). What is a test for what we value in principle? How to articulate what equality truly consists in? E.g. can it be articulated via some ideal procedure such as e.g. Rawl's veil of ignorance.

Key points:
- "Major" hindrances to freedom (i.e. acts of assault, imprisonment, death, etc.) are justified only to prevent other "major" hindrances to freedom (idea from Kant). Fully informed, fully rational parties with equal opportunity are not allowed to aggress one another, even for some overall increase in utility. This is consistent with basic self-defense allowed under anarcho-capitalism.
- Victim-defensed based permissions. If X is justified in coercing/aggressing Y in self-defense when Y is the criminal, X is also justified in aggressing/coercing Z in self-defense when Z is innocent. 
- Third-party protection. If X is justified in coercing/aggressing Y in self-defense, then X is also justified in coercing/aggressing Y to protect third-party Z. Defense-based protections + third-party protections justifies mandated taxation protecting everyone's negative freedom allowed under minarchism.
- Positive freedom is what matters, not negative freedom. This justifies the kind of minarchism + limited, decentralized democracy that I support.
-> This acually is not sufficient. Imagine a government decides to kill members of a minority group to save the lives of 5 members of a majority group (e.g. kidney donation). It may also have democratic appeal (since the beneficaries are in the majority). This can satisfy the above conditions, but it does not seem just. Some ways to account for this intuition while accomodating state coercion generally:
	- The state is justified in *threatening* to use assault or forcibly confiscating innocent's resources to save the lives of others, but they are not justified in *actually* assaulting innocents.
	- The individuals in the dire situations in the majority group may be permitted to kill the members of the minority (for the same reasons an individual can take the last piece of food to save his life even if it kills others), but that doesn't mean the state is.
	- All members need some reason to respect the policy.

Central principle:
- Major physical coercion is not justified with fully infomed, fully rational individuals with no conflicts in opportunity. I.e. if A and B have equal material opportunity, A cannot physically coerce B because it pleases him or satisfies an interest for him or provides utility.
- It might be justified with "minor" physical coercion, but not physical coercion by the state (where imprisonment and death are risks).
- Physical coercion is only justified to reduce other instances of physical coercion (or in cases of lack of information or rationality). The question, then, is what additional features must be present for physical coercion to be just. The principle seems to be as follows: physical coercion against X is justified only if it is necessary to reduce comparable or more physical coercion against Y. 
- Instead of saying, "coercion is justified when necessary to alleviate other coercion", we might accept a threshold level of opportunity, above which it is not justified to coerce others.
- Aggregation of burdens doesn't matter; it's an individual patient-centered deontological moral system.
- Individual permissions 
	- Individuals are permitted to freely form contracts without outside interference.
	- Or, rather, the contracts that they would form if they were fully informed, fully rational, etc.
	- Individuals can apply force to others if the other person is impaired.
	- Individuals can force others to compensate for actions that undermined contract-formation (e.g. theft, violence, etc.).
	- Individuals can defend themselves via force.
- State power: 
	- Optional democratic uses of state coercion: 
		- Unwanted externalities *due to* contracts can be prevented. e.g. unwanted systems which would be incentivized by everyone's incentivized contracts. This is only if the restrictions caused by this prevention is comparable to the restriction that would be caused if left to the market. If so, this should be decided democratically. Individuals can produce preferred systems that cannot be secured via contracts. People in a region have shared preferences, but cannot be satisfied without the use of state power within that region.
		- Arbitrary communal preferences:
			- (1) There is democratic support.
			- (2) The state coercion impairs minor constraint to reduce a comparable or larger constraint.
			- (3) State coercion is the only way to alleviate these constraints.
			- (4) The scope of the state coercion is as small as logistically feasible
			-> This not sufficient? See example where a majority votes to distribute organs from a minority to members of a majority who need them.
	- Non-democratic uses of state coercion:
		- Subsidizing the basic requirements for ensuring everyone's values are input in the democratic system:
			- Courts, Police, Military, Prison, Education
		- Protections: protections against constraints when another person is causally responsible.
		- (?) Compensation to individuals made worse-off by state activity - e.g. people who are made worse-off by state enforcement of property rights.
	- Justification for property rights?

- Consent: 
	- Explicit
	- Implicit
		- A implicitly suggests that they desire F (e.g. cues in romantic situations).
		- A doesn't desire F, but they engage in an informal agreement that clearly indicated that F would be done to them (honor cultures, gangs, etc.). A implicit agrees to F iff they perform a behavior X whereby:
			- There is a clear standard that F is the consequence for X,
			- Performing X is optional, and they are not coerced into doing X.
	- Revoked
		- E.g. to enforce contracts
- Impairment: 
	- Lack of rationality
	- Lack of information
	- Maybe this isn't sufficient, maybe we also need A to prefer to be coerced under the condition that they are irrational/uninformed; otherwise, this force may not be permissible
- Rectification: Compensation for constraints imposed
	- Past physical damages
	- Excess resource usage AND others attempt to access their fair share but are prevented
	- Mandated safety nets in societies where a person is worse-off due to the presence of a state or economic system.
- Forced Compensation: taking someone's resources and compensating them, only if:
	- The portion taken is too small to cause large harm to the person's interests (e.g. in taxation)
	- The person is compensated for the transaction in the same resources
	- E.g. taxation to support welfare. If we didn't, we would have to pay for prisons, etc. Of course, this needs to be balanced against creating poor incentives for unfit reproduction.
- The preconditions for basic democracy don't require democratic support
	- Assuming they *did* have democratic support, we would still need these in place to know if they had democratic support.
	- Courts, Voting Infrastructure
	- Monopoly on force to prevent agencies from suppressing others expression using force
	- Education
		- Otherwise, people might not know they have the right to vote
		- They might not know what's good for them
		- They might be coerced non-violently by others 
	- The goal is to make sure everyone's interests are taken into consideration during voting, not to make sure everyone has equal opportunity to a good life. Not sure if this covers food, healthcare, etc.
	- Don't require democratic support.
	- Should be provided at as local a level as possible. E.g. local police departments, education, etc. Broader governments steps in to administrate or bring local governments up to competence, but the broader government doesn't directly fulfill the role (i.e. by directly providing the required services)
	- Examples: 
		- Minarchism: directly providing police, military, courts, prisons, education
		- Possibly: providing opportunity to food, healthcare, etc. Note it's providing *opportunity* not necessarily the resources directly. I.e. set up systems such that people *would* attain food, healthcare, etc. if they had the appropriate intentions. 
- Protection against other constraints
	- NOTE: this is considering minor constraints vs major constraints; but remember state government intervention isn't necessarily minor because they are always backed with the threat of imprisonment, physical assault or even death if someone retaliates.
	- Whether current or future (i.e. pre-emptive protection is justified).
	- This extends beyond mere requirements for a democratic society. It applies to constraints generally, even non-intentional and non-agential.
	- When considering whether to force A to assist B.
	- Ways that A can be responsible for B's diminished liberty.
		- R1: A *intended* B being worse-off. E.g. taking someone's water. 
		- R2: A didn't *intend*, but his actions did *cause* B to be worse-off. i.e. if A stopped performing his actions, B would not be poor. E.g. owning the entire water supply.
		- R3: A didn't *cause*, but it is not possible to alleviate B's condition with A's current behavior. i.e. if A stopped performing his actions, B would still be poor; nevertheless, the only way to improve B's situation is by coercing A. E.g. A has opportunity to water but doesn't know how to utilize it without education.
	- If A is causally responsible for B's diminished liberty (R1 or R2),
		- The state is obligated to force A.
		- B permitted to force.
		- A obligated to assist.
	- Should this actually be democratically endorsed?  
	- Examples of protection. Protect against:
		- Physical coercion, 
		- Excess resource usage,
		- Non-agent caused constraints 
	- Examples: fire
- Arbitrary (non-economic) communal preferences
	- Doesn't have to be based on contracts.
	- There is no causal responsibility.
	- When a community has preferences which might conflict with the preferences of others.
	- There are two kinds of conflicts:
		- Conflicts with preferences of individuals within the community
			- The community's preferences can be acted upon assuming:
				- (1) There is widespread support. The amount of support required depends on the trade-off of harms by enacting the preferences versus not enacting the preferences. 
				- (2) If the harms are comparable or the harm to the coerced/taxed is less than the harm that would be to the beneficiary, then we just go with the majority opinion. Otherwise, ???
				- (3) The restriction is the only way to alleviate the other restrictions (R3 from above).
				- (4) The decisions could not feasibly be made on a more local level.
		- Conflicts with preferences of groups outside of the community
			- The preferences can be acted upon assuming groups outside of the group have equal opportunity to accomplish those same preferences
			- E.g. restrictive immigration don't coerce those outside the group, so its fine
	- Perhaps this is how we set standards for property rights / resource usage?
- Unwanted Economic Externalities
	- Justification
		- The justification here is different from the justification for protection. 
		- I.e. it doesn't matter that it is a minor constraint to alleviate major restrictions. even if applying minor constraints to alleviate minor constraints is not generally justifiable, it's justifiable in this case because of its contractual nature. Contracts only get their validity from consensual support.
		- It also doesn't need to be the only way to alleviate a constraint.
	- Requirements:
		- Most people in a region prefer the opportunities to form contracts with features X
		- Most people are incentivized such that their actions in the market make it impossible for contracts of feature X to succeed
		- Thus, people's choices in a free makert are not expressions of their preferred contract system
		- People can express their contract preferences via voting
		- Note that the competing harms here are identical, e.g. people being restricted due to the free market versus the voting system.
		- Not that this applies to deciding how contracts are formed, not necessarily other preferred systems (e.g. this doesn't apply to whether people prefer gay people to be around). Why contracts?
			- (1) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, then contracts of type not-X would be disincentenvized from existing.
			- (2) If everyone in a free market acted to incentivize contracts of type X, this would not be an unjust restriction on employees/employers who prefer contracts of type not-X. 
			- (3) Whether an employer/employee is restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of free market versus forces of the political system does not influence the *personal harm* that this places on those employees/employers. Harm here is measured in their opportunity to satisfy their preferences.
			- (4) Whether a political/economic system is just supervenes on the harm it places on people.
			- (5) [1 and 2] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to free market actions, then this would not be an unjust restrictions on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
			- (6) [3 and 4] Whether people are restricted from engaging in contracts of type not-X due to forces of the free market versus the political system is not relevant to whether they are treated justly.
			- (7) [5 and 6] if contracts of type not-X are disincentivized from existing due to a voting system, then this would not be an unjust restriction on those who preferred contracts of type not-X.
		- This does not work for things like wanting there to be no gay people because the 2nd permise wouldn't pass through. E.g. if everyone in a free makret acted to incentivize killing gay people, this WOULD be an unjust restriction on gay people.s
	- Example: workplace benefits, regulations, etc. 
		- Most employees in a region would prefer mandated time off from their employers if they were fully informed, fully rational and had the power to unilaterally decide what kind of system to live in.
		- However, most employees are incentivized to go to companies that do not provide benefits because these companies tend to be more successful because they are more economically efficient.
		- What about the employees who prefer companies that do not provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by restricting their opportunities? 
			- It is the same restriction that one would feel if either they preferred a style of company that offerred benefits but the market didn't incentivize it. 
			- Thus, without these regulations, people who preferred these regulations would feel the same restrictions in the opposite direction. So the restrictions are equivalent and we should side with whatever is democratically decided. The only difference is one is decided by individuals via their choices in the market, and the other is decided by individuals via their voting preferences. The mechanism imposing the restriction is different, but the restriction *on the minority employees/employees* is identical.
			- It might be argued that the restrictions are different, because in a regulated system there will be *no* companies without these benefits. Whereas in a free system, there would still be *some* companies with those benefits, but people would be incentivized against going there so they would be less successful/frequent. Two responses: (1) the hypothetical was that the free system was such that there are *no* viable, successful companies with benefits in a free market. In which case, the restrictions would be equivalent. (2) if it is the case that there would be some viable successful companies with benefits in a free market but they would be a bit less efficient and so less frequent, then it is not just to force all companies to offer benefits. However, it is just to manipulate taxation such that companies with benefits are at no disadvantage. Assuming the only unwanted externality of the free market as that one's preferred company receives less income (i.e. assuming that's the only reason why people are individually incentivized to perpetuate a system that they don't want), then this will be sufficient regulation and no more is justified. 
		- Okay, employees are not forced any more than in a free market. What about the employers who do not want to provide benefits? Aren't we forcing them by not even allowing them to open up their business?
			- See above. The same answers apply.
	- Similar examlpes:
		- Workplace benefits, regulations, etc.
		- Large business undercutting small businesses with low profit margins
		- Theft?
	- When local preferences does not match global preferences
		- I.e. when a person wants system X but they are individually incentivized to perform actions that lead to system Y, because their actions (in an unconstrained free market) only affect their individual benefits, rather than the system as a whole. 
		- Prisoner dillemma, e.g. a company's existence makes everyone's lives worse (e.g. automates all jobs) but no individual has the economic ability to outcompete it (because the larger company's products are all uncompetitively cheap) due to no individual having the incentive to purchase from a different company. 
		- ^ Similar justification as the argument for implementing private property over communally owned resources. E.g. avoids the tragedy of the commons. 

Questions:
- How to establish a theory of property rights? Is it decided democratically?
- Threshold instead of major vs minor?
	- Specify a threshold of positive freedom that we're all entitled to
		- E.g. includes access to equal share of resources
		- Ability to make informed, rational choices about how to live one's life
		- Etc.
	- People above the threshold can be taxed to bring others above the threshold, so long as it doesn't bring anyone below it.
- Enacting major constraints to alleviate major constraints?
	- The state is not permitted to do this???
	- Individuals are permitted to do this
- Enacting minor constraints to alleviate minor constraints?
	- If there is democratic support?
	- What are some examples that don't fall into the contractual case mentioned above?
	- Taxing the rich to make the poor better off? No, unless the poor are worse-off *because* of restricted opportunities *because* either (1) the rich are rich or (2) of the current state or economic system.
	- Okay, what if the poor don't have the opportunity to become rich (minor constraint). Can they then impose a minor constraint on the rich via redistribution? (1) this wouldn't solve the issue because you can't make all of the poor rich via taxation (at least not without making the rich poor in the process). At best you could make the moderately better off, which leads to (2). (2) The poor probably do have the opportunity to become moderately better off. If they do not, then redistribution (not necessarily via handouts, but subsidized education, etc.) can be provided to account for this. But then, is this really a minor constraint on the poor? This could be major. In the end redistribution for the sake of reducing inequality is unjustified. 
	- Does laws against slander/libel count as minor constraints to alleviate major constraints? What about subsidizing laws against petty theft? Is it because the effects of not having a law against these actions would result in major constraints?
- How to handle state failures?
	- Either due to incompetence or mallace, a state fails to provide individuals with certain opportunities.
	- Do other sibling states or parent states have permission/obligation to intervene to provide individuals with opportunity?
	- They have the permission, but not the obligation. It depends on the democratic support of the other/broader society.
	- The intervention should be minor/temporary to bring the minor states up to a level of competence, rather than *merely* directly providing the resources/goods to the citizens.

### Bodily Autonomy

Below discusses property rights, but also need to flesh out rights to self-ownership and bodily autonomy.
I don't endorse full self-ownership or bodily autonomy.
Bodily autonomy can be violated whenever (even assuming the other agent is perfectly innocent, has not infringed anyone else's rights):
1. The constraints on bodily autonomy are minor relative to the constraints it will prevent, and such coercion is the only reasonable way to alleviate major constraints on others. The state and private individuals can infringe upon bodily autonomy in this case.
2. The constraint is comparable to the constraint that the victim would otherwise face. E.g. steal from one person to prevent another from stealing from you, kill a person to save your life. These are justified by private individuals, but not the state (the state can't give priority to one life over another; the state must be impartial). Are they even justified by private individuals?

### Equal Share Libertarianism

Note: Erase this section?

Note: might wanna change "values/interests" to "material opportunity". Because:
1. cases of compensation are not focused per se on increasing the welfare of the agents, but on compensating for their lost negative liberty; 
2. people are free to form more substantive communal laws not because this necessarily increases their welfare, but because not allowing them to do that (and forcing them to live in a libertarian society) deprives them of some negative liberty.

My theory does not prioritize self-ownership in the sense that people should necessarily have full control over their bodies (and therefore property). 
Rather, I prioritize the values/interests of individuals. 
I believe that an individual's values/interests cannot be significantly suppressed/limited in promotion of someone else's values/interests. 
Note that supressing/limiting values/interests is not the same as controlling one's body. 
There may be instances where controlling one's body does not significantly suppress/limit their values/interests, or even where controlling one's body actually promotes their values/interests. 
This means that, under special circumstances, others can control A's body against A's will, but only it is in the promotion of A's interests or values. 

### Equal Share + Communal Property

Equal-share libertarianism is probably a close approximation of my own view. 
If I were to try to modify this conception to be in agreement with my view, it would have the following caveats: 

Note that "local community" means "more local than the global community", so a country counts as a "local community".

1. Rather than compensation being required whenever one uses/appropriates more than their per capita share, compensation is required in a local community when an initial agent uses/appropriates so much that others *actually attempt to*, but are prevented from, attaining an equal share as the initial agent. 
	- Examples of those forced to compensate
		- Monopolies that own all the resources. Individual companies physically hogging resources.
		- Economic societies as a whole that materially value only certain traits, e.g. certain cognitive ability (under capitalism), certain race (under racist capatilistic society), etc.; people without these characteristics cannot have a decent life. People who benefit from a system must compensate those who were harmed by the system.
	- Examples of compensation
		- Redistribution
		- Safety nets: disability, unemployment
		- Anti-discrimination laws
2. Some sort of communal property is possible. People can join together and form communities where they own all the property within that community amongst themselves (which includes SOME control over the bodies of the individuals living there). 
	- These are optional, democratic choices from local communities for a way of life. The extent to which people can then enforce more positive, substantive laws, is based on the extent to which there is:
		- Less restrictions the coerced:
			- The limitations on the persons are minimized 
			- There is agreement in values within the community
			- People are free to exit the community, 
			- There is sufficient equal valuable resources outside of the community, 
		- More value to the benefactors:
			- These laws have significant effects on the liberty of those in the community.
			- It is infeasible to achieve the same effect by enforcing laws on a smaller scale.
	- These are almost always justified by enacting minor confiscation of the property of others (i.e. taxation, regulation, etc.) in order to prevent significant, material harms to others (i.e. assault, sickness, death, un-education,  etc.):
		- Borders/Military
		- Police
		- Courts
		- Firefighting 
		- Education
		- Food/drug regulation
		- Certain anti-discrimination laws (if the harm is material disadvantage, not psychological pain of seeing racism).
		- Healthcare

- Other attempts to justify the state - i.e. non-consensual use of force against fully informed, fully rational agents that is not based on rectification/compensation. Other libertarian arguments cannot do this:
	- *Right to avoid risk*. People have a right to avoid risky situations. Anyone who refrains from supporting a state commits a rights violations as this would make life risky for everyone else. Therefore, a state is justified to prevent rights violations against those who refuse to support it. 
		- Counter: This is a bad argument because we have a negative right to avoid threats that are direct and immediate and so we can coerce anyone who makes such threats insofar as they advance such threats. But this doesn't justify coercing taxpayers to support a state because they need not to have violating anyone's rights violations.
	- *Right to law.* People have a right to have their right to liberty, life, etc. codified in a body of law. But why though?
	- *Samariton rights*. People have a right to violate others' right to property when doing so is needed to escape dire circumstances. E.g. someone lost in a snow blizzard has a right to break into someone else's cabin to save themselves. This may be valid, but it invokes positive rights which is not in the spirit of libertarianism. 
		- This, however, may be prferrable because it can justify, e.g., a police force even when the majority of people do not consent to it under a democratic system. There is guaranteed harm in the state of nature. It would lead to widespread rights violations to people. There are two points needed to support this: 
			1. People have a right to pre-emptively use force to protect themselves from these probable future rights violations by specific individual.
			2. People have a right to pre-emptively use force to protect themselves from probable future rights violations by a general group even if we don't know which specific individuals in the group will perform the rights violations. This can guarantee the following protection regardless of democratic agreements (1) Borders/Military, (2) Police, and (3) Courts. Two questions
				1. If taxpayers have a positive duty to protect individuals' negative liberty, why don't they also have a positive duty to protect individuals' postive liberty? It seems that whether someone is harmed because of another agent versus a non-agent has no implication on the relationship between taxpayers and the victims. This may justify Firefighters, healthcare, etc. 
				2. Why doesn't this extend across the entire planet? For example, we don't have a duty to protect those in Africa from rights violations. Maybe this: people have the right to use the minimal force necessary to protect themselves from rights violations.

### Disagreement

Broader laws are mandatory, non-negotiable. Local laws are decided democratically. Note also that the broader laws tend to be more libertarian whereas the local laws have the potential to be more authoritarian. In principle, the broader laws could be more authoritarian in different countries where there is homogenous culture where everyone agrees to some authoritarian rules. 

Perhaps, the ideal laws for a given region are simply the upshot of norms of the culture of that region. For homogenous societies, they are free to enforce whatever rules they prefer. However, when a region has a large diversity of opinion, then the range of acceptable laws narrows. The ideal laws for a region are the laws that it would be rational for that region to accept. However, if the views of a region are so diverse, then the only laws that it would be rational for a region to accept would be minimal libertarian laws that emphasized freedom and liberty. Laws regulating international affairs are the extreme of this: the only international laws there are are basic respect for the sovereignty of nations, protection from genocide, etc.

Coercive laws for members of group G are justified if and only if such laws would be approved of by fully informed and fully rational members of group G assuming they sought coercive laws to regulate behavior. A law is appropriate for group G only if it is the upshot of ideal social construction. When there is broad disagreement, the only laws that overlap with everyone's fully rational interest would be minimal libertarian laws.

Must explain the relationship between disagreement and ideal socially constructed norms in a way that explains:
1. That widespread disagreement implies that minarchism.
2. That minimal, but existent, disagreement does not imply minarchism.

### Justified coercion by region

Global
- Basically anarchism.
- Respect for the sovereignty of other countries.
- Retaliation against those that violate the sovereignty.
Diverse community (e.g. U.S.). All above plus
- Minarchism
- Military
- Courts for federal laws
- Police to enforce federal laws
- Food/drug regulation
- Compensation for monopolies
	- Redistribution
- Compensation for societal disadvantage
	- Safety nets: low cognitive functioning, disability, unemployment
	- Anti-discrimination laws
Homogeneous community (e.g. US state/city or European countries). Any of these could be valued (could even be minarchist). All above plus
- Courts for local laws
- Police to enforce local laws
- Firefighters
- Education
- Healthcare

### By Contemporary Politics

Left-Leaning:

- Abortion
    - No restrictions
- Criminal justice
    - Rehabilitation and safety
    - Decriminalize drugs, don't legalize
	- Not retribution. Consider the cases:
		- Agent is morally evil but no longer a threat.
			- Has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed (not rehabilitated). He experiences no suffering. Should we still inflict harm?
		- Agent is a threat but not morally good. 
			- He should be rehabilitated, expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed. Doesn't matter whether this is due to moral corruption or uncontrollable circumstances.
		- Agent is neither morally bad or a threat.
			- Has been rehabilitated.
		- We can agree that if an agent has been expelled, restrained, incapacitated or killed, then we shouldn't inflict suffering. Why is this not also true if he's been rehabilitated.
- Gay marriage
    - Government shouldn't be involved in marriage.
    - If they are, then it should not discriminate based on sex.
- Subsidized Loans
    - Only awarded to those likely to repay them (based on e.g. test scores, grades, etc.)
    - Only have to be paid off after acquiring a certain income level
- Subsidized Healthcare
    - Maybe, if its effective.

Right-Leaning:

- Free Speech
	- Hate Speech allowed
	- Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Nazi Germany)
- Freedom of Association
	- Including discrimination
    - Not inherently wrong
    - Wrong if its arbitrary and exclusionary (rather than balancing)
    - Can be outlawed to prevent systematic subjugation (e.g. Racist USA)
- Affirmative Action
    - Ineffective insofar as it admits students of low standards
    - Don't care otherwise
- Welfare 
    - Provide a means of living for the poor
    - Maybe enough for a limited number of children
    - Don't incentivize unlimited reproduction for the unfit
- Immigration
    - We have the right to any restrictions
    - We should filter in-demand immigrants that can't be filled by natives
    - I desire low influx of immigrants

Other:

- Gun Control
	- Don't care
- Education 
    - Make impractical subjects optional
    - Less encouragement for college
    - Add practical skills
    - Add values.

Very Important:
- Abortion
- Immigration
- Welfare
- Free Speech
- Freedom of Association
- Rehabalitive Justice

Justifications for state coercion:
- Assume the state can do nothing. I.e. there is no state
- For any candidate coercive power to give to the state, the following conditions must be met: 
	- The scope of coercion for some end can only be as expansive as is necessary to achieve the end (e.g. even policing).
	- The coercion itself must be supported by the people. E.g. even police forces should be optional.
	- One of the following:
		- It must be minor coercive constraints to alleviate major constraints
		- Place regulations on contract-formation when collectively we decide that we prefer contracts to be made under certain terms (as opposed to forcing individuals to negotiate with large companies). E.g. Minimum wage, mandated benefits, etc.
		- Restrict the autonomy of people who violate the autonomy of others, or who violate the basic standards required for autonomy. E.g. violent crime, theft. This isn't met under "coercive constraints to alleviate major constraints", e.g. imagine someone poor stole from someone rich.
