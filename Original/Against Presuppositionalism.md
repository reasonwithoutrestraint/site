### Re-using arguments: establishing common ground

- Suspicious Arguments for God:
    - Reasoning methods to prevent infinite regress:
        - (circular reasoning) -> God exists
        - (presuppositionalism) -> God exists
    - Mechanisms to acquire said knowledge
        - (innate knowledge) -> God exists
        - (revelation) -> God exists
        
Exact same arguments can be levied for laws of logic:
    - Reasoning methods to prevent infinite regress:
        - (circular reasoning) -> Laws of Logic Exist
        - (presuppositionalism) -> Laws of Logic Exist
    - Mechanisms to acquire said knowledge
        - (innate knowledge) -> Laws of Logic Exist
        - (revelation) -> Laws of Logic Exist

Deny circular reasoning.
Deny presuppositionalism in its current form (as a representation of external properties)
Accept presuppositionalism in a different form (as an inevitable construction of human reasoning)

### Against using God as the starting point:

- Against the presuppositionalist argument for God: 
    - Epistemological Euthyphro problem - two options:
        1. (blah blah blah) -> God exists -> (blah blah blah) -> The Laws of Logic
        2. Laws of Logic -> (blah blah blah) -> God exists -> (blah blah blah)
    - Problems:
        1. If (1), then everything learned prior to the Laws of Logic could simultaneously be false.
        2. If (2), we can come to learn about the laws of logic prior to anything else. In that case, I'm doing the exact same thing.

- Against circular reasoning argument:
    - Fuck circular reasoning!
    - It can justify anything.

### For using the laws of logic as a starting point:

- Other non-suspicious arguments for Laws of Logic:
    - Constructions of language: They are constructions of language, just like definitions are constructions of language. We construct, rather than discover, the laws of logic. It makes no sense to use our language and ask about whether its possible for a triangle to be square. That's not what it means for something to be a square/triangle. Likewise, it makes no sense to use our language to ask about whether the laws of logic are necessary. What it means for something to be a law of logic is that it is necessary. It's a nonsensical question. Necessity and laws of logic are conceptually entangled. If some other language meant something differently by logic and necessity, then, under their language, they would not be in error.
    - Constructions of reason: They are not merely constructions of language, but also constructions of reason. We construct, rather than discover, the laws of logic. Insofar as we reason, we are compelled to obey the laws of logic. The entire conversation about the laws of logic depends upon the laws of logic. If some other form of information processing worked differently, then, under that information processing, they would not be in error (if they even had conceptions of error).
    - Constraint of reason: We cannot choose not to obey the laws of logic. They are unavoidable, so that's why we do it. Asking how we're justified in obeying the laws of logic is like asking how we're justified in not going faster than the speed of light. I couldn't choose to do so even if I wanted to. I don't even know what it means for something to not follow the laws of logic. I cannot conceive of doing otherwise. If some other form of information processing did not have that constraint, then, under that form of information processing, it would not be in error. 
    - Constructing the laws of logic comes prior to truth. Part of what it means for something to be true/accurate depends on us having constructed an idea of logic in the first place. So we cannot question the truth of the logical laws.

### Constructivists arguments for other forms of reasoning:

- Inductive reasoning (similar to constructivist arguments above)
    - Constructions of language: part of what it means for something to be justified is that it is inductively justified.
    - Constructions/constraints of (human) reason: humans cannot choose to reason without induction. Other creatures might be able to choose to do so. And for them, they would not be unjustified in any way.

- Other assumptions:
    - External reality
    - Causal relations
    - Reliability of perceptions/memories
    - Don't have to believe in them per se. But they are unavoidable models for how we make sense of the word.
