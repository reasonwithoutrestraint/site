### Against Analytic Reductionism

*Open Question Argument*. When one philosopher asserts that "good *means* pleasure" and another asserts that "good *means* desired", there are two different things that they might mean. Firstly, they might be advancing opposing definitions. Thus, their disagremeent can be summarized by them both saying that pleasure is not identical to that which is desired. If the debate is over definitions, it is impossible to (dis)prove any particular definition as definitions are constructed phenomena, nor would any stipulated definitions have any ethical implications. Secondly, they might be saying that most people use "good" to refer to pleasurable or desired things. But this, again, has no ethical implications and is not informative. The point of ethics is to determine what people ought to do, but this goal cannot be accomplished by determining that such and such word is used by most people to express such and such ideas. *No linguistic analysis of a definition can ever provide a reason for someone to do anything.* Not only does it have no ethical implications, it is also not informative: when people say "pleasure is good", this cannot be equivalent to a meaningless analytic claim such as "pleasure is pleasure" or "good is good", as they seem to be saying a synthetic claim which is something more than that. They think people are mistaken and not just making a linguistic mistake. Indeed, the statement "pleasure is good" can be a meaningful and important synthetic claim only if "good" does not mean the same thing as "pleasure". 

Response: non-trivial analytic analysis

*Insistence on normative language*. If normative term N really meant natural term M, then why not carry on making claims about M? If the thesis were true, this would be equivalent to making claims about N, so there should be no difference. The fact that one chooses not to do so implies either (1) he believes that there really is something about N not captured in M, or (2) he believes that society believes that there is something about N not captured in M. Either way, either he or society believes that N and M are not analytically equivalent.

*Intra-linguistic Disagreement Argument*. Definitions are purely subjective. They are ascriptions of arbitrary utterances and symbols to particular concepts or objects in the world. They are appropriate only to the extent that they are supported by a particular linguistic community. Two groups can form separate linguistic communities with different definitions of moral terms, and we wouldn't say that one of the communities were *linguistically* incorrect or mistaken. For example, imagine another linguistic community that was linguistically identical to our own except that their moral terms were switched, i.e. 'good' in their society referred to what we refer to as 'bad' in our society, and so forth. Let's also say that they acted in ways that promoted what they considered to be 'good'. It seems like it is *intelligible* for us to say that they are mistaken in their behavior. But in this case, their mistake cannot be attributed to a linguistic mistake. Instead, their mistake must be attributed to a mistaken action. This reveals that analytic reductionism ignores the conceptual link between moral judgments/facts and motivation/reason to act. The problem is that no *contingently* given linguistic structures can necessarily explain motivation/reason to action in the way that terms like 'good' seem to. Note that if this conceptual link was not present, it would not be intelligible to say that their society was mistaken (e.g. we don't think the French are mistaken just because they use the term 'grape' to refer to what we mean by 'raisin' and use 'raisin' to refer to what we mean by 'grape'). This argument should also be used against analytic non-natural reductionism and perhaps even some forms of synthetic naturalism that are focused on finding what referrents track or guide our *linguistic* use of moral terms.

*Translation Argument*. Imagine we wanted to translate another culture's language to our own. When translating our normative terms, we would be skeptical to attribute to them any normative terms if those terms did not usually accompany the corresponding motivation. This argument should also be used against analytic non-natural reductionism and perhaps even some forms of synthetic naturalism that are focused on finding what referrents track or guide our *linguistic* use of moral terms.

### Against Synthetic Reductionism

*A Priori Argument*. It seems we can come to learn about normative truths a priori. This is inexplicable if there is an a posteriori synthetic relationship between normative facts and non-normative facts. I.e. we cannot learn a priori that yellow is such and such wavelength, or that water is H2O. Yet how can it be the case that we can learn a priori than, e.g. some natural property *necessarily* co-instantiates a normative property? 

*Plattitudes Argument*. Synthetic identities can be found in other domains because we can find trivial essential characteristics of the entites described, e.g. water or yellow. But the only essential characteristics of normative judgments are motivational force.

### Subjectivist Reductionism

*Disagreement Argument*. (for theories that analyze moral terms). When two people disagree about whether X is good, they aren't necessarily disagreeing.

*Unaccounted Global Normativity*. (for ideal observer theories). They can account for prudential rationality, but not epistemic rationality.

### Objectivist Reductionism

*Motivational Argument*. Attributions of goodness to P appear to have a conceptual link with the guidance of action towards promoting P (judgment internalism). For any naturalistic property R, we can imagine clear-headed beings who would fail to find appropriate reason or motive to action in the mere fact that R obtains regarding P. The fact that attributions of goodness are *necessarily* action-guiding whereas attributions of R are only *contingently* action-guiding suggests that goodness and R are not analytically equivalent. The naturalist can respond by rejecting judgment internalism or rejecting analytic naturalism in favor of synthetic naturalism (or maintaining that some naturalistic properites *are* intrinsically motivating, which seems strange). This argument should also be used against analytic non-natural reductionism and perhaps even some forms of synthetic naturalism that are focused on finding what referrents track or guide our *linguistic* use of moral terms.

*Normative Argument*. No non-subjective naturalist state of affairs could ever provide reason for action.
