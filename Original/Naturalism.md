## Definitional Reductions

### Against analytic reductionism - Open Question Argument

i.e. "Bachelors are unmarried men"

- Yes! Moral-nonmoral Semantic equivalence
- Yes! Moral-nonmoral Property identity
- Yes! Moral-nonmoral Co-extension (moral supervenes on nonmoral)

### Againt synthetic reductivism - Separate Linguistic Communities

i.e. "Water is H2O", Synthetic a posteriori

- No! Moral-nonmoral Semantic equivalence
- Yes! Moral-nonmoral Property identity
- Yes! Moral-nonmoral Co-extension (moral supervenes on nonmoral)

1. People can agree on all the descriptive facts, yet disagree on the moral facts.
	- Rebuttal: But that's because they have the wrong definition of moral terms. Thus, the disagreement about moral beliefs can be explained by disagreements about definitions.
2. Definitions are purely relative. They are ascriptions of arbitrary utterances and symbols to particular concepts or objects in the world. They are appropriate only to the extent that they are supported by a particular linguistic community. Two groups can form separate linguistic communities with different definitions of moral terms, and we wouldn't say that one of the communities were incorrect. These two groups might agree on all of the descriptive beliefs and agree that neither group was linguistically incorrect, yet still disagree about moral facts. Thus, moral facts cannot be definitionally reduced to non-normative facts.

### Motivational feature of moral judgments

It seems that when one issues a moral judgment that X is good, they necessarily have a pro-attitude towards X and they would like to compel others to have a pro-attitude towards X. However, this cannot be explained under moral naturalism. On moral naturalism, if one issues a moral judgment that X is good, they are merely asserting that X has some natural property N, but mere belief that X has some natural property N cannot itself motivate any pro-attitude.

### Normative feature of moral facts

It seems that moral facts provide reasons for action for all rational agents independent of contingent desires. However, this cannot be explained under moral naturalism. On moral naturalism, a moral fact is simply a representation about the world, but no representation of reality can provide a reason for action for all rational all agents independent of contingent desires.

### Note

Non-naturalist disagree about moral-nonmoral property identity; they disagree that "X is good" is like "water is H2O"

All but the strangest non-naturalist agree about moral-nonmoral co-extension. No one denies moral supervenience,
