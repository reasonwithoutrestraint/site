## Definitional Reductions

### Open Question Argument

### Separate Linguistic Communities

1. People can agree on all the descriptive facts, yet disagree on the moral facts.
	- Rebuttal: But that's because they have the wrong definition of moral terms. Thus, the disagreement about moral beliefs can be explained by disagreements about definitions.
2. Definitions are purely relative. They are ascriptions of arbitrary utterances and symbols to particular concepts or objects in the world. They are appropriate only to the extent that they are supported by a particular linguistic community. Two groups can form separate linguistic communities with different definitions of moral terms, and we wouldn't say that one of the communities were incorrect. These two groups might agree on all of the descriptive beliefs and agree that neither group was linguistically incorrect, yet still disagree about moral facts. Thus, moral facts cannot be definitionally reduced to non-normative facts.
