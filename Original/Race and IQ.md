It is certainly possible that the Black-White IQ difference is largely genetic; there's no necessary law suggesting that that cannot be the case. But questions about IQ differences are empirical questions. Therefore, in order to test and quantify whether such genetic differences exist, we need empirical data. Adoption studies, I believe, are the most effective method to quantify just *how much* of the IQ gap is genetic versus environmental. If blacks & whites are reared in the same environment, then any arising differences are genetically caused. Inversely, if different groups of blacks are genetically similar, then any arising differences are environmentally caused. There are four major transracial adoption studies that I know of. I will consider each:

**Study 1**: Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study

This one is fairly popular, so I need not give it too much detail. Basically, the study examined the IQs of mixed children, black children, and white children who were adopted by white families. The study found higher IQ for the whites adoptees compared to the black and mixed adoptees [[1]](http://www.kjplanet.com/amp-31-10-726.pdf). If this study did indeed equalize the environments for blacks & whites, then the results would seem to indicate that the IQ gap is largely genetic. However, there are a few reasons to doubt that the study equalized the environments for blacks & whites:

(a) the children with two black parents were adopted substantially later than the other children. The average white child was adopted at about 19 months old, but the average black child was adopted at 32 months old [[2]](http://www.kjplanet.com/amp-31-10-726.pdf). The results of the study showed that children who were adopted later had much lower IQs than those who were adopted earlier. For example, black children adopted within one year of birth had IQs 7 points higher than black children adopted later [[3]](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-minnesota-transracial-adoption-study-a-follow-up-of-iq-test-performance-at-adolescence1.pdf).

(b), while the study did somewhat equalize environments *after* adoption, they failed to equalize environments *before* adoption, which can be extremely important. For example, a high blood lead level in infants can result in a noticeable reduction in IQ during adulthood [[4]](http://www.precaution.org/lib/low-level_lead_longterm_followup.19921001.pdf). Blood lead level is particularly important for the blacks in this study because, when this study was published in the 1970s, the blood lead level of black children aged 6 months-5 years was *extremely* higher than the level for white children of the same age [[5]](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad079acc.pdf). Thus, blood lead level disparities could have instigated or exaggerated IQ disparities. Blood lead level is just one example; factors such as social stimulation before adoption are also important to a child's cognitive development, but the study could not have equalized such factors. An adoption study would have looked at Blacks & Whites adopted *at birth* by similar families, but sadly no such study exists.

It should be noted that despite little-to-no IQ gains, the black and mixed race children saw considerably higher levels of academic achievement than their non-adopted racial peers. The mixed adoptees scored in the 60th, 59th, 50th, and 40th percentiles in vocabulary scores, reading scores, mathematics scores, and class rank, respectively [[6]](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-minnesota-transracial-adoption-study-a-follow-up-of-iq-test-performance-at-adolescence1.pdf). So even though the mixed race children had below-average IQ scores, they had somewhat average marks in academic achievement. For reference, the White adoptees scored in the 62th, 58th, 56th and 54th percentiles in those respective areas. 

The Black adoptees scored worse; they scored in the 54th, 48th, 36th, and 36th percentile in vocabulary scores, reading scores, mathematics scores, and class rank, respectively. Note that the 36th percentile is not *that* low (an IQ score in the 36th percentile, for example, is ~95). Further, this lower achievement could be the result of the environmental issues I presented earlier. In any case, these scores are much higher than what might be suggested by the average Black IQ of 85, which is in the 15th percentile. So while the IQs of the Black adoptees were much lower, their academic achievement was not much lower than average.

In summary, this study has a few issues. But, even ignoring the issues and assuming that it's compatible with a genetic explanation of the IQ gap, it seems compatible with an environmental explanation of the *academic achievement* gap. This is significant because, I would say, academic achievement is more important than IQ; academic achievement is desirable as a direct *end*, while IQ is an instrumental good, desirable only as a *means* to other ends like academic achievement, productivity, etc. This is the only transracial adoption study that I've found that is somewhat in favor of a mainly genetic explanation of the IQ gap (and even then, it still implies that actual achievement is environmentally caused). The next three studies seem to suggest otherwise.

**Study 2**: German IQ study by Klaus Eyferth

Psychologist Klaus Eyferth studied the IQs of white and mixed children in Germany. The mothers of the children were all white. Their fathers were either white or black members of the US occupation forces. The white children recorded an average IQ of 97.2, whereas the mixed children recorded an average of 96.5, a negligible difference [[7]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyferth_study).

There are some issues with this study, however. Firstly, the samples aren't representative of the average population, because about 30% of black applicants were rejected admission to the armed forces, while only about 3% of whites were rejected. However, despite the unrepresentative sample, if IQ were genetic, then we would still expect the white children to have much higher scores than the mixed children because:

(a) The white GIs should have had higher scores than the black GIs. Even though the admission test filtered out candidates below a certain threshold, the IQ scores for the white soldiers would *still* be distributed higher than the blacks, leading to a higher average score (imagine a Black and White IQ bell curve, with both bell curves being cut off below a certain threshold - the White IQ bell curve should yield a higher average). If the IQ gap were genetic, then we would expect this difference to be found in their children as well.

(b) [Regression to the mean](https://www.uic.edu/classes/bms/bms655/lesson11.html). Even if we ignore point (a) and assume the white and black soldiers had similar IQ scores, then, if the IQ gap were genetic, we would still expect the mixed children to have lower IQs than the white children. The reason is because the mixed children IQs would partially regress downward to the black mean, while the white children IQs would regress to the white mean. Regression to the mean is found in other genetic traits such as height, so if the IQ gap were mainly genetic, then regression to the mean should be found in this study.

The study had other issues as well. For example, about 20-25% of the Black GIs were actually French North African. Still, we should expect 75-80% of the Black GIs to have lower IQs, and, if the IQ gap were largely genetic, this difference should be found in the children. The lack of an IQ gap implies that the IQ gap is not largely genetic. Therefore, while flawed, this study is compatible with a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.

**Study 3**: British study of young children in nurseries

In this study, psychologist Barbara Tizard studied black, white, and mixed children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. The children were given psychological tests to determine their cognitive abilities. The scores were converted to give a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 10. On one test, the white children scored 102.6 and the black/mixed children scored 106.3. On another test, the white children scored 98.5 and the black/mixed children scored 98.6. On the Minnesota Nonverbal test, the white children scored 101.3 and the black/mixed children scored 107.7 [[8]](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1127540.pdf?acceptTC=true). Apparently there is a fourth test, but I didn't manage to see it in the pdf. In any case, this study is compatible with a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.

**Study 4**: IQ scores of black children raised by White families versus Black families

In this study, psychologist Elsie Moore compared IQ test scores among 23 black children adopted by middle-class white families and 23 age-matched black children adopted by middle-class black families. The black children adopted by black families scored a 104 IQ, while the black children adopted by white families scored a 117 IQ [[9]](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-24139-001). These two groups of blacks likely differed in their *environment* and not their *genes*. Therefore, the difference in the black/white family environments likely accounts for the 13 IQ point gap. Keep in mind that the black & white families were of similar socioeconomic status (middle-class). In actuality, the average black family has a much lower socioeconomic status than the average white family; therefore the difference in black/white environments would probably account for more than 13 IQ points. Clearly, this study is compatible with a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.
