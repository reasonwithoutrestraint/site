Destiny's argument

1. The only moral considerable beings are those capable of entering a social contract, i.e. capable of reciprocating social values.
2. Animals are not capable of reciprocating social values.
3. Therefore, animals are not morally considerable beings.

### Problems with (1)

1. This would justify torturing, killing, raping, etc. fetuses and children.
    - Response: No, because these beings have the *potential* to develop a capacity to reciprocate social value.
        - So the argument is this:
            1. The capacity to recriprocate social value generates moral consideration. 
            2. Children have the potential to develop this capacity.
            3. Therefore, children are morally considerable.
        - There's a hidden premise here: if X has the potential to develop capacity C, then X ought to have the same rights that are generate by having capacity C. But this premise is false. We don't think chlidren should have the right to vote, run for office, drive vehicles, consent to sex, etc. even though they have the *potential* to develop the capacities that would ordinarily generate these rights.
2. This would justify torturing, killing, raping, etc. the mentally handicapped who can nevertheless vividly experience suffering.
    - Response: Yes, in some circumstances, but we already deprive these people of rights.
        - Yes, we deprive them of *some* rights, but we certainly don't remove them from moral consideration. We don't say that we can kill, torture, rape, eat them!
    - Response: No, because we might always end up in such a circumstance, and we wouldn't want others to treat us poorly.
        - This is incompatible with your earlier response.
        - In what way can it be said that we could end up in their circumstances?
            - Response: We could end up with their exact condition.
                - This doesn't work, because there are some conditions that are impossible for us to end up in, e.g. certain genetic disorders.
            - Response: We could end up in a condition, similar to their general level of suffering, disadvantage.
                - How is this not equally true of animals?
        - If self-interest and rationality are the only concerns, this feature doesn't even matter. See next point.
3. What is the support for this other than pure intuition or emotion? It doesn't follow from pure self-interest or consistency.
    - Self-interest and consistency doesn't determine that the social contract is morally justified.
    - Self-interest and consistency determines that murder, rape, torture, etc. are not necessarily wrong. They're wrong only to the extent that you get caught. Let us imagine the *actual* cases of murder, rape, torture, etc. that have happened in the past where the person wasn't caught, e.g. police brutality where they got off free, unsolved murders, etc. We can even think of cases where ordinarily wrong things are encouraged by a society and, therefore, beneficial to perform: female genital mutilation, racist cop group, etc. These need not violate self-interest, but would they be morally wrong?     - If no, then your axiom of self-interest cannot generate nearly any moral views.
        - If yes, you are using something other than pure rationality and self-interest to generate your moral views. 
    - The entire *purpose* of morality is a tool for handling conflicting interests. 

### Problems with (2) 

1. What is meant by "reciprocate social value"? How can we know if an animal reciprocates social value?
    - It cannot be a matter of a being having in their consciousness a conception of a sort of moral law, because you said that consciousness and sentience were irrelevant considerations (But even if they are relevant considerations, this still wouldn't work because plenty of people hold this conception of the moral law, but they would quickly violate it if certain contingent circumstances were not in place). Thus, it must be reduced to a matter of the actions that the animals perform. 
    - If it means "doesn't harm others", then this doesn't work. Because animals can be trained to not harm others.
    - If it means "doesn't harm others and they wouldn't harm others even when they do so at a cost", i.e. it can't be a contingent feature of animals. This also doesn't work. Animals can be trained to not harm others even when it might be beneficial for them to do so. Furthermore, most humans would harm others if it was their only way to eat, survive, etc. If we didn't have the contingent laws, safety nets, etc. that we have today, most humans would go on harming others. But if we could prove that an individual would harm someone if it wasn't for, say, certain laws, safety nets, opportunities, medicine, etc. then it follows that we can kill and eat them?
