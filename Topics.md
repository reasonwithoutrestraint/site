## Entertainment

* Time travel: going to different universes or changing the actual universe.
* Omnipotence/afterlife: 
	1. What if there was an afterlife?
    2. In the afterlife you were omnipotent?
	3. What would you do after achieving all of your goals?
	4. Repeat life fresh?
	5. Delete memory?
* Talking to God

## Philosophical Argumentation

### Intro Philosophical

* Logical tautology/validity/satisfiability/soundness
* Linguistic: Analytic vs Synthetic
* Ontological: Necessary vs Contingent
* Epistemological: A priori vs experiential
	
### Metaphilosophical:

Questions we might ask about whether P is true:
1. What is means for P to be true
2. Why it matters whether P is true
3. What it takes for P to be true
4. Whether P really is true

Question (1) is probably the least important if we can settle 2-4.

Unnecessary Linguistic Disputes
* Meaning of moral terms
* Meaning of free will
* Meaning of knowledge
* Meaning of racism
	
### Meta-physics

- Free Will / Compatibilism / Moral responsibility
- Determinism vs Indeterminism (no difference)
- Physical/Natural/Material vs Non-physical/Supernatural/Spiritual (no difference)
- Religion
	- Unnecessary focus on names/labels, e.g. whether I'm an "atheist".
	- Arguments for/against God
		
### Meta-ethics 

(much of this can be found in my outline of my thoughts on normativity/metaethics/morality/political-philosophy)

- Reasons
- Moral Semantics: 
	- Not definitional (not analytically reductive to natural terms); People can coherently disagree after all facts are known
	- Action/attitude-guiding
		1. Those who take X to be good are tempted to prommote X (expressive)
		2. Those who take X to be good are tempted to have others promote X (prescriptive)
		3. Those who state X is good tends to tempt others to promote X (emotive)
	- More than just expressive/emotive/prescriptive
	- What we're comitted to:
		1. reasons for action/attitudes
		2. regulate ourselves
- Moral Ontology
	- Special type of reasons for action/attitudes
- is-out problem
- The central problem: 
    1. Morality/reasons internalism - moral facts denote reasons for action
    2. Reasons/motivation internalism - reason for action depends on motivational states
    3. Moral absolutism - moral reason for action is independent of our motivational states
	
### Moral Theory

- Against utilitarianism
    - Three components of utilitarianism:
        1. Measure of individual good: for utilitarianism, this is happiness
        2. Measure of collective good: maximizing total individual well-being of all agents equally.
        3. Consequentialism: the right reduces to the good in some way. 
    - Responses:
        1. How is happiness defined? (don't have huge opposition) 
            - Pleasure receptors. This is bad.
            - States of enjoyment. Better 
            - Conscious states that are preferred. Better
            - Preferences/desires. Doesn't seem like happiness
        2. What aggregation function for collective well-being?
            - Maximizing the sum of utility. Bad, because increasing people is always better. So it can be good to torture someone to increase marginal utility in X number of people, so long as X is large enough.  
            - Maximizing the average. Bad, because having children with below average utility makes the world a worse place.
            - It seems clear that world X is better than world Y, where every individual in world X has higher utility than in world Y (or they would have higher utility if placed in world Y). But if this is not true for _every_ individual, then I'm not sure.
        3. Why assume that the right reduces to the good?
            - The good is all we care about. Sure, but that says nothing about morality. Plenty of normative realms are not just matters of promoting the good (epistemology, ettiquette, etc.), so why assume that's the case for morality? E.g. epistemology is not consequentialist.
            - Metaethical: morality just is social rationality, and rationality is promoting the good. Is that what morality is?
            - Intuition: if we could prove that subjecting someone to a course of action maximized their good (even if good is defined in terms of preference satisfaction), is it right to force someone to do this for their own sake? Just because doing something promotes good doesn't mean that performing that action is good (particularly if it uses force). This scenario is possible in the following scenario: (1) person has ideal (more informed, higher order, more rational, etc.) preferences that would be satisfied by doing X, but (2) he doesn't willingly do X, and this must be because of less ideal preferences. It would be wrong to force this person to do X if (3) he also has preferences that he not be forced to do X in situations where (1) and (2) are true; but it would be okay to use force if he preferred to be forced to do X in these situations. Of course, (3) says nothing about whether performing X really is good (maybe it is, maybe it isn't); the fact is we can't use force.


#### Political philosophy

    - TBD
* Specific Issues
    - Abortion
    - Punishment
    - Consequentialism and abortion

## Empirical

### Affirmative Action: Justification and Consequences

AA does not inherently violate anyone's right. Descriptively, AA doesn't work

Normatively, several ways to justify:

- Why it's morally obligatory: 
- Why it's morally permissible: 
	- Why is discrimination normally wrong?
		- Why should racial discrimination be illegal?
		- It can't be because it's discrimination. Employers can discriminate for lots of reason.
		- It can't be because it's racist. People can be racist all the time; employers can also be racist.
		- It has nothing to do with racial discrimination per se. It has to do with the fact that there were segments of the population cut off from society. It just so happened that racial discrimination was a means to do this.
		- In a country without such problems, racial discrimination would be perfectly fine.
    - Leave it up taxpayers
	    It should be up to the people to decide. How SHOULD the people decide?:
		    1. Necessary conditions for them to value AA: It is empirically effective.
		    2. Plus, one of the following: (a) they value equal opportunity AND race differences exceed class differences, and (b) they value diversity for its own sake.

### Success/Failure of Groups
- Internal Acts vs External Acts
- Oppression
    - Useful versus non-Useful definitions 
    - How to respond under any definition
- Interracial Relations: costs and benefits
- Default of groups is degeracy; force is needed to be pulled out

### IQ & Academic Achievement

- Transracial Adoption Studies
- Meaning of heritability
- Historical IQ changes
- Present IQ differences across similar groups

### Uneeded disputes:

- Cause of racial IQ gaps
	- False dichotomy between genetics disparities and societal racism: There's a third option - internal environment. They aren't mutually exclusive - Accusations for/against racism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of the genetic differences.
	- Presumption that it influences solutions: Not necessarily. Two potential causes might require the same solution, e.g. if the cause is internal, it doesn't matter if it's culture or biology, the solution is the same. Incentivize people with good behaviors (whether due to biology or culture) to reproduce. This is lost if we ignore internal environment.
- Cause of gender differences in STEM:
	- False dichotomy between biology and sexism: there's a third option - different interests. They aren't mutually exclusive. Accusations for/against sexism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of cause of biological differences.
- Whether transgenderism is legitimate or a mental health issue: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced. Has no impact on whether such surgeries should be allowed.
- Whether preferred pronouns make sense: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced.
- There is male/white privilege (unintentional): Pointless, point directly to discrimination.
- There is white racism (intentional): Don't complain, beg for resect from oppressors. Instead, fight for rights (we already have that) and then use those rights to separate.
