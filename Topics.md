Universal argument against all arguments for God (Baysean probability)
Debunking certain arguments

-- Descriptive --

- Importance of IQ
- Environmental influences on IQ - flynn effect, gene-environment interactions cause increasing heridity with age, groups that have changed IQ)
- Race and IQ
- Race and Crime
- Group Success

More Unneeded Disputes
- Cause of racial IQ gaps
	- False dichotomy between genetics disparities and societal racism: There's a third option - internal environment. They aren't mutually exclusive - Accusations for/against racism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of the genetic differences.
	- Presumption that it influences solutions: Not necessarily. Two potential causes might require the same solution, e.g. if the cause is internal, it doesn't matter if it's culture or biology, the solution is the same. Incentivize people with good behaviors (whether due to biology or culture) to reproduce. This is lost if we ignore internal environment.
- Cause of gender differences in STEM:
	- False dichotomy between biology and sexism: there's a third option - different interests. They aren't mutually exclusive. Accusations for/against sexism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of cause of biological differences.
- Whether transgenderism is legitimate or a mental health issue: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced. Has no impact on whether such surgeries should be allowed.
- Whether preferred pronouns make sense: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced.
- There is male/white privilege (unintentional): Pointless, point directly to discrimination.
- There is white racism (intentional): Don't complain, beg for resect from oppressors. Instead, fight for rights (we already have that) and then use those rights to separate.

Miscellaneous
- Unnecessary Linguistic disputes (meaning of racism, moral terms, free will, knowledge, atheism, etc.)
- Unnecessary debates: when the truth of P is disagreed, but we agree that the truth of P reduces to S, and we agree on S
