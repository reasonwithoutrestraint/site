Religion
- No reason to believe in God, more reasonable to not believe    
- Unnecessary focus on names/labels, e.g. whether I'm an "atheist".
- Universal argument against all arguments for God (Baysean probability)

	- Fine-Tuning Argument
	- Pascal's Wager
- An argument against the Problem of Evil

Descriptive
- Race and IQ
- Group Success

More Unneeded Disputes
- Cause of racial IQ gaps
	- False dichotomy between genetics disparities and societal racism: There's a third option - internal environment. They aren't mutually exclusive - Accusations for/against racism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of the genetic differences.
	- Presumption that it influences solutions: Not necessarily. Two potential causes might require the same solution, e.g. if the cause is internal, it doesn't matter if it's culture or biology, the solution is the same. Incentivize people with good behaviors (whether due to biology or culture) to reproduce. This is lost if we ignore internal environment.
- Cause of gender differences in STEM:
	- False dichotomy between biology and sexism: there's a third option - different interests. They aren't mutually exclusive. Accusations for/against sexism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of cause of biological differences.
- Whether transgenderism is legitimate or a mental health issue: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced. Has no impact on whether such surgeries should be allowed.
- Whether preferred pronouns make sense: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced.
- There is male/white privilege (unintentional): Pointless, point directly to discrimination.
- There is white racism (intentional): Don't complain, beg for resect from oppressors. Instead, fight for rights (we already have that) and then use those rights to separate.

Miscellaneous
- Unnecessary Linguistic disputes (meaning of racism, moral terms, free will, knowledge, atheism, etc.)
- Unnecessary debates: when the truth of P is disagreed, but we agree that the truth of P reduces to S, and we agree on S

## Empirical

### Affirmative Action: Justification and Consequences

AA does not inherently violate anyone's right. Descriptively, AA doesn't work

Normatively, several ways to justify:

- Why it's morally obligatory: 
- Why it's morally permissible: 
	- Why is discrimination normally wrong?
		- Why should racial discrimination be illegal?
		- It can't be because it's discrimination. Employers can discriminate for lots of reason.
		- It can't be because it's racist. People can be racist all the time; employers can also be racist.
		- It has nothing to do with racial discrimination per se. It has to do with the fact that there were segments of the population cut off from society. It just so happened that racial discrimination was a means to do this.
		- In a country without such problems, racial discrimination would be perfectly fine.
    - Leave it up taxpayers
	    It should be up to the people to decide. How SHOULD the people decide?:
		    1. Necessary conditions for them to value AA: It is empirically effective.
		    2. Plus, one of the following: (a) they value equal opportunity AND race differences exceed class differences, and (b) they value diversity for its own sake.
