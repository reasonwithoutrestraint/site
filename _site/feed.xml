The post covered self-ownership rights, world-ownership rights, and some considerations related to the nature of those rights. In this post, I will consider the implications that I believe these ownership rights have on the permissible activities of a state. That is, I will consider the state activities that I believe are compatible with the libertarian ownership rights that I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I must note that libertarians are notorious for rejecting activities by the state that many non-libertarians might see as morally permissible or obligatory. For example, many libertarians reject forms of wealth redistribution, welfare, social safety nets, etc. because (they believe) the state violates our rights by forcing us to fund these services against our will. Some libertarians (anarchists) even claim that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; mandatory taxation is unjust. Are these conclusions correct? As a libertarian who endorses self-ownership and private property, am I committed to the rejection of the mandatory taxation by the state? If not, am I committed to the rejection of wealth redistribution, safety nets, etc. provided by the state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the formulation of libertarian ownership rights that I have previously described is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; committed to any of these conclusions. However, I do believe we should be immediately &lt;em&gt;suspicious&lt;/em&gt; of these state activities since they involve force against non-consenting persons, and force against non-consenting persons are often paradigmatic cases of rights violations. The challenge, then, is to give a &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt; for these activities by the state in a way that is compatible with the libertarian commitment to self-ownership and private property that I have formulated thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will outline and (briefly) justify a few kinds of activities that I believe the state is permitted to engage in. First, I will consider non-negotiable state activities, i.e. activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. Second, I will consider negotiable state activities, i.e. activities that the state is permitted to practice only if, and because, the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. These activities include many activities that are accepted by many non-libertarians, so one might wonder whether my formulation of libertarianism is meaningfully different from non-libertarianism. Therefore, to show that my views retain a libertarian flavor, I will conclude by listing some limitations on the state that I endorse which many non-libertarians oppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-negotiable-state-activities&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#non-negotiable-state-activities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Non-negotiable state activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I will consider &lt;em&gt;non-negotiable&lt;/em&gt; permissible forms of state activities. This includes activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common good or common will of its citizens. There are two kinds of activities that I have in mind here. The state is permitted to redistribute resources in order to guarantee (1) a certain &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resources, and (2) a certain &lt;em&gt;sufficientarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. I believe that the state is justified in imposing mandatory taxation to subsidize these activities and I believe the justification is perfectly compatible with the libertarian ownership rights that I have described before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;egalitarianism&quot;&gt;Egalitarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state is permitted to redistribute resources in order to guarantee an &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources. In a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/a-sketch-of-a-plausible-libertarianism/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I stated that everyone is entitled to the opportunity to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. On this theory, if a person controls an excessive share (i.e. more than their fair share) of natural resources, he would control resources that he does not own. Moreover, he also violates the property rights of others insofar as his excessive control actively blocks others from acquiring their fair share of natural resources. Therefore, the state is permitted to forcibly transfer resources from those with excessive resources to those who where thereby blocked from acquiring their fair share of resources. It should be clear that the state is not &lt;em&gt;initiating&lt;/em&gt; force in performing this activity. If a person controls an excess share of resources, &lt;em&gt;that person&lt;/em&gt; has initiated force on the rest of society by depriving others of resources to which they are entitled. Therefore, when the state extracts and redistributes excess resources, they are &lt;em&gt;retaliating to,&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;initiating,&lt;/em&gt; force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways this kind of taxation can be implemented. This can be implemented by directly confiscating any excessive natural resources that a person controls. However, this may not be a preferable system, even from the perspective of the worst-off members of society. Some individuals are particularly productive at generating societal value from a given amount of natural resources. So it might be in the best interest of society to allow productive individuals to control an excessive amount of natural resources but force them to &lt;em&gt;compensate&lt;/em&gt; society for their excess share. This can be done by forcibly extracting resources (natural or otherwise) from such individuals to be redistributed to other members of society. In other words, all individuals who control excess shares of natural resources must be taxed so much that their disproportionate control does not make any person economically &lt;em&gt;worse-off&lt;/em&gt; (relative to their hypothetical outcome if everyone had the opportunity to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say that resources should be “redistributed” to other members of society, one might interpret this as literally giving resources directly to their rightful owners, as in e.g., a universal basic income system. I’m not against such a system, but I must clarify that this is not the only permissible form form of redistribution, nor is it necessarily the most ideal. For example, children are also owed compensation whenever individuals appropriate more than their fair share of natural resources. However, the best method of compensation may not involve &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; transferring income to them or their parents. Rather, it may be preferable to use a portion of their compensation to subsidize other useful services such as, e.g., public education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sufficientarianism&quot;&gt;Sufficientarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/a-sketch-of-a-plausible-libertarianism/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I said that “exception rights” permit us to intrude on someone’s body or their property so long as the following conditions are met :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The intrusion imposed is of a reasonable level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The intrusion (or a similar level of intrusion) is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to bring a needy person out of peril.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The needy person is in peril through no fault of their own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The perilous circumstances are of sufficiently large gravity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe mandatory taxation by the state can be justified so long as these conditions are met. Condition 1 implies that the tax rate must be reasonably low. Condition 2 implies that the tax rate should be as low as is necessary to ensure everyone can escape peril. Condition 3 implies that taxation should be restricted to alleviating burdens for those who are not responsible for their circumstances. Finally, condition 4 implies that the taxation should be restricted to alleviating burdens of sufficiently large gravity. Keep in mind that these conditions are required only for justifications of state activity based on “exception rights.” I go into more detail on this particular justification of state activity in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/justifying-the-state-on-libertarian-grounds/&quot;&gt;separate post&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the state is permitted to ensure the minimum interference necessary (so long as the intrusion is minor) to ensure that everyone has a reasonable opportunity to escape peril of sufficiently large gravity. This is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; circumstance where the state is permitted to &lt;em&gt;initiate&lt;/em&gt; interference against a person’s body or property (hence why they are called “exception rights”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of perils are of “sufficiently large gravity”? At a minimum, this includes being unable to defend one’s rights, e.g. the rights associated with self-ownership, the rights associated with property ownership, and the right to the opportunity to acquire a fair share of natural resources. Therefore, at a minimum, I believe the state is permitted to impose mandatory taxation to protect everyone’s rights. In order to protect these rights, the state may impose mandatory taxation to fund the activities of what Nozick calls the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night-watchman_state&quot;&gt;minimal state&lt;/a&gt;”, i.e. the police, the courts, and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it may be reasonable to assume that “sufficiently large gravity” also includes lacking the reasonable opportunity to &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; one’s rights. To have a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; opportunity to &lt;em&gt;exercise&lt;/em&gt; one’s rights, it is not sufficient that one is &lt;em&gt;protected&lt;/em&gt; from rights violations by others. It is also necessary that one have the &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; to take exercise those rights. Therefore, the state &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be permitted to subsidize access to goods/services (e.g. education, food, certain forms of health care, etc.) that are necessary to develop this capacity for people who would otherwise lack the reasonable opportunity to acquire those goods/services for themselves. Whether the state is permitted to subsidize these activities will require further argument and deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;negotiable-state-activities&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#negotiable-state-activities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Negotiable state activities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I will consider &lt;em&gt;negotiable&lt;/em&gt; permissible forms of state activities. This includes activities that the state is permitted to practice only if, and because, they serve the common good or common will of its citizens. There are two kinds of activities that I have in mind here: (1) state enforcement of the rules regarding common property, and (2) the regulation of negative externalities, including what I call &lt;em&gt;opportunity-constraining incentives&lt;/em&gt;. I believe that the state is justified in imposing mandatory taxation to subsidize these activities and I believe that the justification is perfectly compatible with the libertarian formulation that I have given thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-property&quot;&gt;Common property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first negotiable form of permissible state activity concerns common property. Recall that common property refers to resources where multiple people have the right to use the resource in specified ways. Let’s limit the discussion here to &lt;em&gt;collective&lt;/em&gt; property (i.e. only a particular group of individuals are permitted to use the resource) because that is easier to reason about. If a certain resource is collectively owned by a group of people, then there must be rules on how the resource may be used. The &lt;em&gt;owners&lt;/em&gt; of the resource should obviously be the ones who determine the content of the rules. Therefore, anyone who uses the property without respecting these rules would violate the rights of the property owners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the state is permitted to enforce property rights, the state is also permitted to enforce the rules decided by the owners regarding the use of the property. This includes excluding non-members from using the property and ensuring that members who use the property obey the rules decided by the group. I called this a &lt;em&gt;negotiable&lt;/em&gt; state activity because the state is only permitted to enforce rules which are decided by a certain group of people (namely, the owners of the collective property). For example, if a pond is collectively owned by a group of people in an area, then the state may enforce the rules that the owners decide regarding the use of the pond (such as e.g. rules to limit overcrowding or pollution).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;negative-externalities&quot;&gt;Negative externalities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second negotiable form of permissible state activity concerns negative externalities. Many libertarians agree that we are justified in interfering with economic transactions that impose negative externalities on others (e.g. left-libertarian &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/VALLAT&quot;&gt;Peter Vallentyne (2007)&lt;/a&gt; argues that the state may legitimately overcome market failures in general). For example, many endorse regulating factories to limit their production of pollution. I agree with these regulations because I believe that pollution constitutes a serious negative externality which interferes with the bodies and property of other persons. However, I deviate from many libertarians in that I support vastly more extensive regulations since I believe the set of negative externalities that constitute interference encompasses far more than what most libertarians would consider. Specifically, I believe the state is permitted to penalize economic transactions that produce &lt;em&gt;opportunity-constraining incentives&lt;/em&gt; (this is my personal terminology). Opportunity-constraining incentives occur when the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a free market, fully informed and fully rational individuals are incentivized to participate in economic transactions of type X.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These incentives lead to widespread participation in economic transactions of type X, which in turn leads to the absence of certain opportunities (call these opportunities of type Y).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The individuals affected by these incentives, if fully informed and fully rational, would prefer to live in (a) a society with opportunities of type Y over (b) a society in which people can participate in economic transactions of type X without government penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these situations arise, the state is permitted to penalize such transactions to prevent the opportunity-constraining incentives. A more concrete example may be useful. Imagine a free market where no companies provided benefits such as time-off, safety regulations, work breaks, etc. to their employees. Some companies attempt to provide such benefits to employees, but this lowers their productivity. As a result, consumers are incentivized to support companies without these benefits (e.g. because such companies are able to sell goods at lower prices due to their superior productivity). This leads to companies without benefits being the only successful and reliable businesses, which means that companies without benefits are the only reliable opportunities for employment available. The result is that workers, for the most part, lack benefits such as time-off, safety regulations, etc. In actuality, consumers (if fully informed and fully rational) would &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to live in a society in which companies &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; provide benefits to employees despite the overall decrease in economic productivity. In this situation, I believe the state is permitted to penalize companies that employ workers without providing essential benefits to them. The reason is that such transactions produce opportunity-constraining incentives because the 3 conditions from above are met: (1) in a free market, fully informed and fully rational consumers are incentivized to support companies that do not provide benefits to workers, (2) these incentives lead to the absence of employment opportunities providing worker benefits, and (3) the individuals affected by these incentives, if fully informed and fully rational, would prefer to live in (a) a society with employment opportunities providing worker benefits over (b) a more productive society in which companies can, without government penalty, employ workers without providing benefits to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In situations like this, the state may prevent opportunity-constraining incentives by either (a) outright banning the economic transactions that produce such incentives (e.g. forcing corporations to provide benefits to employees), or (b) taxing economic transactions that produce these incentives (e.g. taxing corporations that do not provide benefits to employees) so that such transactions are no more economically productive than alternatives. What justifies this kind of state interference? One might say that it improves societal well-being but I don’t believe considerations about well-being are sufficient to permit the initiation of interference. A true defense of this intervention is beyond the scope of this post, but I can give a rough sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that this kind of state interference is permitted because it is not an &lt;em&gt;initiation of&lt;/em&gt; interference. Economic transactions that produce opportunity-constraining incentives constitute &lt;em&gt;initiations&lt;/em&gt; of interference. Why? Because harmful &lt;em&gt;incentives&lt;/em&gt; can interfere with someone’s life just as much as a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt; can. Consider what makes a threat to violence an unjust interference in someone’s life. The problem with a &lt;em&gt;threat&lt;/em&gt; to violence is not that it directly &lt;em&gt;commits&lt;/em&gt; violence on a person. The problem with a threat to violence is, if it is a legitimate threat, that it unjustifiably modifies the &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;options&lt;/em&gt; available to a person. If I threaten to kill Adam if he doesn’t punch Bob, then, if the threat is legitimate, Adam no longer has the &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; option to refuse to punch Bob, which means I have interfered with both Adam and Bob, and I have violated both of their rights. Likewise, incentives can also unjustifiably modify the rational options available to a person. For example, if I incentivize a group of people to steal your property (e.g. by offering them a reward), then I have interfered with your right to property by unjustifiably modifying the rational options of that group of people. So creating threats and creating incentives can be wrong for very similar reasons, i.e. they unjustifiably modify the rational options available to persons. In fact, threats can be considered a special &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of incentive (specifically &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; incentives). With that being said, I consider the participation in economic transactions that produce opportunity-constraining incentives as unjustifiable modifications on the rational options available to a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; of people. Specifically, these incentives make it irrational for the group to support transactions that are necessary to produce certain important opportunities (e.g. in the example from above, they make it irrational to support companies that provide benefits to workers). Thus, the state is justified in penalizing transactions that produce these incentives; the state would be &lt;em&gt;retaliating to&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to &lt;em&gt;initiating&lt;/em&gt;, interference. Much more obviously needs to be said but this, I believe, is a sufficient rough sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation of opportunity-constraining incentives can justify imposing penalties that many &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/#PolCom&quot;&gt;communitarians&lt;/a&gt; endorse. For example, this kind of reasoning can perhaps justify “imposing restrictions on large-scale discount outlets such as Wal-Mart that threaten to displace small, fragmented, and diverse family and locally owned stores” or “implementing laws regulating plant closures so as to protect local communities from the effects of rapid capital mobility and sudden industrial change.” I do not have a strong opinion on the degree to which the state is permitted to impose these kinds of penalties. It will be interesting to investigate this in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this subsection, I stated that whether the state is permitted to engage in &lt;em&gt;negotiable&lt;/em&gt; activities depends on the common will (or common interest) of its citizens. I have not specified the &lt;em&gt;procedure&lt;/em&gt; that ought to be used to determine the common will (or common interest) of the citizens. That is because the procedure does not inherently matter. We ought to use whatever procedure best &lt;em&gt;approximates&lt;/em&gt; the common will/interest of the citizens in the actual world, whether that is a democracy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan&quot;&gt;epistocracy&lt;/a&gt;, monarchy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy&quot;&gt;noocracy&lt;/a&gt;, etc. My post here is completely agnostic with respect to which procedure best approximates the common will/interest of the citizens. That’s a &lt;em&gt;descriptive&lt;/em&gt; question, not a &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; question. However, answering this descriptive question will obviously have normative implications on which state activities are permissible. For example, if democracies are the best procedure to approximate the common will/interest of the citizens, then the state would have a non-negotiable duty to provide the institutions necessary to properly facilitate democratic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;differences-with-non-libertarians&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#differences-with-other-theories&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Differences with non-libertarians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have endorsed here many permissible state activities that many non-libertarians agree with. For example, I claimed that the state is permitted to guarantee a certain &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources and a certain &lt;em&gt;sufficientarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. I also claimed that the state is permitted to intervene in the market to prevent certain negative incentives produced by a free market. So it might seem that my views are not meaningfully different from the views of other non-libertarians or the views of other non-libertarian theories (such as e.g. Rawlsianism, egalitarianism, welfarism, etc.). Therefore, to show that my views retain a deeply libertarian flavor, I will conclude by listing some limitations on the state that I endorse which many non-libertarians oppose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strong-moral-presumption-against-the-initiation-of-interference&quot;&gt;The strong moral presumption against the initiation of interference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many non-academic libertarians who believe a person or the state should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; initiate interference against another person’s body or property, I believe that there are cases where a person or the state &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be permitted to initiate interference (because I think rights are defeasible, for reasons I gave in a previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/a-sketch-of-a-plausible-libertarianism/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). However, I do hold that there is a &lt;em&gt;strong&lt;/em&gt; moral &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; against the state initiating interference against a person’s body or property. My current position is that the state may initiate interference &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; under very specific circumstances that I outlined earlier (see the “sufficientarian” section from above). Outside of this exception, the state should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;initiate&lt;/em&gt; interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how this departs from non-libertarians, consider freedom of association. I believe that private businesses should be allowed to discriminate customers and employees based on any characteristic, including characteristics that constitute &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.subscriptlaw.com/blog/protected-classes&quot;&gt;protected classes&lt;/a&gt;, e.g. race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. The one exception to this general rule is if rampant discrimination against a particular group deprived them of the opportunity to acquire certain essential goods such as housing, education, medical care, occupation, etc. (as this would violate the “sufficientarian” condition described above). However, even with this exception, my view is still &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; from the typical view because I don’t believe this exception applies to any groups in the U.S. today (aside from, perhaps, the disabled), which means I don’t think anti-discrimination laws in the U.S. today are just. More importantly, even if this exception applied to certain groups in the U.S. today, the proper solution need not be to force private businesses to associate with these groups. A better solution would be to redistribute resources to members of the disadvantaged group and/or tax businesses that discriminate against such individuals. My position on freedom of association also applies to other freedoms, such as e.g. freedom of speech and freedom to engage in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimless_crime&quot;&gt;victimless crimes&lt;/a&gt;” (e.g. recreational drug use, prostitution, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-insignificance-of-well-being-and-suffering&quot;&gt;The insignificance of well-being and suffering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many non-libertarians, I do not believe that the promotion of well-being or alleviation of suffering is, by itself, sufficient to justify the initiation of interference. The state may &lt;em&gt;initiate&lt;/em&gt; interference only to guarantee that everyone has the opportunity to acquire certain essential goods (recall that “sufficientarian” condition described earlier). Note that this initiation of intrusion is not justified because of well-being or suffering. Rather, the intrusion is justified when such intrusion is &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; and is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to help &lt;em&gt;faultless&lt;/em&gt; individuals escape &lt;em&gt;perilous&lt;/em&gt; circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that a person’s circumstance is “perilous” if and only if they have sufficiently low (high) levels of well-being (suffering), therefore (according to my “sufficientarian” condition) the promotion (alleviation) of well-being (suffering) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sufficient to justify the initiation of interference. I have three responses to such an argument: (1) “peril” can be defined without appealing to well-being or suffering (e.g. many &lt;a href=&quot;https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1382&quot;&gt;sufficientarian&lt;/a&gt; theories define their threshold in terms of resources, capabilities, or autonomy, as opposed to welfare), (2) even if perilous circumstances are determined by well-being/suffering, this would still only permit initiating interference to bring individuals up to a certain &lt;em&gt;threshold&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to permitting any interference that improved well-being or alleviated suffering, and (3) there are 3 other necessary conditions to justify initiating the interference (the interference must be of a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; cost, it must be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt;, and the beneficiary must be &lt;em&gt;faultless&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-insignificance-of-inequality&quot;&gt;The insignificance of inequality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many non-libertarians, I believe that the state is prohibited from redistributing resources solely for the sake of reducing inequality. I only have two requirements concerning the distribution of economic resources. I require that (1) that everyone has a certain &lt;em&gt;sufficientarian&lt;/em&gt; opportunity to acquire certain essential goods, and (2) that everyone has the &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt; to acquire equally valuable &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resources. Note how this second principle, while &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; in spirit, permits rampant inequalities in economic resources. This is because (a) the principle is concerned with &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resources specifically, as opposed to economic resources in general, and (b) the principle is concerned with equality of &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;acquire&lt;/em&gt; resources, as opposed to equality of outcome (see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_of_outcome#Comparing_equalities:_outcome_vs._opportunity&quot;&gt;equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome&lt;/a&gt;). The rampant inequality permitted here is incompatible with, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#TwoPriJusFai&quot;&gt;Rawlsianism&lt;/a&gt; which permits economic inequalities only if they are “to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society”. My theory permits rampant inequalities even if they do not benefit the least-advantaged members of society, so long as these inequalities are not the result of unfair opportunity to acquire natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strong-presumption-of-decentralization&quot;&gt;The strong presumption of decentralization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State activities, both negotiable and non-negotiable, should be as decentralized as is reasonably possible (in accordance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity&quot;&gt;subsidiarity principle&lt;/a&gt;). In other words, when determining the scope (e.g. city, state, or federal) over which a particular government policy applies, there should be a strong &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; towards applying the policy over more local levels. State activities should extend over broader levels of government &lt;em&gt;only if&lt;/em&gt; the activity cannot be applied over more local levels (e.g. national defense). This differs from the political views of many other individuals who seem to want their preferred policies to extend over the broadest scope possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why I favor the localization of government power. Some of these reasons do not depend on my formulation of libertarian ownership rights. For example, decentralizing state power can be a useful remedy against &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority#Federated_centralization_excess&quot;&gt;tyranny of the majority&lt;/a&gt;. Other reasons do appeal to my formulation of libertarian ownership rights. For example, here are a few such reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State activities that enforce collective property rights should apply at local levels because different collectively owned resources are often owned by groups in different geographic regions, and the rules regarding the use of any collective property ought to be determined by the group owning the property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State activities that prohibit negative externalities should apply at local levels possible because the effects of the negative externalities are often (but not always) limited to the specific regions within which the transactions take place.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the state forces individuals to compensate others for their excess share of resources, this should typically be done at local levels because when one party is wronged because another party has control over an excess share of natural resources, this typically happens because the two parties are within a similar proximity. For example, if person B controlled slightly more than their fair share of land, then person A cannot claim that this interfered with her access to a fair share of land if A lives on the other side of the planet. Because parties can typically only wrong each other in this way when they are within a similar region, the adjudication and compensation for these wrongs should be handled by institutions &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that specific region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the state, I believe there are some activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. This includes state activities to guarantee a certain &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources and state activities to guarantee a certain &lt;em&gt;sufficientarian&lt;/em&gt; opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. Possibly, the state may also have a non-negotiable permission/obligation to provide and protect the institutions necessary to properly facilitate democratic decision making (if democracies are the best systems for determining the common interest/will of its citizens). There are also activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice only if, and because, the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. This includes enforcing the rules of collective property and regulating economic transactions that have sufficiently damaging negative externalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">In a previous post, I stated that people have a variety of libertarian ownership rights. The post covered self-ownership rights, world-ownership rights, and some considerations related to the nature of those rights. In this post, I will consider the implications that I believe these ownership rights have on the permissible activities of a state. That is, I will consider the state activities that I believe are compatible with the libertarian ownership rights that I described earlier. To start, I must note that libertarians are notorious for rejecting activities by the state that many non-libertarians might see as morally permissible or obligatory. For example, many libertarians reject forms of wealth redistribution, welfare, social safety nets, etc. because (they believe) the state violates our rights by forcing us to fund these services against our will. Some libertarians (anarchists) even claim that all mandatory taxation is unjust. Are these conclusions correct? As a libertarian who endorses self-ownership and private property, am I committed to the rejection of the mandatory taxation by the state? If not, am I committed to the rejection of wealth redistribution, safety nets, etc. provided by the state? I believe that the formulation of libertarian ownership rights that I have previously described is not committed to any of these conclusions. However, I do believe we should be immediately suspicious of these state activities since they involve force against non-consenting persons, and force against non-consenting persons are often paradigmatic cases of rights violations. The challenge, then, is to give a justification for these activities by the state in a way that is compatible with the libertarian commitment to self-ownership and private property that I have formulated thus far. In this post, I will outline and (briefly) justify a few kinds of activities that I believe the state is permitted to engage in. First, I will consider non-negotiable state activities, i.e. activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. Second, I will consider negotiable state activities, i.e. activities that the state is permitted to practice only if, and because, the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. These activities include many activities that are accepted by many non-libertarians, so one might wonder whether my formulation of libertarianism is meaningfully different from non-libertarianism. Therefore, to show that my views retain a libertarian flavor, I will conclude by listing some limitations on the state that I endorse which many non-libertarians oppose. Non-negotiable state activities Here, I will consider non-negotiable permissible forms of state activities. This includes activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common good or common will of its citizens. There are two kinds of activities that I have in mind here. The state is permitted to redistribute resources in order to guarantee (1) a certain egalitarian distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources, and (2) a certain sufficientarian distribution of opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. I believe that the state is justified in imposing mandatory taxation to subsidize these activities and I believe the justification is perfectly compatible with the libertarian ownership rights that I have described before. Egalitarianism The state is permitted to redistribute resources in order to guarantee an egalitarian distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources. In a previous post, I stated that everyone is entitled to the opportunity to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. On this theory, if a person controls an excessive share (i.e. more than their fair share) of natural resources, he would control resources that he does not own. Moreover, he also violates the property rights of others insofar as his excessive control actively blocks others from acquiring their fair share of natural resources. Therefore, the state is permitted to forcibly transfer resources from those with excessive resources to those who where thereby blocked from acquiring their fair share of resources. It should be clear that the state is not initiating force in performing this activity. If a person controls an excess share of resources, that person has initiated force on the rest of society by depriving others of resources to which they are entitled. Therefore, when the state extracts and redistributes excess resources, they are retaliating to, rather than initiating, force. There are a few ways this kind of taxation can be implemented. This can be implemented by directly confiscating any excessive natural resources that a person controls. However, this may not be a preferable system, even from the perspective of the worst-off members of society. Some individuals are particularly productive at generating societal value from a given amount of natural resources. So it might be in the best interest of society to allow productive individuals to control an excessive amount of natural resources but force them to compensate society for their excess share. This can be done by forcibly extracting resources (natural or otherwise) from such individuals to be redistributed to other members of society. In other words, all individuals who control excess shares of natural resources must be taxed so much that their disproportionate control does not make any person economically worse-off (relative to their hypothetical outcome if everyone had the opportunity to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources). When I say that resources should be “redistributed” to other members of society, one might interpret this as literally giving resources directly to their rightful owners, as in e.g., a universal basic income system. I’m not against such a system, but I must clarify that this is not the only permissible form form of redistribution, nor is it necessarily the most ideal. For example, children are also owed compensation whenever individuals appropriate more than their fair share of natural resources. However, the best method of compensation may not involve merely transferring income to them or their parents. Rather, it may be preferable to use a portion of their compensation to subsidize other useful services such as, e.g., public education. Sufficientarianism In a previous post, I said that “exception rights” permit us to intrude on someone’s body or their property so long as the following conditions are met : The intrusion imposed is of a reasonable level. The intrusion (or a similar level of intrusion) is necessary to bring a needy person out of peril. The needy person is in peril through no fault of their own. The perilous circumstances are of sufficiently large gravity. I believe mandatory taxation by the state can be justified so long as these conditions are met. Condition 1 implies that the tax rate must be reasonably low. Condition 2 implies that the tax rate should be as low as is necessary to ensure everyone can escape peril. Condition 3 implies that taxation should be restricted to alleviating burdens for those who are not responsible for their circumstances. Finally, condition 4 implies that the taxation should be restricted to alleviating burdens of sufficiently large gravity. Keep in mind that these conditions are required only for justifications of state activity based on “exception rights.” I go into more detail on this particular justification of state activity in a separate post. In other words, the state is permitted to ensure the minimum interference necessary (so long as the intrusion is minor) to ensure that everyone has a reasonable opportunity to escape peril of sufficiently large gravity. This is the only circumstance where the state is permitted to initiate interference against a person’s body or property (hence why they are called “exception rights”). What kinds of perils are of “sufficiently large gravity”? At a minimum, this includes being unable to defend one’s rights, e.g. the rights associated with self-ownership, the rights associated with property ownership, and the right to the opportunity to acquire a fair share of natural resources. Therefore, at a minimum, I believe the state is permitted to impose mandatory taxation to protect everyone’s rights. In order to protect these rights, the state may impose mandatory taxation to fund the activities of what Nozick calls the “minimal state”, i.e. the police, the courts, and the military. Additionally, it may be reasonable to assume that “sufficiently large gravity” also includes lacking the reasonable opportunity to exercise one’s rights. To have a reasonable opportunity to exercise one’s rights, it is not sufficient that one is protected from rights violations by others. It is also necessary that one have the capacity to take exercise those rights. Therefore, the state may be permitted to subsidize access to goods/services (e.g. education, food, certain forms of health care, etc.) that are necessary to develop this capacity for people who would otherwise lack the reasonable opportunity to acquire those goods/services for themselves. Whether the state is permitted to subsidize these activities will require further argument and deliberation. Negotiable state activities Here, I will consider negotiable permissible forms of state activities. This includes activities that the state is permitted to practice only if, and because, they serve the common good or common will of its citizens. There are two kinds of activities that I have in mind here: (1) state enforcement of the rules regarding common property, and (2) the regulation of negative externalities, including what I call opportunity-constraining incentives. I believe that the state is justified in imposing mandatory taxation to subsidize these activities and I believe that the justification is perfectly compatible with the libertarian formulation that I have given thus far. Common property The first negotiable form of permissible state activity concerns common property. Recall that common property refers to resources where multiple people have the right to use the resource in specified ways. Let’s limit the discussion here to collective property (i.e. only a particular group of individuals are permitted to use the resource) because that is easier to reason about. If a certain resource is collectively owned by a group of people, then there must be rules on how the resource may be used. The owners of the resource should obviously be the ones who determine the content of the rules. Therefore, anyone who uses the property without respecting these rules would violate the rights of the property owners. Because the state is permitted to enforce property rights, the state is also permitted to enforce the rules decided by the owners regarding the use of the property. This includes excluding non-members from using the property and ensuring that members who use the property obey the rules decided by the group. I called this a negotiable state activity because the state is only permitted to enforce rules which are decided by a certain group of people (namely, the owners of the collective property). For example, if a pond is collectively owned by a group of people in an area, then the state may enforce the rules that the owners decide regarding the use of the pond (such as e.g. rules to limit overcrowding or pollution). Negative externalities The second negotiable form of permissible state activity concerns negative externalities. Many libertarians agree that we are justified in interfering with economic transactions that impose negative externalities on others (e.g. left-libertarian Peter Vallentyne (2007) argues that the state may legitimately overcome market failures in general). For example, many endorse regulating factories to limit their production of pollution. I agree with these regulations because I believe that pollution constitutes a serious negative externality which interferes with the bodies and property of other persons. However, I deviate from many libertarians in that I support vastly more extensive regulations since I believe the set of negative externalities that constitute interference encompasses far more than what most libertarians would consider. Specifically, I believe the state is permitted to penalize economic transactions that produce opportunity-constraining incentives (this is my personal terminology). Opportunity-constraining incentives occur when the following conditions are met: In a free market, fully informed and fully rational individuals are incentivized to participate in economic transactions of type X. These incentives lead to widespread participation in economic transactions of type X, which in turn leads to the absence of certain opportunities (call these opportunities of type Y). The individuals affected by these incentives, if fully informed and fully rational, would prefer to live in (a) a society with opportunities of type Y over (b) a society in which people can participate in economic transactions of type X without government penalty. When these situations arise, the state is permitted to penalize such transactions to prevent the opportunity-constraining incentives. A more concrete example may be useful. Imagine a free market where no companies provided benefits such as time-off, safety regulations, work breaks, etc. to their employees. Some companies attempt to provide such benefits to employees, but this lowers their productivity. As a result, consumers are incentivized to support companies without these benefits (e.g. because such companies are able to sell goods at lower prices due to their superior productivity). This leads to companies without benefits being the only successful and reliable businesses, which means that companies without benefits are the only reliable opportunities for employment available. The result is that workers, for the most part, lack benefits such as time-off, safety regulations, etc. In actuality, consumers (if fully informed and fully rational) would prefer to live in a society in which companies did provide benefits to employees despite the overall decrease in economic productivity. In this situation, I believe the state is permitted to penalize companies that employ workers without providing essential benefits to them. The reason is that such transactions produce opportunity-constraining incentives because the 3 conditions from above are met: (1) in a free market, fully informed and fully rational consumers are incentivized to support companies that do not provide benefits to workers, (2) these incentives lead to the absence of employment opportunities providing worker benefits, and (3) the individuals affected by these incentives, if fully informed and fully rational, would prefer to live in (a) a society with employment opportunities providing worker benefits over (b) a more productive society in which companies can, without government penalty, employ workers without providing benefits to them. In situations like this, the state may prevent opportunity-constraining incentives by either (a) outright banning the economic transactions that produce such incentives (e.g. forcing corporations to provide benefits to employees), or (b) taxing economic transactions that produce these incentives (e.g. taxing corporations that do not provide benefits to employees) so that such transactions are no more economically productive than alternatives. What justifies this kind of state interference? One might say that it improves societal well-being but I don’t believe considerations about well-being are sufficient to permit the initiation of interference. A true defense of this intervention is beyond the scope of this post, but I can give a rough sketch. The basic idea is that this kind of state interference is permitted because it is not an initiation of interference. Economic transactions that produce opportunity-constraining incentives constitute initiations of interference. Why? Because harmful incentives can interfere with someone’s life just as much as a threat can. Consider what makes a threat to violence an unjust interference in someone’s life. The problem with a threat to violence is not that it directly commits violence on a person. The problem with a threat to violence is, if it is a legitimate threat, that it unjustifiably modifies the rational options available to a person. If I threaten to kill Adam if he doesn’t punch Bob, then, if the threat is legitimate, Adam no longer has the rational option to refuse to punch Bob, which means I have interfered with both Adam and Bob, and I have violated both of their rights. Likewise, incentives can also unjustifiably modify the rational options available to a person. For example, if I incentivize a group of people to steal your property (e.g. by offering them a reward), then I have interfered with your right to property by unjustifiably modifying the rational options of that group of people. So creating threats and creating incentives can be wrong for very similar reasons, i.e. they unjustifiably modify the rational options available to persons. In fact, threats can be considered a special type of incentive (specifically negative incentives). With that being said, I consider the participation in economic transactions that produce opportunity-constraining incentives as unjustifiable modifications on the rational options available to a group of people. Specifically, these incentives make it irrational for the group to support transactions that are necessary to produce certain important opportunities (e.g. in the example from above, they make it irrational to support companies that provide benefits to workers). Thus, the state is justified in penalizing transactions that produce these incentives; the state would be retaliating to, as opposed to initiating, interference. Much more obviously needs to be said but this, I believe, is a sufficient rough sketch. The regulation of opportunity-constraining incentives can justify imposing penalties that many communitarians endorse. For example, this kind of reasoning can perhaps justify “imposing restrictions on large-scale discount outlets such as Wal-Mart that threaten to displace small, fragmented, and diverse family and locally owned stores” or “implementing laws regulating plant closures so as to protect local communities from the effects of rapid capital mobility and sudden industrial change.” I do not have a strong opinion on the degree to which the state is permitted to impose these kinds of penalties. It will be interesting to investigate this in a separate post. In this subsection, I stated that whether the state is permitted to engage in negotiable activities depends on the common will (or common interest) of its citizens. I have not specified the procedure that ought to be used to determine the common will (or common interest) of the citizens. That is because the procedure does not inherently matter. We ought to use whatever procedure best approximates the common will/interest of the citizens in the actual world, whether that is a democracy, epistocracy, monarchy, noocracy, etc. My post here is completely agnostic with respect to which procedure best approximates the common will/interest of the citizens. That’s a descriptive question, not a normative question. However, answering this descriptive question will obviously have normative implications on which state activities are permissible. For example, if democracies are the best procedure to approximate the common will/interest of the citizens, then the state would have a non-negotiable duty to provide the institutions necessary to properly facilitate democratic decision making. Differences with non-libertarians I have endorsed here many permissible state activities that many non-libertarians agree with. For example, I claimed that the state is permitted to guarantee a certain egalitarian distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources and a certain sufficientarian distribution of opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. I also claimed that the state is permitted to intervene in the market to prevent certain negative incentives produced by a free market. So it might seem that my views are not meaningfully different from the views of other non-libertarians or the views of other non-libertarian theories (such as e.g. Rawlsianism, egalitarianism, welfarism, etc.). Therefore, to show that my views retain a deeply libertarian flavor, I will conclude by listing some limitations on the state that I endorse which many non-libertarians oppose: The strong moral presumption against the initiation of interference Unlike many non-academic libertarians who believe a person or the state should never initiate interference against another person’s body or property, I believe that there are cases where a person or the state may be permitted to initiate interference (because I think rights are defeasible, for reasons I gave in a previous post). However, I do hold that there is a strong moral presumption against the state initiating interference against a person’s body or property. My current position is that the state may initiate interference only under very specific circumstances that I outlined earlier (see the “sufficientarian” section from above). Outside of this exception, the state should not initiate interference. To see how this departs from non-libertarians, consider freedom of association. I believe that private businesses should be allowed to discriminate customers and employees based on any characteristic, including characteristics that constitute protected classes, e.g. race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. The one exception to this general rule is if rampant discrimination against a particular group deprived them of the opportunity to acquire certain essential goods such as housing, education, medical care, occupation, etc. (as this would violate the “sufficientarian” condition described above). However, even with this exception, my view is still far from the typical view because I don’t believe this exception applies to any groups in the U.S. today (aside from, perhaps, the disabled), which means I don’t think anti-discrimination laws in the U.S. today are just. More importantly, even if this exception applied to certain groups in the U.S. today, the proper solution need not be to force private businesses to associate with these groups. A better solution would be to redistribute resources to members of the disadvantaged group and/or tax businesses that discriminate against such individuals. My position on freedom of association also applies to other freedoms, such as e.g. freedom of speech and freedom to engage in “victimless crimes” (e.g. recreational drug use, prostitution, etc.). The insignificance of well-being and suffering Unlike many non-libertarians, I do not believe that the promotion of well-being or alleviation of suffering is, by itself, sufficient to justify the initiation of interference. The state may initiate interference only to guarantee that everyone has the opportunity to acquire certain essential goods (recall that “sufficientarian” condition described earlier). Note that this initiation of intrusion is not justified because of well-being or suffering. Rather, the intrusion is justified when such intrusion is reasonable and is necessary to help faultless individuals escape perilous circumstances. One might argue that a person’s circumstance is “perilous” if and only if they have sufficiently low (high) levels of well-being (suffering), therefore (according to my “sufficientarian” condition) the promotion (alleviation) of well-being (suffering) is sufficient to justify the initiation of interference. I have three responses to such an argument: (1) “peril” can be defined without appealing to well-being or suffering (e.g. many sufficientarian theories define their threshold in terms of resources, capabilities, or autonomy, as opposed to welfare), (2) even if perilous circumstances are determined by well-being/suffering, this would still only permit initiating interference to bring individuals up to a certain threshold, as opposed to permitting any interference that improved well-being or alleviated suffering, and (3) there are 3 other necessary conditions to justify initiating the interference (the interference must be of a reasonable cost, it must be necessary, and the beneficiary must be faultless). The insignificance of inequality Unlike many non-libertarians, I believe that the state is prohibited from redistributing resources solely for the sake of reducing inequality. I only have two requirements concerning the distribution of economic resources. I require that (1) that everyone has a certain sufficientarian opportunity to acquire certain essential goods, and (2) that everyone has the opportunity to acquire equally valuable natural resources. Note how this second principle, while egalitarian in spirit, permits rampant inequalities in economic resources. This is because (a) the principle is concerned with natural resources specifically, as opposed to economic resources in general, and (b) the principle is concerned with equality of opportunity to acquire resources, as opposed to equality of outcome (see: equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome). The rampant inequality permitted here is incompatible with, say, Rawlsianism which permits economic inequalities only if they are “to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society”. My theory permits rampant inequalities even if they do not benefit the least-advantaged members of society, so long as these inequalities are not the result of unfair opportunity to acquire natural resources. The strong presumption of decentralization State activities, both negotiable and non-negotiable, should be as decentralized as is reasonably possible (in accordance with the subsidiarity principle). In other words, when determining the scope (e.g. city, state, or federal) over which a particular government policy applies, there should be a strong presumption towards applying the policy over more local levels. State activities should extend over broader levels of government only if the activity cannot be applied over more local levels (e.g. national defense). This differs from the political views of many other individuals who seem to want their preferred policies to extend over the broadest scope possible. There are a few reasons why I favor the localization of government power. Some of these reasons do not depend on my formulation of libertarian ownership rights. For example, decentralizing state power can be a useful remedy against tyranny of the majority. Other reasons do appeal to my formulation of libertarian ownership rights. For example, here are a few such reasons: State activities that enforce collective property rights should apply at local levels because different collectively owned resources are often owned by groups in different geographic regions, and the rules regarding the use of any collective property ought to be determined by the group owning the property. State activities that prohibit negative externalities should apply at local levels possible because the effects of the negative externalities are often (but not always) limited to the specific regions within which the transactions take place. When the state forces individuals to compensate others for their excess share of resources, this should typically be done at local levels because when one party is wronged because another party has control over an excess share of natural resources, this typically happens because the two parties are within a similar proximity. For example, if person B controlled slightly more than their fair share of land, then person A cannot claim that this interfered with her access to a fair share of land if A lives on the other side of the planet. Because parties can typically only wrong each other in this way when they are within a similar region, the adjudication and compensation for these wrongs should be handled by institutions within that specific region. Conclusion Regarding the state, I believe there are some activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice regardless of whether the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. This includes state activities to guarantee a certain egalitarian distribution of opportunity to acquire natural resources and state activities to guarantee a certain sufficientarian opportunity to acquire certain essential goods. Possibly, the state may also have a non-negotiable permission/obligation to provide and protect the institutions necessary to properly facilitate democratic decision making (if democracies are the best systems for determining the common interest/will of its citizens). There are also activities that the state is permitted/obligated to practice only if, and because, the activities serve the common interest or common will of its citizens. This includes enforcing the rules of collective property and regulating economic transactions that have sufficiently damaging negative externalities.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reasons Internalism: an argument by analogy with epistemic reasons</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Reasons-Internalism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reasons Internalism: an argument by analogy with epistemic reasons" /><published>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Reasons%20Internalism</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Reasons-Internalism.html">&lt;p&gt;The concept of a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; is ambiguous in the English language. When we talk about the reasons a person has, we are sometimes referring to &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;motivating&lt;/em&gt; reasons, which are often expressed by saying the “reason &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;” an agent did or will do something. Other times, we are referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/#NormReas&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;justifying&lt;/em&gt; reasons&lt;/a&gt;, which are often expressed by saying the “reason &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;” do something. Normative reasons are often said to be considerations (expressed as facts or propositions) that “count in favor” of a certain behavior. For example, imagine that John is hungry and is presented with poisonous food which he doesn’t know is poisonous. On the one hand, if he eats the food, we can posit an &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; reason for why he ate the food; the reason &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; John ate the food consists in the fact that he was hungry and he believed the food was not poisonous. This would be an answer to the question “Why &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; John eat the food?” On the other hand, we can also posit a &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;justifying&lt;/em&gt; reason to not eat the food; the reason &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; not eat the food consists in the fact that it is poisonous (combined with the fact that he probably doesn’t want to be poisoned). This would be an answer to the question “Why &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; John eat or not eat the food?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of normative reasons is a highly important issue within normative philosophy. Many philosophers have claimed that all normative domains (morality, epistemology, aesthetics, rationality, etc.) are intimately connected to reasons. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf&quot;&gt;Jonas Olson (2018)&lt;/a&gt; notes that “We talk about normative reasons when we say, for example, that there were no reasons to invade Iraq in 2003; when we say that there is reason to stay sober the night before a fi­nal exam; or when we say that there are reasons to believe that the universe is billions of years old. We can say that the first kind of normative reason is moral, the second pruden­tial, and the third epistemic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-internalism&quot;&gt;What is Internalism?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internalism is a thesis about the necessary conditions for an agent to have a normative reason. It is often formulated as a thesis about &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; reasons, which concern reasons for &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to, say, &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;epistemic&lt;/em&gt; reasons, which concern reasons for &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt;). Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/&quot;&gt;SEP article&lt;/a&gt; on internalism, reasons internalism states that all reasons for an agent to perform an action must bear some &lt;em&gt;special relation&lt;/em&gt; to some &lt;em&gt;motivational set&lt;/em&gt; of the agent (I borrow the phrasing “motivational set” from the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/WILIAE-2&quot;&gt;Internal and External Reasons&lt;/a&gt;” chapter in Bernard Williams’ 1979 book &lt;em&gt;Moral Luck&lt;/em&gt;). This is a highly generalized formulation of internalism. There are a wide variety of ways to understand internalism, by fleshing out what the “special relation” consists in and by fleshing out what the “motivational set” is taken to comprise (note that internalism as defined here is &lt;em&gt;existence&lt;/em&gt; internalism, which is not to be confused with &lt;em&gt;judgment&lt;/em&gt; internalism, which is a thesis about the necessary conditions for an agent to sincerely &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that someone has a reason).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest form of internalism states that agents only have reason to do what they desire to do. On this form of internalism, the relevant elements in the “motivational set” would be actions that the agent desires to do, and the “special relation” simply requires that reasons count in favor of performing an action in that set. Almost no one accepts this view, since there can plausibly be reasons for an agent to do things that he does not presently desire. For example, imagine John desires above everything else to eat a delicious burger and free delicious burgers are being offered by a nearby restaurant that John can reach with little cost to himself. It seems like there is some reason for him to go to the restaurant (to grab himself a free burger). However, assume that John is not aware that this restaurant exists, which means John has no desire to grab a free burger from this restaurant. The simplest form of internalism cannot account for the intuition that there is a reason for John to grab a free burger from the restaurant. A slightly improved version of internalism states that agents have reason to do an action that would satisfy a desire that they have. This would be able to account for the above case because John grabbing a free burger from the restaurant would satisfy one of his desires (even though he doesn’t know this). This also seems intuitively plausible for many of the reasons we ordinarily ascribe to people. For example, if Adam desires chocolate ice cream but Bob desires strawberry ice cream, it seems plausible to say that these agents have reason to consume different flavors of ice cream (chocolate for Adam, and strawberry for Bob) precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of their particular desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated forms of internalism appeal to more variations in the relevant “motivational set” and the “special relation”. For example, instead of using an agent’s &lt;em&gt;desires&lt;/em&gt; as the relevant elements in an agent’s motivational set, some theories appeal to other kinds of motivational states, such as an agent’s intentions, goals, emotions, or even their overall motivation. Also, the “special relation” is characterized differently as well; e.g. instead of using an agent’s &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; motivational features, some theories appeal to the motivational features that an agent &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have under certain &lt;em&gt;counterfactual&lt;/em&gt; idealized circumstances. For example, some theories posit that an agent’s reasons are determined by the motivational features (desires, intentions, motivations, etc.) that he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; hold under full information. This is used to prevent desires from generating reasons if those desires are based on false beliefs. Even more sophisticated theories appeal to the motivational features that an agent would hold while “fully rational”, under reflective equilibrium, under faultless deliberation from one’s current motivations, or countless other possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of different kinds of arguments for and against internalism. Some arguments are &lt;em&gt;extensional,&lt;/em&gt; i.e. they begin with considerations that intuitively &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to be reasons and argue that these are (or are not) best explained by internalism. For example, consider the fact that it seems that everyone, independently of their (actual or counterfactual) motivations, has &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; reason to take into account the well-being of others. Or consider that it seems everyone, independently of their (actual or counterfactual) motivations, has &lt;em&gt;prudential&lt;/em&gt; reason to take into account their &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; desires. Externalists often argue that these &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; reasons or &lt;em&gt;prudential&lt;/em&gt; reasons do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; depend on an agent’s (actual or counterfactual) motivations, which implies that internalism should be rejected (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#CenPro&quot;&gt;section 1.2.2&lt;/a&gt; of the SEP article on internalism for discussion of the tension between moral reasons and internalism; Derek Parfit discussed the tension between prudential reasons and internalism in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stafforini.com/docs//parfit_-_rationality_and_reasons.pdf&quot;&gt;Rationality and Reasons&lt;/a&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also non-extensional &lt;em&gt;conceptual&lt;/em&gt; arguments for and against internalism. For example, some internalists argue that there is a &lt;em&gt;conceptual&lt;/em&gt; connection between normative reasons and explanatory reasons. The motivation for one conceptual argument comes from considering first-personal reasons judgments. Typically, when an agent judges that they have a reason to perform an action, this judgment can be sufficient to motivate or explain their performance of that action. A similar general point is then applied to all &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; reasons: if fact p is a reason for an agent A to X, then A’s belief that p must be &lt;em&gt;capable&lt;/em&gt; of motivating A to X. But if the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#HumTheRea&quot;&gt;Humean Theory of Motivation&lt;/a&gt; is true, this is possible only if A has a current desire that would be served by X-ing. In conclusion, an agent has a reason to X only if X-ing engages in some way with an existing desire of the agent (this argument is given by Bernard Williams in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/WILIAE-2&quot;&gt;Internal and External Reasons&lt;/a&gt;” according to mainstream interpretations. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#MotArg&quot;&gt;section 2.1&lt;/a&gt; of the SEP article on internalism for discussion of this argument). I will not evaluate the merits of these extensional or conceptual arguments here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analogy-with-epistemic-reasons&quot;&gt;Analogy with epistemic reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will investigate how well internalism holds as a thesis regarding &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;epistemic&lt;/em&gt; reasons, i.e. reasons for &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason/#PraTheRea&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation of the distinction between theoretical and practical reasons). If internalism seems true regarding epistemic reasons, then that would provide some evidence that internalism is also true regarding practical reasons, as there would be a unified relation that could explain reasons more generally across different normative domains. All else equal, a theory that can explain observations across a wide variety of general contexts in a non-ad-hoc fashion has more plausibility than a theory that must posit many different independent explanations to account for those same observations. On the other hand, if internalism seems false regarding epistemic reasons, then internalists will need to provide an explanation of why &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; are relevantly different enough to demand different &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; conditions for their reasons. But it’s not clear to me how such an explanation can be given. After all, the concept of a &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; is the same when discussing normative reasons for action and normative reasons for belief. Thus, we would expect the &lt;em&gt;fundamental&lt;/em&gt; conditions that govern the presence of reasons to be the same as well. It seems to me then that the viability of internalism rests in part on the success of internalism as a theory regarding epistemic reasons. In what follows, I will argue that internalism &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; plausible regarding epistemic reasons. Also, I will use “epistemic internalism” to refer to internalism as a theory about reasons for belief, and “practical internalism” internalism as a theory about reasons for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desire-based-epistemic-reasons&quot;&gt;Desire-based epistemic reasons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it seems immediately implausible to suppose that internalism is true regarding reasons for belief. Whether or not a person has reason for a belief depends on whether that belief fits their evidence. People who form beliefs based on their desires or some other element of their motivational set (rather than evidence) are epistemically &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt;. Pragmatic benefits (such as whether something satisfies your desires) might be good reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;, but they are the &lt;em&gt;wrong kind of reason&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; (read “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/664753&quot;&gt;The Ubiquity of State-Given Reasons&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark Schroeder for a good explanation of the Wrong Kind of Reason problem). There are a few ways that an epistemic internalist might account for this intuitive implausibility. One way is to say that we ascribe reasons for belief to an agent on the assumption that the agent has a desire for truth. Another way might be to say that we ascribe reasons for belief to an agent on the assumption that the agent has some desire(s) that would be served by holding true beliefs. The idea is that there needs to be particular elements in one’s motivational set in order for them to have any particular reason for belief (examples of authors advancing these arguments can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#AnaTheRea&quot;&gt;section 2.2&lt;/a&gt; of the SEP article on reasons internalism). Thus, epistemic reasons would be internal, but the relevant “motivational set” would be a special subset of an agent’s motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us assume that epistemic reasons are internal in the sense just mentioned. This would make epistemic internal reasons function quite differently than practical internal reasons. Practical internal reasons can be generated by almost &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; ordinary element of someone’s (actual or counterfactual) motivational set. In the case of epistemic reasons, however, ordinary desires will typically fail to generate reason for belief. For example, if a person desires to feel secure, and if they would feel extremely secure if they believed in the existence of a benevolent God, this would not provide them with &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to believe that such a God exists. In other words, if they believed a benevolent God exists &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; such a belief satisfied one of their desires, then this would intuitively be an example of an &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt; belief. This creates a few mysteries for epistemic internalism: why do only &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; desires (e.g. desires for truth, or desires that would be satisfied by believing true propositions) have a privileged status as being capable of generating reasons for belief, whereas &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; desires (e.g. desires for feeling secure) do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have this status? Also, why are reasons for belief generated by such a small subset of specific desires, whereas reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; can be generated by a much larger range of an agent’s motivations? This distinction seems unwarranted and &lt;em&gt;ad-hoc&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. it is posited merely to patch up unintuitive parts of the theory, even though it is not otherwise motivated by the theory itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An epistemic internalist might try to avoid these problems by denying that they assign a special privilege to certain desires, thereby avoiding the charge of being ad-hoc. They might say that, under epistemic internalism, like practical internalism, most ordinary desires &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; generate reasons. They might say that the desire to feel secure &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; generate &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; reason to believe in a benevolent God, but that this reason is &lt;em&gt;outweighed&lt;/em&gt; by the reasons generated by other desires (e.g. desires for truth, or desires that would be satisfied by believing the truth). This way, the epistemic internalist avoids the charge of privileging certain desires in an ad-hoc attempt to avoid unintuitive conclusions. However, I believe that there are two problems with this reply by the epistemic internalist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it is not clear why the reason based on, say, the desire for truth should &lt;em&gt;outweigh&lt;/em&gt; the reason based on the desire to feel secure in this particular example. On a straightforward account of how to “weigh” reasons generated by desires, the &lt;em&gt;strongest&lt;/em&gt; desires are the ones with the most weight. But it seems plausible that (in this particular example, at least) a person might have a stronger desire to feel secure than a desire for truth. Or, more precisely, it seems that the desires that are satisfied when one believes in a benevolent God (e.g. the desire to feel secure) could be stronger than the desires that would be satisfied otherwise (e.g. the desires for truth). Yet, even when this is true, it still seems that belief in a benevolent God (on the basis of a desire to feel secure) is (epistemically) irrational.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More importantly, it seems more plausible to say that the desire to feel secure does not provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reason to believe in a benevolent God. In other words, this desire is not the sort of consideration that is relevant &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; to whether someone has reason to believe a proposition. Insofar as someone were to consider their desire to feel secure when reasoning as to whether to believe in a benevolent God, this would be an &lt;em&gt;irrational&lt;/em&gt; aspect of their epistemic reasoning, even if this consideration were outweighed by other stronger desires (e.g. desires to form true beliefs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it seems that the vast majority of desires are &lt;em&gt;fundamentally inappropriate&lt;/em&gt; to generate reasons for belief, independent of how strong the desires may be. On the other hand, the majority of ordinary desires do generate &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; reason for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;. This is a problem for a desire-based theory of epistemic reasons because it reveals a sharp disconnect between the conditions regarding reasons for beliefs and the conditions regarding reasons for action. And it doesn’t seem that a desire-based theory of epistemic reasons can explain this disconnect in a non-ad-hoc fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;epistemic-analog-to-the-motivational-set&quot;&gt;Epistemic analog to the motivational set&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the argument given above, I believe that we should conclude that an agent’s epistemic reasons are not based on their desires. Similar arguments can also be used against forms of epistemic internalism that connect epistemic reasons with other ordinary elements of one’s (actual or counterfactual) motivational set, e.g. intentions, goals, emotions, motivations, etc. None of these motivational elements seem appropriate to ground one’s reasons for belief. It may seem that internalism about epistemic reasons is thus implausible, providing evidence against internalism generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps not. The above issues merely indicate that an agent’s reasons for beliefs do not stand in a special relation to the agent’s motivational set. But perhaps all of an agent’s reasons for beliefs &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand in a special relation to a different kind of set, a set which is the &lt;em&gt;epistemic analog&lt;/em&gt; to the motivational set discussed thus far; call this the &lt;em&gt;epistemic motivational set&lt;/em&gt;. For clarity, from this point on, I will refer to the motivational set discussed thus far as the &lt;em&gt;practical motivational set.&lt;/em&gt; The practical motivational set is the same set I’ve discussed so far: it consists of the motivations, desires, goals, intentions, and all of the other considerations which dispose an agent toward certain &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;intentions&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, the &lt;em&gt;epistemic motivational set&lt;/em&gt; consists of beliefs, experiences, perceptions, intuitions, and all of the other considerations which dispose an agent toward certain &lt;em&gt;beliefs.&lt;/em&gt; Now, a unified internalism for both epistemic and practical reasons can state the following: just as all reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; must bear some special relation to an agent’s &lt;em&gt;practical motivational set&lt;/em&gt;, all reasons for &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; must bear some special relation to an agent’s &lt;em&gt;epistemic motivational set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is intuitively plausible to me. Most theories of epistemic justification agree that all reasons for belief must bear some special relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/&quot;&gt;Coherentism&lt;/a&gt; posits that one is justified in believing P (i.e. one has reason to believe P) only if P coheres with one’s other beliefs (beliefs are included in one’s epistemic motivational set). On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/&quot;&gt;Foundationalism&lt;/a&gt; posits that one is justified in believing P only if P follows from a foundation of non-inferential knowledge or justified beliefs (non-inferential knowledge includes elements like perception, which falls under the epistemic motivational set). Any considerations which do not bear any relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set cannot be a reason for that agent to hold any belief. For example, if a certain proposition P is true but it has no relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set (i.e. their beliefs, perceptions, experiences, etc.), then it seems plausible to say there is no reason for the agent to believe P (despite it being true). For example, it might be true that there are exactly 23,538 planets with life in our galaxy, but (assuming this fact has no influence on our observations or perceptions and we don’t have non-inferential knowledge of this fact) there is no reason for any humans today to believe that; anyone who did believe that would be unjustified (even though their belief would be true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;global-internalism&quot;&gt;Global Internalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can generalize this kind of reasoning in at least two ways. Firstly, we can apply this kind of framework to attitudes other than belief and action/intention to form a kind of global internalism. For example, an internalist theory about normative attitudes broadly might say: all reasons to adopt attitude X (an intention, action, belief, emotion, desire, fears, etc.) must bear some special relation to the agent’s motivational set for attitude X. The motivational set for attitude X includes all features of the agent that disposes the agent toward or away from adopting the attitude. X in this case can be any attitude for which normative reasons make sense. I believe this class of attitudes is best described by what Thomas Scanlon calls “judgment-sensitive attitudes” in Chapter 1 of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/SCAWWO&quot;&gt;What We Owe to Each Other&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; these are attitudes whose presence in an agent can be influenced by that agent’s judgment regarding one’s normative reasons to adopt those attitudes. Scanlon provides more details on this class of attitudes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The class of attitudes for which reasons in the sense I have in mind can sensibly be asked for or offered can be characterized, with apparent but I think innocent circularity, as the class of “judgment-sensitive attitudes.” These are attitudes that an ideally rational person would come to have whenever that person judged there to be sufficient reasons for them and that would, in an ideally rational person, “extinguish” when that person judged them not to be supported by reasons of the appropriate kind. Hunger is obviously not a judgment-sensitive attitude; but belief is, and so are fear, anger, admiration, respect, and other evaluative attitudes such as the view that fame is worth seeking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other opportunity for generalization offered by this global internalism is the ability to adopt a central conception of the “special relation” that can be applied to all judgment-sensitive attitudes. This suggests that there is a common normative &lt;em&gt;faculty&lt;/em&gt; articulated by the “special relation” that determines the appropriateness or justification of an attitude, independent of the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of attitude that it is (whether it’s a belief, intention, fear, etc.). This seems to be what we are getting at when we refer to a general faculty of &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the faculty under exercise when one is in the act of &lt;em&gt;reasoning&lt;/em&gt;. Reason, understood as this general faculty, can be interpreted as a faculty that begins with a starting set of motivations (e.g. desires, goals, etc. for practical reasoning, or beliefs, perceptions, intuitions, etc. for epistemic reasoning) and makes determinations about what final attitudes &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; from that starting motivational set. When an agent exercises this faculty, i.e. when an agent is reasoning, the upshot is a judgment about what he has &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to do. The &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; reasons that an agent has is determined by what an agent would conclude if he were to exercise this faculty &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, reasons are the upshots of the &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; exercise of the faculty of reason. Conceptions of the “special relation” can be seen as attempts to articulate the proper functions of this faculty. Reasons, then, can be said to be the &lt;em&gt;rational extension&lt;/em&gt; of one’s starting motivational set (the idea that &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; are intimately connected to &lt;em&gt;rationality&lt;/em&gt; is one of the key motivations for internalism).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one might adopt a coherentist theory of rationality. This might be expressed as: a consideration C is a reason for any arbitrary attitude X if and only if C coheres with all of the elements in the motivational set of attitude X. This is a well-known theory of justification when applied to beliefs (i.e. coherentism). But it could also work as a theory of justification when applied to intentions, i.e. one has reason to intend X if it “coheres with” their intentions, goals, desires, etc. (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/~msmith/mypapers/Smith-Valuing-1995.pdf&quot;&gt;Michael Smith (1995)&lt;/a&gt; has argued that consistency and coherence are standards that justify our desires). Perhaps similar considerations can be applied to aesthetics (which are concerned with reasons to &lt;em&gt;admire&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;appreciate&lt;/em&gt; certain objects) or to our reactive attitudes (e.g. reasons to &lt;em&gt;blame&lt;/em&gt; someone, reasons to feel &lt;em&gt;guilt&lt;/em&gt;, etc.). Once one fleshes out what coherence (or some other theory of justification) actually consists in, perhaps this single conception of justification can unify reasons across all normative domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;degenerate-motivations&quot;&gt;Degenerate Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said recently that the motivational set for an attitude includes all elements that dispose the agent toward or away from adopting the attitude. The motivational set will actually need to be more strict in order for global internalism to be plausible. Recall that I argued above that desire-based reasons for belief are implausible. While desires should not constitute &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; reasons for belief, they often constitute &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; (albeit subconscious) reasons for belief. For example, people are highly unlikely to rid themselves of beliefs that are intimately tied to their identity (e.g. political or religious beliefs), despite ample evidence being presented to the contrary. Of course, people tend not to &lt;em&gt;consciously take&lt;/em&gt; the fact that a belief is tied to their identity to be a reason to hold the belief, but this fact nevertheless plays a role in explaining their tendency to hold the belief. Thus, the subconscious tendency to protect one’s identity is an extremely strong element in many people’s epistemic motivational set. But this tendency does not provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; epistemic reason for belief. Similar examples can also be found regarding reasons for action. For example, imagine a drug addict hates his addiction but nevertheless constantly injects himself with the drug because of his addiction. This person’s physical addiction would constitute an extremely strong element in his practical motivational set. Nevertheless, unwanted addictions do not provide &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; practical reason to inject heroin. Generally speaking, it seems that agents can have &lt;em&gt;degenerate&lt;/em&gt; motivational features that do not provide them with any normative reasons despite their motivational strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to account for these degenerate elements is to characterize the “special relation” such that we are only concerned with the relevant motivational features of the agent under &lt;em&gt;idealized&lt;/em&gt; conditions. But how are we to characterize the “idealized” conditions? On the one hand, we could characterize the “idealized” conditions in normative terms, i.e. by saying that the idealized conditions are conditions where agents are “fully virtuous” or “fully receptive to their reasons”, etc. The problem with this is that it allows for normative truths that are prior to reasons, but this conflicts with the (what I take to be plausible) idea that all normative concepts can be expressed using the concept of reasons. Further, once we open the door to externalist sources of normativity generally, we also open the door to externalist sources of reasons specifically. On the other hand, we could explicitly exclude all instances of such “degenerate” motivations from the ideal conditions. For example, we could exclude all of what Michael Smith calls “physical addictions”, “emotional disturbances” and “psychological compulsions” from the ideal conditions (see chapter 5 of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Problem-Michael-Smith/dp/0631192468&quot;&gt;The Moral Problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). But how do we determine what kinds of motivations are emotional disturbances or psychological compulsions? There doesn’t seem to be a general answer. Further, we would need to exclude more motivations to account for epistemic reasons, e.g. agents in the ideal conditions will not have their beliefs influenced by their identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we plug in more and more constraints into the ideal conditions, this defeats one of the main attractions of internalism, which was that it can provide a simple unified relation to explain the normative reasons we have in a non-ad-hoc fashion. But this explanatory power is lost if the theory has to make endless assumptions about what reasons we have prior to “explaining” them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;constructivism&quot;&gt;Constructivism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we should not account for the degenerate motivational features of an agent by explicitly excluding specific kinds of motivations from the idealized conditions. Instead, I believe there is a promising strategy for removing degenerate elements that provides a unified account of all normative reasons in a non-ad-hoc fashion. The strategy is to limit the motivational set to an agent’s &lt;em&gt;normative judgments&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the agent’s own personal judgments about the reasons they have. This allows us to accommodate the above examples of degenerate motivations. For example, an agent does not have reason to form beliefs on the basis of protecting their identity because the agent, &lt;em&gt;by their own lights,&lt;/em&gt; probably judges that it is irrational to do so (typically, people will deny that their beliefs are based on protecting their identity. Even when a person’s beliefs &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; based on protecting their identity, they &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; their beliefs are based on the evidence). Similarly, an agent who hates their drug addiction does not have reason to inject heroin because the agent, &lt;em&gt;by their own lights&lt;/em&gt;, does not &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; their drive to inject the heroin, i.e. the agent judges that they don’t have reason to inject the heroin. The motivation for limiting the motivational set to the agent’s normative judgments is based on the insight that not all motivations are &lt;em&gt;rational motivations&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. motivations that an agent forms &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; what they take themselves to have reason to do. It seems that &lt;em&gt;non-rational&lt;/em&gt; motivations - e.g. physical addictions, psychological compulsions, beliefs based on non-evidential considerations, etc. - never actually provide agents with reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in order for this theory to qualify as a form of internalism, &lt;em&gt;normative judgments&lt;/em&gt; must be elements of one’s motivational set, which means that normative judgments must be inherently motivating. This is a thesis known as &lt;em&gt;judgment&lt;/em&gt; internalism (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-motivation/#IntVExt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/#MotIntActGuiChaMorJud&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for brief discussion), which I personally endorse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that normative reasons bear a special relation to one’s normative judgments is the basis of a metaethical theory called constructivism. Sharon Street articulates in “&lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/STRCAR-4&quot;&gt;Constructivism about Reasons&lt;/a&gt;” the central thesis of constructivism as follows: “the fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A’s other judgments about reasons.” Whether a judgment “withstands scrutiny” from other judgments is supposed to be a descriptive fact that can be determined without any normative assumptions. In brief, a judgment withstands scrutiny from other judgments held by an agent if the agent in question could hold all the judgments in full awareness. Note that this allows that agents can be incorrect about their reasons because agents often are not in full awareness of their judgments. Much more needs to be said about this and whether constructivism is a plausible theory. I hope to speak more about the merits of constructivism in a future post. I mention it here only to outline a possible strategy for a global internalist theory of reasons to account for degenerate motivations in a unified, non-ad-hoc fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical internalism already has an attraction over externalism in that it can describe a single relation in virtue of which all of our practical reasons are grounded. Externalism, on the other hand, needs to posit multiple independent properties or relations to ground our practical reasons. Further, the fact that internalism can potentially ground reasons in other normative domains (e.g. with regard to reasons for belief) provides very strong evidence in favor of internalism with regard to reasons for action. All else equal, a theory that can explain observations across a wide variety of contexts in a non-ad-hoc fashion has more plausibility than a theory that must posit many different independent explanations to account for those same observations. Thus, if everything I’ve said in this post is correct regarding the viability of epistemic internalism, externalists must show that all else is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal. That is, an externalist must provide an explanation for why beliefs and actions are sufficiently different such that internalism is viable for the former attitudes but not the latter attitudes. As stated before, such an explanation seems implausible because the concept of a normative &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; is the same when we speak of reasons for beliefs and reasons for action. In any event, until such an explanation is provided, it seems that the more plausible route is to adopt internalism as a theory of reasons for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">The concept of a reason is ambiguous in the English language. When we talk about the reasons a person has, we are sometimes referring to explanatory or motivating reasons, which are often expressed by saying the “reason that” an agent did or will do something. Other times, we are referring to normative or justifying reasons, which are often expressed by saying the “reason to” do something. Normative reasons are often said to be considerations (expressed as facts or propositions) that “count in favor” of a certain behavior. For example, imagine that John is hungry and is presented with poisonous food which he doesn’t know is poisonous. On the one hand, if he eats the food, we can posit an explanatory reason for why he ate the food; the reason that John ate the food consists in the fact that he was hungry and he believed the food was not poisonous. This would be an answer to the question “Why did John eat the food?” On the other hand, we can also posit a normative or justifying reason to not eat the food; the reason to not eat the food consists in the fact that it is poisonous (combined with the fact that he probably doesn’t want to be poisoned). This would be an answer to the question “Why should John eat or not eat the food?” The nature of normative reasons is a highly important issue within normative philosophy. Many philosophers have claimed that all normative domains (morality, epistemology, aesthetics, rationality, etc.) are intimately connected to reasons. For example, Jonas Olson (2018) notes that “We talk about normative reasons when we say, for example, that there were no reasons to invade Iraq in 2003; when we say that there is reason to stay sober the night before a fi­nal exam; or when we say that there are reasons to believe that the universe is billions of years old. We can say that the first kind of normative reason is moral, the second pruden­tial, and the third epistemic”. What is Internalism? Internalism is a thesis about the necessary conditions for an agent to have a normative reason. It is often formulated as a thesis about practical reasons, which concern reasons for actions or intentions (as opposed to, say, theoretical or epistemic reasons, which concern reasons for beliefs). Following the SEP article on internalism, reasons internalism states that all reasons for an agent to perform an action must bear some special relation to some motivational set of the agent (I borrow the phrasing “motivational set” from the “Internal and External Reasons” chapter in Bernard Williams’ 1979 book Moral Luck). This is a highly generalized formulation of internalism. There are a wide variety of ways to understand internalism, by fleshing out what the “special relation” consists in and by fleshing out what the “motivational set” is taken to comprise (note that internalism as defined here is existence internalism, which is not to be confused with judgment internalism, which is a thesis about the necessary conditions for an agent to sincerely judge or believe that someone has a reason). The simplest form of internalism states that agents only have reason to do what they desire to do. On this form of internalism, the relevant elements in the “motivational set” would be actions that the agent desires to do, and the “special relation” simply requires that reasons count in favor of performing an action in that set. Almost no one accepts this view, since there can plausibly be reasons for an agent to do things that he does not presently desire. For example, imagine John desires above everything else to eat a delicious burger and free delicious burgers are being offered by a nearby restaurant that John can reach with little cost to himself. It seems like there is some reason for him to go to the restaurant (to grab himself a free burger). However, assume that John is not aware that this restaurant exists, which means John has no desire to grab a free burger from this restaurant. The simplest form of internalism cannot account for the intuition that there is a reason for John to grab a free burger from the restaurant. A slightly improved version of internalism states that agents have reason to do an action that would satisfy a desire that they have. This would be able to account for the above case because John grabbing a free burger from the restaurant would satisfy one of his desires (even though he doesn’t know this). This also seems intuitively plausible for many of the reasons we ordinarily ascribe to people. For example, if Adam desires chocolate ice cream but Bob desires strawberry ice cream, it seems plausible to say that these agents have reason to consume different flavors of ice cream (chocolate for Adam, and strawberry for Bob) precisely because of their particular desires. More sophisticated forms of internalism appeal to more variations in the relevant “motivational set” and the “special relation”. For example, instead of using an agent’s desires as the relevant elements in an agent’s motivational set, some theories appeal to other kinds of motivational states, such as an agent’s intentions, goals, emotions, or even their overall motivation. Also, the “special relation” is characterized differently as well; e.g. instead of using an agent’s actual motivational features, some theories appeal to the motivational features that an agent would have under certain counterfactual idealized circumstances. For example, some theories posit that an agent’s reasons are determined by the motivational features (desires, intentions, motivations, etc.) that he would hold under full information. This is used to prevent desires from generating reasons if those desires are based on false beliefs. Even more sophisticated theories appeal to the motivational features that an agent would hold while “fully rational”, under reflective equilibrium, under faultless deliberation from one’s current motivations, or countless other possibilities. There are a variety of different kinds of arguments for and against internalism. Some arguments are extensional, i.e. they begin with considerations that intuitively seem to be reasons and argue that these are (or are not) best explained by internalism. For example, consider the fact that it seems that everyone, independently of their (actual or counterfactual) motivations, has moral reason to take into account the well-being of others. Or consider that it seems everyone, independently of their (actual or counterfactual) motivations, has prudential reason to take into account their future desires. Externalists often argue that these moral reasons or prudential reasons do not depend on an agent’s (actual or counterfactual) motivations, which implies that internalism should be rejected (see section 1.2.2 of the SEP article on internalism for discussion of the tension between moral reasons and internalism; Derek Parfit discussed the tension between prudential reasons and internalism in “Rationality and Reasons”). There are also non-extensional conceptual arguments for and against internalism. For example, some internalists argue that there is a conceptual connection between normative reasons and explanatory reasons. The motivation for one conceptual argument comes from considering first-personal reasons judgments. Typically, when an agent judges that they have a reason to perform an action, this judgment can be sufficient to motivate or explain their performance of that action. A similar general point is then applied to all actual reasons: if fact p is a reason for an agent A to X, then A’s belief that p must be capable of motivating A to X. But if the Humean Theory of Motivation is true, this is possible only if A has a current desire that would be served by X-ing. In conclusion, an agent has a reason to X only if X-ing engages in some way with an existing desire of the agent (this argument is given by Bernard Williams in “Internal and External Reasons” according to mainstream interpretations. See section 2.1 of the SEP article on internalism for discussion of this argument). I will not evaluate the merits of these extensional or conceptual arguments here. Analogy with epistemic reasons I will investigate how well internalism holds as a thesis regarding theoretical or epistemic reasons, i.e. reasons for belief (see here for an explanation of the distinction between theoretical and practical reasons). If internalism seems true regarding epistemic reasons, then that would provide some evidence that internalism is also true regarding practical reasons, as there would be a unified relation that could explain reasons more generally across different normative domains. All else equal, a theory that can explain observations across a wide variety of general contexts in a non-ad-hoc fashion has more plausibility than a theory that must posit many different independent explanations to account for those same observations. On the other hand, if internalism seems false regarding epistemic reasons, then internalists will need to provide an explanation of why actions and beliefs are relevantly different enough to demand different fundamental conditions for their reasons. But it’s not clear to me how such an explanation can be given. After all, the concept of a reason is the same when discussing normative reasons for action and normative reasons for belief. Thus, we would expect the fundamental conditions that govern the presence of reasons to be the same as well. It seems to me then that the viability of internalism rests in part on the success of internalism as a theory regarding epistemic reasons. In what follows, I will argue that internalism is plausible regarding epistemic reasons. Also, I will use “epistemic internalism” to refer to internalism as a theory about reasons for belief, and “practical internalism” internalism as a theory about reasons for action. Desire-based epistemic reasons On the surface, it seems immediately implausible to suppose that internalism is true regarding reasons for belief. Whether or not a person has reason for a belief depends on whether that belief fits their evidence. People who form beliefs based on their desires or some other element of their motivational set (rather than evidence) are epistemically irrational. Pragmatic benefits (such as whether something satisfies your desires) might be good reasons for action, but they are the wrong kind of reason for belief (read “The Ubiquity of State-Given Reasons” by Mark Schroeder for a good explanation of the Wrong Kind of Reason problem). There are a few ways that an epistemic internalist might account for this intuitive implausibility. One way is to say that we ascribe reasons for belief to an agent on the assumption that the agent has a desire for truth. Another way might be to say that we ascribe reasons for belief to an agent on the assumption that the agent has some desire(s) that would be served by holding true beliefs. The idea is that there needs to be particular elements in one’s motivational set in order for them to have any particular reason for belief (examples of authors advancing these arguments can be found in section 2.2 of the SEP article on reasons internalism). Thus, epistemic reasons would be internal, but the relevant “motivational set” would be a special subset of an agent’s motivations. Let us assume that epistemic reasons are internal in the sense just mentioned. This would make epistemic internal reasons function quite differently than practical internal reasons. Practical internal reasons can be generated by almost any ordinary element of someone’s (actual or counterfactual) motivational set. In the case of epistemic reasons, however, ordinary desires will typically fail to generate reason for belief. For example, if a person desires to feel secure, and if they would feel extremely secure if they believed in the existence of a benevolent God, this would not provide them with reason to believe that such a God exists. In other words, if they believed a benevolent God exists because such a belief satisfied one of their desires, then this would intuitively be an example of an irrational belief. This creates a few mysteries for epistemic internalism: why do only certain desires (e.g. desires for truth, or desires that would be satisfied by believing true propositions) have a privileged status as being capable of generating reasons for belief, whereas other desires (e.g. desires for feeling secure) do not have this status? Also, why are reasons for belief generated by such a small subset of specific desires, whereas reasons for action can be generated by a much larger range of an agent’s motivations? This distinction seems unwarranted and ad-hoc (i.e. it is posited merely to patch up unintuitive parts of the theory, even though it is not otherwise motivated by the theory itself). An epistemic internalist might try to avoid these problems by denying that they assign a special privilege to certain desires, thereby avoiding the charge of being ad-hoc. They might say that, under epistemic internalism, like practical internalism, most ordinary desires do generate reasons. They might say that the desire to feel secure does generate some reason to believe in a benevolent God, but that this reason is outweighed by the reasons generated by other desires (e.g. desires for truth, or desires that would be satisfied by believing the truth). This way, the epistemic internalist avoids the charge of privileging certain desires in an ad-hoc attempt to avoid unintuitive conclusions. However, I believe that there are two problems with this reply by the epistemic internalist: it is not clear why the reason based on, say, the desire for truth should outweigh the reason based on the desire to feel secure in this particular example. On a straightforward account of how to “weigh” reasons generated by desires, the strongest desires are the ones with the most weight. But it seems plausible that (in this particular example, at least) a person might have a stronger desire to feel secure than a desire for truth. Or, more precisely, it seems that the desires that are satisfied when one believes in a benevolent God (e.g. the desire to feel secure) could be stronger than the desires that would be satisfied otherwise (e.g. the desires for truth). Yet, even when this is true, it still seems that belief in a benevolent God (on the basis of a desire to feel secure) is (epistemically) irrational. More importantly, it seems more plausible to say that the desire to feel secure does not provide any reason to believe in a benevolent God. In other words, this desire is not the sort of consideration that is relevant at all to whether someone has reason to believe a proposition. Insofar as someone were to consider their desire to feel secure when reasoning as to whether to believe in a benevolent God, this would be an irrational aspect of their epistemic reasoning, even if this consideration were outweighed by other stronger desires (e.g. desires to form true beliefs). In general, it seems that the vast majority of desires are fundamentally inappropriate to generate reasons for belief, independent of how strong the desires may be. On the other hand, the majority of ordinary desires do generate some reason for action. This is a problem for a desire-based theory of epistemic reasons because it reveals a sharp disconnect between the conditions regarding reasons for beliefs and the conditions regarding reasons for action. And it doesn’t seem that a desire-based theory of epistemic reasons can explain this disconnect in a non-ad-hoc fashion. Epistemic analog to the motivational set Due to the argument given above, I believe that we should conclude that an agent’s epistemic reasons are not based on their desires. Similar arguments can also be used against forms of epistemic internalism that connect epistemic reasons with other ordinary elements of one’s (actual or counterfactual) motivational set, e.g. intentions, goals, emotions, motivations, etc. None of these motivational elements seem appropriate to ground one’s reasons for belief. It may seem that internalism about epistemic reasons is thus implausible, providing evidence against internalism generally. But perhaps not. The above issues merely indicate that an agent’s reasons for beliefs do not stand in a special relation to the agent’s motivational set. But perhaps all of an agent’s reasons for beliefs do stand in a special relation to a different kind of set, a set which is the epistemic analog to the motivational set discussed thus far; call this the epistemic motivational set. For clarity, from this point on, I will refer to the motivational set discussed thus far as the practical motivational set. The practical motivational set is the same set I’ve discussed so far: it consists of the motivations, desires, goals, intentions, and all of the other considerations which dispose an agent toward certain actions or intentions. Similarly, the epistemic motivational set consists of beliefs, experiences, perceptions, intuitions, and all of the other considerations which dispose an agent toward certain beliefs. Now, a unified internalism for both epistemic and practical reasons can state the following: just as all reasons for action must bear some special relation to an agent’s practical motivational set, all reasons for belief must bear some special relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set. This is intuitively plausible to me. Most theories of epistemic justification agree that all reasons for belief must bear some special relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set. For example, Coherentism posits that one is justified in believing P (i.e. one has reason to believe P) only if P coheres with one’s other beliefs (beliefs are included in one’s epistemic motivational set). On the other hand, Foundationalism posits that one is justified in believing P only if P follows from a foundation of non-inferential knowledge or justified beliefs (non-inferential knowledge includes elements like perception, which falls under the epistemic motivational set). Any considerations which do not bear any relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set cannot be a reason for that agent to hold any belief. For example, if a certain proposition P is true but it has no relation to an agent’s epistemic motivational set (i.e. their beliefs, perceptions, experiences, etc.), then it seems plausible to say there is no reason for the agent to believe P (despite it being true). For example, it might be true that there are exactly 23,538 planets with life in our galaxy, but (assuming this fact has no influence on our observations or perceptions and we don’t have non-inferential knowledge of this fact) there is no reason for any humans today to believe that; anyone who did believe that would be unjustified (even though their belief would be true). Global Internalism We can generalize this kind of reasoning in at least two ways. Firstly, we can apply this kind of framework to attitudes other than belief and action/intention to form a kind of global internalism. For example, an internalist theory about normative attitudes broadly might say: all reasons to adopt attitude X (an intention, action, belief, emotion, desire, fears, etc.) must bear some special relation to the agent’s motivational set for attitude X. The motivational set for attitude X includes all features of the agent that disposes the agent toward or away from adopting the attitude. X in this case can be any attitude for which normative reasons make sense. I believe this class of attitudes is best described by what Thomas Scanlon calls “judgment-sensitive attitudes” in Chapter 1 of What We Owe to Each Other; these are attitudes whose presence in an agent can be influenced by that agent’s judgment regarding one’s normative reasons to adopt those attitudes. Scanlon provides more details on this class of attitudes: The class of attitudes for which reasons in the sense I have in mind can sensibly be asked for or offered can be characterized, with apparent but I think innocent circularity, as the class of “judgment-sensitive attitudes.” These are attitudes that an ideally rational person would come to have whenever that person judged there to be sufficient reasons for them and that would, in an ideally rational person, “extinguish” when that person judged them not to be supported by reasons of the appropriate kind. Hunger is obviously not a judgment-sensitive attitude; but belief is, and so are fear, anger, admiration, respect, and other evaluative attitudes such as the view that fame is worth seeking The other opportunity for generalization offered by this global internalism is the ability to adopt a central conception of the “special relation” that can be applied to all judgment-sensitive attitudes. This suggests that there is a common normative faculty articulated by the “special relation” that determines the appropriateness or justification of an attitude, independent of the type of attitude that it is (whether it’s a belief, intention, fear, etc.). This seems to be what we are getting at when we refer to a general faculty of reason, i.e. the faculty under exercise when one is in the act of reasoning. Reason, understood as this general faculty, can be interpreted as a faculty that begins with a starting set of motivations (e.g. desires, goals, etc. for practical reasoning, or beliefs, perceptions, intuitions, etc. for epistemic reasoning) and makes determinations about what final attitudes follow from that starting motivational set. When an agent exercises this faculty, i.e. when an agent is reasoning, the upshot is a judgment about what he has reason to do. The actual reasons that an agent has is determined by what an agent would conclude if he were to exercise this faculty well. In other words, reasons are the upshots of the proper exercise of the faculty of reason. Conceptions of the “special relation” can be seen as attempts to articulate the proper functions of this faculty. Reasons, then, can be said to be the rational extension of one’s starting motivational set (the idea that reasons are intimately connected to rationality is one of the key motivations for internalism). For example, one might adopt a coherentist theory of rationality. This might be expressed as: a consideration C is a reason for any arbitrary attitude X if and only if C coheres with all of the elements in the motivational set of attitude X. This is a well-known theory of justification when applied to beliefs (i.e. coherentism). But it could also work as a theory of justification when applied to intentions, i.e. one has reason to intend X if it “coheres with” their intentions, goals, desires, etc. (e.g. Michael Smith (1995) has argued that consistency and coherence are standards that justify our desires). Perhaps similar considerations can be applied to aesthetics (which are concerned with reasons to admire or appreciate certain objects) or to our reactive attitudes (e.g. reasons to blame someone, reasons to feel guilt, etc.). Once one fleshes out what coherence (or some other theory of justification) actually consists in, perhaps this single conception of justification can unify reasons across all normative domains. Degenerate Motivations I said recently that the motivational set for an attitude includes all elements that dispose the agent toward or away from adopting the attitude. The motivational set will actually need to be more strict in order for global internalism to be plausible. Recall that I argued above that desire-based reasons for belief are implausible. While desires should not constitute normative reasons for belief, they often constitute explanatory (albeit subconscious) reasons for belief. For example, people are highly unlikely to rid themselves of beliefs that are intimately tied to their identity (e.g. political or religious beliefs), despite ample evidence being presented to the contrary. Of course, people tend not to consciously take the fact that a belief is tied to their identity to be a reason to hold the belief, but this fact nevertheless plays a role in explaining their tendency to hold the belief. Thus, the subconscious tendency to protect one’s identity is an extremely strong element in many people’s epistemic motivational set. But this tendency does not provide any epistemic reason for belief. Similar examples can also be found regarding reasons for action. For example, imagine a drug addict hates his addiction but nevertheless constantly injects himself with the drug because of his addiction. This person’s physical addiction would constitute an extremely strong element in his practical motivational set. Nevertheless, unwanted addictions do not provide any practical reason to inject heroin. Generally speaking, it seems that agents can have degenerate motivational features that do not provide them with any normative reasons despite their motivational strength. One way to account for these degenerate elements is to characterize the “special relation” such that we are only concerned with the relevant motivational features of the agent under idealized conditions. But how are we to characterize the “idealized” conditions? On the one hand, we could characterize the “idealized” conditions in normative terms, i.e. by saying that the idealized conditions are conditions where agents are “fully virtuous” or “fully receptive to their reasons”, etc. The problem with this is that it allows for normative truths that are prior to reasons, but this conflicts with the (what I take to be plausible) idea that all normative concepts can be expressed using the concept of reasons. Further, once we open the door to externalist sources of normativity generally, we also open the door to externalist sources of reasons specifically. On the other hand, we could explicitly exclude all instances of such “degenerate” motivations from the ideal conditions. For example, we could exclude all of what Michael Smith calls “physical addictions”, “emotional disturbances” and “psychological compulsions” from the ideal conditions (see chapter 5 of The Moral Problem). But how do we determine what kinds of motivations are emotional disturbances or psychological compulsions? There doesn’t seem to be a general answer. Further, we would need to exclude more motivations to account for epistemic reasons, e.g. agents in the ideal conditions will not have their beliefs influenced by their identity. As we plug in more and more constraints into the ideal conditions, this defeats one of the main attractions of internalism, which was that it can provide a simple unified relation to explain the normative reasons we have in a non-ad-hoc fashion. But this explanatory power is lost if the theory has to make endless assumptions about what reasons we have prior to “explaining” them. Constructivism So we should not account for the degenerate motivational features of an agent by explicitly excluding specific kinds of motivations from the idealized conditions. Instead, I believe there is a promising strategy for removing degenerate elements that provides a unified account of all normative reasons in a non-ad-hoc fashion. The strategy is to limit the motivational set to an agent’s normative judgments, i.e. the agent’s own personal judgments about the reasons they have. This allows us to accommodate the above examples of degenerate motivations. For example, an agent does not have reason to form beliefs on the basis of protecting their identity because the agent, by their own lights, probably judges that it is irrational to do so (typically, people will deny that their beliefs are based on protecting their identity. Even when a person’s beliefs are based on protecting their identity, they think their beliefs are based on the evidence). Similarly, an agent who hates their drug addiction does not have reason to inject heroin because the agent, by their own lights, does not endorse their drive to inject the heroin, i.e. the agent judges that they don’t have reason to inject the heroin. The motivation for limiting the motivational set to the agent’s normative judgments is based on the insight that not all motivations are rational motivations, i.e. motivations that an agent forms because of what they take themselves to have reason to do. It seems that non-rational motivations - e.g. physical addictions, psychological compulsions, beliefs based on non-evidential considerations, etc. - never actually provide agents with reasons. Note that in order for this theory to qualify as a form of internalism, normative judgments must be elements of one’s motivational set, which means that normative judgments must be inherently motivating. This is a thesis known as judgment internalism (see here and here for brief discussion), which I personally endorse. The idea that normative reasons bear a special relation to one’s normative judgments is the basis of a metaethical theory called constructivism. Sharon Street articulates in “Constructivism about Reasons” the central thesis of constructivism as follows: “the fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A’s other judgments about reasons.” Whether a judgment “withstands scrutiny” from other judgments is supposed to be a descriptive fact that can be determined without any normative assumptions. In brief, a judgment withstands scrutiny from other judgments held by an agent if the agent in question could hold all the judgments in full awareness. Note that this allows that agents can be incorrect about their reasons because agents often are not in full awareness of their judgments. Much more needs to be said about this and whether constructivism is a plausible theory. I hope to speak more about the merits of constructivism in a future post. I mention it here only to outline a possible strategy for a global internalist theory of reasons to account for degenerate motivations in a unified, non-ad-hoc fashion. Concluding thoughts Practical internalism already has an attraction over externalism in that it can describe a single relation in virtue of which all of our practical reasons are grounded. Externalism, on the other hand, needs to posit multiple independent properties or relations to ground our practical reasons. Further, the fact that internalism can potentially ground reasons in other normative domains (e.g. with regard to reasons for belief) provides very strong evidence in favor of internalism with regard to reasons for action. All else equal, a theory that can explain observations across a wide variety of contexts in a non-ad-hoc fashion has more plausibility than a theory that must posit many different independent explanations to account for those same observations. Thus, if everything I’ve said in this post is correct regarding the viability of epistemic internalism, externalists must show that all else is not equal. That is, an externalist must provide an explanation for why beliefs and actions are sufficiently different such that internalism is viable for the former attitudes but not the latter attitudes. As stated before, such an explanation seems implausible because the concept of a normative reason is the same when we speak of reasons for beliefs and reasons for action. In any event, until such an explanation is provided, it seems that the more plausible route is to adopt internalism as a theory of reasons for action.

They note (page 203) that full private ownership of an object consists of the following rights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(1) control rights over the use of the object; (2) rights to compensation if someone uses the object without one’s permission; (3) enforcement rights (to prevent the violation of these rights or to extract compensation owed for past violation); (4) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan); and (5) immunity to the nonconsensual loss of any of the rights of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarianism is attractive for its endorsement of policies that empower individuals to lead their own lives, free from the control of others. For example, libertarians often endorse private property, drug legalization, freedom of speech, etc. which enables individuals to lead their own lives without interference from others. But libertarianism is notorious for its rejection of regulations by the state that many see as morally permissible. For example, libertarians often reject forms of wealth redistribution, welfare states, social safety nets, etc. because (they believe) the state violates our ownership rights (either over our bodies or our extrapersonal property) insofar as we are forced to fund these services against our will. Many libertarians (anarchists) go further and claim that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; mandatory taxation is unjust. If this claim is correct, then it seems that libertarianism is committed to the rejection of the state, as most conceptions of the state involve mandatory taxation of its citizens. This post will argue that this conclusion is incorrect. I will argue that an adequate justification of the mandatory taxation by the state &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be provided on broadly libertarian grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start by considering a principle for delineating ownership rights that all libertarians (including anarchists) should accept. This principle has been described by Eric Mack as the “anti-paralysis” postulate. Then I argue that this postulate can be used to support a new class of rights to complement the five classes of rights mentioned above: exception rights. Exception rights permit disadvantaged individuals to intrude upon others in special circumstances that would ordinarily be rights violations. Because third-parties have the right to enforce the rights of others, I argue that the state is permitted to intrude upon others (via mandatory taxation) to enforce the exception rights of disadvantaged individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delineating-ownership-rights&quot;&gt;Delineating ownership rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarians are in agreement in their endorsement of ownership rights, both over one’s person and over private property. However, even if we grant that individuals have certain ownership rights, there is still an open question regarding how to &lt;em&gt;delineate&lt;/em&gt; ownership rights, i.e. how to determine the &lt;em&gt;particular rights&lt;/em&gt; that are granted by ownership. In this section, I will argue for what Eric Mack calls the “anti-paralysis” postulate, which is a principle that constrains how to delineate ownership rights. I will begin by considering some rights that almost all libertarians accept. Then I argue that the unifying rationale for these rights is to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. This implies that one should obey the “anti-paralysis” postulate when delineating ownership rights. Note that this section is a summary of some points that &lt;a href=&quot;http://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/delineating-libertarian-ownership-rights-the-anti-paralysis-postulate/&quot;&gt;I made in another post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rights-that-almost-all-libertarians-accept&quot;&gt;Rights that (almost) all libertarians accept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following features of rights that almost all libertarians accept:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claim-rights&lt;/em&gt;. No theory of ownership rights would be complete if it only granted &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights, i.e. moral &lt;em&gt;permissions&lt;/em&gt; to use or acquire certain resources. Any adequate theory of ownership rights must also grant &lt;em&gt;claim-_rights, i.e. moral _prohibitions&lt;/em&gt; against others using or acquiring certain resources. For example, an adequate theory of self-ownership must grant a person &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights that &lt;em&gt;permit&lt;/em&gt; him to use his body as he pleases (within limits) as well as &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights that &lt;em&gt;prohibit&lt;/em&gt; others from making use of his body (within limits).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unilateral property acquisition&lt;/em&gt;. According to universal joint-ownership conceptions of property rights, every individual owns an equal portion of every external resource. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch11&quot;&gt;Maloberti (p. 157)&lt;/a&gt; describes it as a system whereby “each individual would be assigned a claim right against every other, against the use and possessions of those resources. No individual would thus have the liberty to use or possess such resources without the approval of everybody else”. Almost all libertarians reject this. Instead, almost all libertarians “accept that individuals can acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without having to ask the consent of approval of other people, some governing body, or anything else” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/#PowerApp&quot;&gt;section 3&lt;/a&gt; of the SEP on Libertarianism).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockean Proviso&lt;/em&gt;. Most libertarians accept that permissible property acquisition, while unilateral, must be subject to the &lt;em&gt;Lockean Proviso&lt;/em&gt;. This means that the acquisition must leave “enough, and as good” for others. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=sites&amp;amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwcm9mZXNzb3JlcmljbWFja3xneDo5NDMzMGE1ODkxOTJiOWY&quot;&gt;Eric Mack (p. 214)&lt;/a&gt; notes, the Lockean Proviso “requires that the acquisition and disposition of property rights not on net make the extra-personal world less susceptible to any individual’s efforts to exercise his powers in ways that serve his ends.” While libertarians disagree on how to interpret the Lockean Privoso, only the most extreme &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;-leaning conceptions of property rights reject &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of the Lockean Proviso.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enforcement rights&lt;/em&gt;. Enforcement rights involve rights to retaliatory threats and self-defense to prevent future rights violations, and potentially the right to seek restitution and perhaps punishment for past rights violations. Every non-pacifist libertarian accepts some form of enforcement right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minor Intrusions&lt;/em&gt;. Most libertarians do not consider extremely minor intrusions of someone’s property to be a rights violation. For example, whenever I burn leaves in my backyard, I cause smoke particles to fall in your yard. Whenever I use a telephone or a radio, I cause electromagnetic waves to be sent through your body and your property. Whenever I produce sound, I send sound waves through your home which impacts your eardrums. Whenever I breathe, I emit carbon dioxide which pollutes your airspace, and hence your property and your lungs. However, while these acts might intrude upon your property, they do not constitute &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt; violations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unifying rationale for these rights is a concern to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. Consider the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claim-rights are necessary because the alternative is “moral anarchy”. Everyone would be morally permitted to achieve whatever goal they might have without concern for the rights of others. This ironically results in everyone being unable to lead their own lives; anyone’s pursuit of a goal could be interrupted by someone else exercising their liberty-right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unilateral property acquisition is necessary because the alternative (universal joint-ownership conceptions of property rights) permits circumstances where individuals have effectively no liberty to acquire the resources necessary to lead their own lives. We would be at the mercy of the approval of everyone else whenever we wanted to acquire or use any external resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Lockean Proviso is necessary because the alternative (unrestricted property acquisition) permits circumstances where a privileged group of individuals owns &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being unable to lead their lives; everyone else would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire or use any external resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enforcement rights are necessary because the alternative permits circumstances where innocents are not permitted to protect themselves from unjust attacks by others. The result is that individuals are ultimately unable to lead their lives; individuals would be completely at the mercy of those who would damage them or their property.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The permission of minor intrusions is necessary because the alternative creates circumstances where individuals don’t have the moral permissions to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; (since all actions cause some &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; intrusion on the property of others). This ultimately results in individuals being unable to effectively lead their own lives; we would be at the mercy of everyone else who we might impose minor intrusions on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-multiple-dimensions-of-rights&quot;&gt;The multiple dimensions of rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations provide some insight into the nature of ownership. It might be assumed that self-ownership is a single concept with a precise, determinate content. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/OTSUKAM/leftlibP&amp;amp;PA.pdf&quot;&gt;Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204)&lt;/a&gt; define “full self-ownership” as “a bundle of rights that is (roughly) equal to the logically strongest set of ownership rights that people can have over themselves compatible with others having equal such rights over themselves”. However, there is no &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; “logically strongest” set of rights. Indeed, the authors later note that “full self-ownership involves some undeniable indeterminacy” because “there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights” (p. 205). For example, if you have two bundles of rights X and Y, then X might be stronger than Y along one dimension (e.g. in terms of liberty-rights), but Y might be stronger than X along another dimension (e.g. in terms of claim-rights). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch14&quot;&gt;Jason Brennan and Bas van der Vossen (2017, p. 209)&lt;/a&gt; articulated the multifaceted nature of self-ownership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protection (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know what is the best mix of moral protections (claim-rights) and moral freedoms (liberty-rights). In fact, I am not even sure if there could be a satisfactory answer. However, I am confident that the proper mix does not involve the &lt;em&gt;exclusion&lt;/em&gt; of either variable. Maximizing liberty-rights at the exclusion of claim-rights leads to “moral anarchy”, as everyone would be morally permitted to do whatever they please. Maximizing claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights leads to “moral paralysis”, as everyone would be prohibited from imposing even minor intrusions on others. Both are unacceptable as they leave us without the ability to lead our own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. This insight suggests adopting the “anti-paralysis” postulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anti-paralysis-postulate&quot;&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate by Eric Mack (he now refers to it as the “Elbow Room postulate” but I prefer the older naming) is a principle that constrains the strength of the claim-rights that are granted to people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=sites&amp;amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwcm9mZXNzb3JlcmljbWFja3xneDo5NDMzMGE1ODkxOTJiOWY&quot;&gt;Mack (p. 197)&lt;/a&gt; details the postulate as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to this postulate, a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect…the elbow room postulate tells us that, since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, a reasonable delineation of rights does not construe minor intrusions as boundary-crossings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is to not grant excessive claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights as doing so would result in “moral paralysis” (or what he calls “hog-tying”). The very &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of ascribing claim-rights was to protect the effective exercise of liberty-rights (to avoid “moral anarchy”). Therefore, it makes sense that we do not ascribe claim-rights so strongly that our liberty-rights are effectively nullified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have interpreted Mack’s postulate as treating claim-rights as a type of force that a moral theory must protect individuals from, just as moral theories must protect individuals from coercion from other individuals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://philarchive.org/rec/SOBQPO&quot;&gt;David Sobel (2018)&lt;/a&gt; gave the following interpretation of the postulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mack seems to be saying that the point of rights is to provide protection not only from other people forcibly preventing me from living my life by my lights, but also from a system of rights that would morally prohibit me from doing so…Mack can therefore be interpreted as saying that the point of rights is to enhance our ability to live our own lives by our own lights, unprevented by others or by the moral force of other people’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, just as we should not grant individuals excessive &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights since that would make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral anarchy”), we also should not grant individuals excessive &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights since that would also make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral paralysis”). The anti-paralysis postulate can ground many of the specifications of rights mentioned earlier. For example, universal joint-ownership of property rights should be rejected because this results in “moral paralysis” since we wouldn’t be able to make use of resources without the approval of the collective. Also, without the Lockean Proviso, one individual could come to own all external resources, resulting in “moral paralysis” for everyone else. And if minor intrusions were to count as rights violations, then that would result in “moral paralysis” for everyone, since every minor action would be a rights violation. In all cases, the motivation is to avoid granting individuals excessive claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights. The anti-paralysis postulate is the organizing principle operating behind the rights that almost all libertarians accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;justifying-the-state&quot;&gt;Justifying the state&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exception-rights&quot;&gt;Exception Rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate tells us that rights should not be delineated such that the claim-rights systemically preclude individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that they were meant to protect. Specifically, we say that rights should be delineated such that the following acts do not count as rights violations: the unilateral acquisition of property subject to the Lockean Proviso, the enforcement of one’s rights, and the imposition of minor intrusions on others. However, this does not go far enough. Even when these specific acts are permitted, there will still be some disadvantaged individuals who are “morally paralyzed” - individuals who, through no fault of their own, do not have the opportunity to acquire the resources necessary to make use of their liberty-rights without violating anyone else’s rights. For example, consider children without adequate caretakers, or adults who never developed the skills necessary to provide for themselves (either because of lack of opportunity or lack of ability). These individuals may be unable to acquire the resources necessary to fund the protection of the rights that all libertarians agree they have. For example, they wouldn’t be able to legitimately hire defense agencies to protect themselves from assault, to protect their property from theft, to enforce contracts with others, etc. In other words, they would be unable to effectively lead their lives independent of the will of others. Just as people would be morally paralyzed under a joint-ownership theory of property rights or under a system of rights where minor intrusions are prohibited, these disadvantaged individuals would be likewise morally paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the anti-paralysis postulate, rights must be delineated so that this does not occur. Rights should be delineated such that sufficiently disadvantaged individuals are permitted to make minor intrusions on the possessions of others if doing so is necessary to escape peril. This is where exception rights come in. Exception rights attenuate our claim-rights. They allow for there to be &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt; circumstances where disadvantaged individuals are morally permitted to control someone else’s resources in a way that would ordinarily be impermissible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch11&quot;&gt;Nicolás Maloberti (p. 161)&lt;/a&gt; outlines exception rights as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus, while individuals’ basic rights are necessary for the protection of individuals’ capacity to lead their own lives, in certain situations, those rights themselves might restrict that very same capacity in other individuals without providing a significant benefit to anybody else. Exception rights block this possibility. Exception rights might then be understood as imposing constraints on the exercise of the most basic libertarian rights. With our own axe, we might do as we wish, as long as the use of our axe is not necessary for someone to save a stranger from a burning car, and as long we do not have to use it for something relatively important at the time. By implying this form of restriction, exception rights provide their potential holders a form of moral insurance against the faultless loss of the fundamental value that the most basic rights provide: a sphere of sovereignty that obviates the need to secure the approval of others to pursue our own ends and projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for exception rights is exactly the same as the motivation to adopt the anti-paralysis postulate: we should not grant to individuals excessive claim-rights that would make the liberty-rights of others meaningless (i.e. avoid “moral paralysis”). If the anti-paralysis postulate should be adopted, then so should exception rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more specific example of when exception rights apply, consider the following scenario. Imagine that you find a child drowning in a swimming pool in your neighbor’s backyard. The child is drowning in the swimming pool through no fault of the neighbor (imagine that the child jumped on a trampoline from another neighbor’s yard and a gust of wind with unprecedented power blew him into the pool). You need to reach the child to save him but the only option to reach the child requires slightly damaging the neighbor’s fence. You know that the owner of the yard does not consent to you damaging his property to save the child; in fact, he has a sign on the fence that reads “do not slightly damage this fence in order to save drowning children.” Also, imagine further that you know you will be unable to compensate the owner for damaging his fence. Are you morally permitted to damage the fence to save the child? The clear answer is that you are. More importantly, is the owner of the property morally permitted to stop you from damaging his fence to save the child? Again, the clear answer here is that the owner is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; permitted to stop you. But he clearly &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; his fence and his yard, so how can it be that he is not permitted to stop you from damaging his property without compensation? The answer, of course, is that the child has an exception right which you are permitted to enforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, allow me to detail the particular circumstances when I think exception rights apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conditions-when-exception-rights-apply&quot;&gt;Conditions when exception rights apply&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Nicolás Maloberti (p. 162), there are four key conditions to take into account when determining whether X has an exception-right to intrude upon Y in a way that would ordinarily be a violation of Y’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The gravity of the peril faced by X. Exception rights apply only to situations where the peril faced by X is of a significant enough gravity. This includes, for example, circumstances where one’s basic ownership rights are violated by a criminal - e.g. assault, property damage, theft, fraud, contract breach, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fact that such a perilous situation is not the fault of the X. Exception rights apply only in situations where the peril faced by X was not the result of X having neglected a reasonable opportunity to avoid such peril. If X had a reasonable opportunity in the past to avoid peril but failed to exercise this opportunity, then X does not have an exception right to intrude upon others to escape such peril.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The necessary character of the corresponding infringement to overcome the peril. The intrusion on Y must be &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; (or close to necessary) in order for the exception right to apply. E.g. if X can be lifted out of dire circumstances by, say, working hard, then X does not have an exception right to intrude upon Y. X must lack an alternative method to escape dire conditions in order to permit intruding upon Y. This condition also tells us that X’s exception right only permits him to impose the &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; amount of intrusion necessary to bring himself out of perilous circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cost of the intrusion imposed on Y. The burden imposed on Y by the intrusion cannot be too great. For example, X cannot amputate Y’s limb in order to save his life. The cost imposed on Y must be reasonable. To determine whether or not a burden is “reasonable”, I believe we can consider our intuitions regarding enforcement rights. For example, if X needs to break Y’s fence in order to save a child from drowning, I think most would agree that Y is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; permitted to stop X from breaking the fence. On the other hand, if X needs to steal one of Y’s kidneys to survive, I think most would agree that Y &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; permitted to stop X (even if Y does not need both kidneys to be healthy). The difference between these two scenarios is that breaking a fence is a reasonable cost whereas stealing a kidney is not. So the distinction between reasonable and unreasonable intrusions is already relevant when determining whether a right is enforceable. This same distinction can also be used to determine whether a disadvantaged person has an exception right to intrude upon someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the conditions imply that compensation is not strictly necessary in all cases. If the conditions above are met, then one is permitted to intrude upon others even if they cannot compensate the intruded person. However, compensation is relevant in at least two respects: (1) even if X is permitted to intrude on Y, X will be morally obligated to compensate Y to the extent that this is possible without X falling back into perilous circumstances (in order to minimize the amount of intrusion placed on Y, from condition 3), and (2) compensation might be necessary to permit intrusions if it is necessary to reduce the cost imposed on Y to a reasonable level. For example, it might not be morally permissible to steal $1000 from someone because the $1000 cost is too large, but it might be permissible to steal $1000 and compensate them $900 because the $100 cost is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-state&quot;&gt;The State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have argued that the anti-paralysis postulate grants disadvantaged individuals exception rights to intrude upon others in special perilous circumstances. To justify the state, I need only make the plausible assumption that third-parties are morally permitted to enforce the rights of others on their behalf (e.g. I am morally permitted to defend a woman being assaulted by attacking her assailant). If that is true, then the state can act as a third-party to enforce the exception rights of disadvantaged individuals. Since exception rights permit one to intrude upon others in ways that would ordinarily be rights violations, states are morally permitted to intrude upon others (e.g. via mandatory taxation) in ways that would ordinarily be rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only remaining question is whether mandatory taxation by the state can satisfy the conditions required for exception rights. Note that the question is not whether any &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; states operate in a manner that meets these conditions. The question is whether a state that imposes mandatory taxation &lt;em&gt;can be&lt;/em&gt; morally permissible, i.e. the question is whether mandatory taxation is &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt; impermissible. Now, it seems to me that mandatory taxation can be justified by the state because the conditions required for exception rights are adequately met (against some anarchist libertarians who think the state is in principle impermissible):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are disadvantaged individuals who would face a sufficiently large gravity of peril if there were no mandatory taxation by the state. This includes individuals who would lack the reasonable opportunity to protect their rights (e.g. rights to property and self-ownership) without mandatory taxation by the state. This includes individuals who would be unable to afford to protect themselves from assault, to protect their property from theft, or to enforce contracts with others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are disadvantaged individuals who would find themselves in these perilous circumstances through no fault of their own. Some people find themselves born into disadvantaged environments where they lack the reasonable opportunity to avoid such perils. Others are placed into such disadvantaged environments in their lifetime due to unforeseeable accidents or crimes by others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are disadvantaged individuals who are unable to bring themselves out of these perilous circumstances without intruding upon others (either because of lack of opportunity or lack of ability).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The state can impose reasonable intrusions on others to alleviate these perilous circumstances by imposing a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; mandatory tax rate on others. A progressive tax rate probably makes the most sense, since a certain tax rate can be reasonable for a rich person but that same tax rate might be unreasonable for a poor person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conditions imply that the state should be fairly limited (at least if it is to be justified on the basis of exception rights). Taxation should not be too high and the state’s activities should be restricted to ensuring that people have a reasonable opportunity to protect their rights because the state cannot impose unreasonable burdens on taxpayers. This suggests that the state is at least permitted to perform all of the services performed by what &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nozick-political/&quot;&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;/a&gt; calls the “minimal state”: police protection, contract enforcement, courts, and military. The state &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; also be permitted to perform some activities beyond that of the minimal state because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Perilous circumstances” may encompass more than just lacking the reasonable opportunity to &lt;em&gt;protect&lt;/em&gt; one’s rights; it may also encompass lacking the reasonable opportunity to &lt;em&gt;make use&lt;/em&gt; of one’s rights. If so, “perilous circumstances” would include lacking the &lt;em&gt;capacity&lt;/em&gt; to make use of one’s rights, which permits the state to subsidize access to additional goods/services (e.g. food, education, etc.) which are necessary for one to develop this capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it can be shown that the state sufficiently compensates taxpayers, then this may be sufficient to justify more extensive taxation to fund additional services. It is conceivable that the state compensates taxpayers by providing police protection of private property, enforcement of contracts, development of the economy, etc. To the extent that &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; state activities sufficiently compensates taxpayers, it may be morally permissible for states to fund those activities via mandatory taxation, since the cost placed on taxpayers would be sufficiently low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This were just some cursory ideas. Whether the state is permitted to perform these additional activities of course depends on more argumentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to conclude my argument with a few qualifications. Firstly, the conditions that I mentioned above should not be taken as necessary conditions for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; coercive state activity. Rather, they are necessary conditions to justify state activity &lt;em&gt;based on exception rights.&lt;/em&gt; My argument is agnostic with respect to whether there are other libertarian-compatible justifications of other forms of coercive state activity. Secondly, my argument is agnostic with respect to whether the state must or should have a monopoly on force, something that is often assumed to be a key feature of states. The argument says nothing about whether there can be multiple states within a given region. In principle, multiple states overlapping within a given region can be justified via exception rights so long as they adhere to the conditions that I mentioned above. In practice, however, the problems entailed from multiple overlapping states are likely serious enough that states must (or at least should) have a monopoly on force within a given region.&lt;/p&gt;

The argument is based on the minor damages and risk associated with minor pollution forbids us from actions that we ordinarily think we have the right to do.

The state is justified on the basis of “samaritanism” duties that we owe to those in need - our duties to assist those who are in serious peril when the assistance comes at little cost.

In it, Mack argues for what he calls the “elbow room postulate” (which I referred to as the “anti-paralysis postulate in this post) in order to permit the minor intrusions mentioned by Sobel and Railton.

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Libertarianism is strongly committed to self-ownership. Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, page 204) note that private ownership over an object involves “a bundle of particular rights” with respect to that object. They note (page 203) that full private ownership of an object consists of the following rights: (1) control rights over the use of the object; (2) rights to compensation if someone uses the object without one’s permission; (3) enforcement rights (to prevent the violation of these rights or to extract compensation owed for past violation); (4) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan); and (5) immunity to the nonconsensual loss of any of the rights of ownership. Libertarianism is attractive for its endorsement of policies that empower individuals to lead their own lives, free from the control of others. For example, libertarians often endorse private property, drug legalization, freedom of speech, etc. which enables individuals to lead their own lives without interference from others. But libertarianism is notorious for its rejection of regulations by the state that many see as morally permissible. For example, libertarians often reject forms of wealth redistribution, welfare states, social safety nets, etc. because (they believe) the state violates our ownership rights (either over our bodies or our extrapersonal property) insofar as we are forced to fund these services against our will. Many libertarians (anarchists) go further and claim that all mandatory taxation is unjust. If this claim is correct, then it seems that libertarianism is committed to the rejection of the state, as most conceptions of the state involve mandatory taxation of its citizens. This post will argue that this conclusion is incorrect. I will argue that an adequate justification of the mandatory taxation by the state can be provided on broadly libertarian grounds. I start by considering a principle for delineating ownership rights that all libertarians (including anarchists) should accept. This principle has been described by Eric Mack as the “anti-paralysis” postulate. Then I argue that this postulate can be used to support a new class of rights to complement the five classes of rights mentioned above: exception rights. Exception rights permit disadvantaged individuals to intrude upon others in special circumstances that would ordinarily be rights violations. Because third-parties have the right to enforce the rights of others, I argue that the state is permitted to intrude upon others (via mandatory taxation) to enforce the exception rights of disadvantaged individuals. Delineating ownership rights Libertarians are in agreement in their endorsement of ownership rights, both over one’s person and over private property. However, even if we grant that individuals have certain ownership rights, there is still an open question regarding how to delineate ownership rights, i.e. how to determine the particular rights that are granted by ownership. In this section, I will argue for what Eric Mack calls the “anti-paralysis” postulate, which is a principle that constrains how to delineate ownership rights. I will begin by considering some rights that almost all libertarians accept. Then I argue that the unifying rationale for these rights is to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. This implies that one should obey the “anti-paralysis” postulate when delineating ownership rights. Note that this section is a summary of some points that I made in another post. Rights that (almost) all libertarians accept Consider the following features of rights that almost all libertarians accept: Claim-rights. No theory of ownership rights would be complete if it only granted liberty-rights, i.e. moral permissions to use or acquire certain resources. Any adequate theory of ownership rights must also grant claim-_rights, i.e. moral _prohibitions against others using or acquiring certain resources. For example, an adequate theory of self-ownership must grant a person liberty-rights that permit him to use his body as he pleases (within limits) as well as claim-rights that prohibit others from making use of his body (within limits). Unilateral property acquisition. According to universal joint-ownership conceptions of property rights, every individual owns an equal portion of every external resource. Maloberti (p. 157) describes it as a system whereby “each individual would be assigned a claim right against every other, against the use and possessions of those resources. No individual would thus have the liberty to use or possess such resources without the approval of everybody else”. Almost all libertarians reject this. Instead, almost all libertarians “accept that individuals can acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without having to ask the consent of approval of other people, some governing body, or anything else” (section 3 of the SEP on Libertarianism). Lockean Proviso. Most libertarians accept that permissible property acquisition, while unilateral, must be subject to the Lockean Proviso. This means that the acquisition must leave “enough, and as good” for others. As Eric Mack (p. 214) notes, the Lockean Proviso “requires that the acquisition and disposition of property rights not on net make the extra-personal world less susceptible to any individual’s efforts to exercise his powers in ways that serve his ends.” While libertarians disagree on how to interpret the Lockean Privoso, only the most extreme right-leaning conceptions of property rights reject all forms of the Lockean Proviso. Enforcement rights. Enforcement rights involve rights to retaliatory threats and self-defense to prevent future rights violations, and potentially the right to seek restitution and perhaps punishment for past rights violations. Every non-pacifist libertarian accepts some form of enforcement right. Minor Intrusions. Most libertarians do not consider extremely minor intrusions of someone’s property to be a rights violation. For example, whenever I burn leaves in my backyard, I cause smoke particles to fall in your yard. Whenever I use a telephone or a radio, I cause electromagnetic waves to be sent through your body and your property. Whenever I produce sound, I send sound waves through your home which impacts your eardrums. Whenever I breathe, I emit carbon dioxide which pollutes your airspace, and hence your property and your lungs. However, while these acts might intrude upon your property, they do not constitute rights violations. The unifying rationale for these rights is a concern to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. Consider the following. Claim-rights are necessary because the alternative is “moral anarchy”. Everyone would be morally permitted to achieve whatever goal they might have without concern for the rights of others. This ironically results in everyone being unable to lead their own lives; anyone’s pursuit of a goal could be interrupted by someone else exercising their liberty-right. Unilateral property acquisition is necessary because the alternative (universal joint-ownership conceptions of property rights) permits circumstances where individuals have effectively no liberty to acquire the resources necessary to lead their own lives. We would be at the mercy of the approval of everyone else whenever we wanted to acquire or use any external resources. The Lockean Proviso is necessary because the alternative (unrestricted property acquisition) permits circumstances where a privileged group of individuals owns all valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being unable to lead their lives; everyone else would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire or use any external resources. Enforcement rights are necessary because the alternative permits circumstances where innocents are not permitted to protect themselves from unjust attacks by others. The result is that individuals are ultimately unable to lead their lives; individuals would be completely at the mercy of those who would damage them or their property. The permission of minor intrusions is necessary because the alternative creates circumstances where individuals don’t have the moral permissions to do anything (since all actions cause some minor intrusion on the property of others). This ultimately results in individuals being unable to effectively lead their own lives; we would be at the mercy of everyone else who we might impose minor intrusions on. The multiple dimensions of rights These considerations provide some insight into the nature of ownership. It might be assumed that self-ownership is a single concept with a precise, determinate content. For example, Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204) define “full self-ownership” as “a bundle of rights that is (roughly) equal to the logically strongest set of ownership rights that people can have over themselves compatible with others having equal such rights over themselves”. However, there is no single “logically strongest” set of rights. Indeed, the authors later note that “full self-ownership involves some undeniable indeterminacy” because “there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights” (p. 205). For example, if you have two bundles of rights X and Y, then X might be stronger than Y along one dimension (e.g. in terms of liberty-rights), but Y might be stronger than X along another dimension (e.g. in terms of claim-rights). Jason Brennan and Bas van der Vossen (2017, p. 209) articulated the multifaceted nature of self-ownership: More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protection (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other. The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable. I do not know what is the best mix of moral protections (claim-rights) and moral freedoms (liberty-rights). In fact, I am not even sure if there could be a satisfactory answer. However, I am confident that the proper mix does not involve the exclusion of either variable. Maximizing liberty-rights at the exclusion of claim-rights leads to “moral anarchy”, as everyone would be morally permitted to do whatever they please. Maximizing claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights leads to “moral paralysis”, as everyone would be prohibited from imposing even minor intrusions on others. Both are unacceptable as they leave us without the ability to lead our own lives without being subject to the mercy of others. This insight suggests adopting the “anti-paralysis” postulate. The anti-paralysis postulate The anti-paralysis postulate by Eric Mack (he now refers to it as the “Elbow Room postulate” but I prefer the older naming) is a principle that constrains the strength of the claim-rights that are granted to people. Mack (p. 197) details the postulate as follows: According to this postulate, a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect…the elbow room postulate tells us that, since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, a reasonable delineation of rights does not construe minor intrusions as boundary-crossings. The idea here is to not grant excessive claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights as doing so would result in “moral paralysis” (or what he calls “hog-tying”). The very purpose of ascribing claim-rights was to protect the effective exercise of liberty-rights (to avoid “moral anarchy”). Therefore, it makes sense that we do not ascribe claim-rights so strongly that our liberty-rights are effectively nullified. Some have interpreted Mack’s postulate as treating claim-rights as a type of force that a moral theory must protect individuals from, just as moral theories must protect individuals from coercion from other individuals. David Sobel (2018) gave the following interpretation of the postulate: Mack seems to be saying that the point of rights is to provide protection not only from other people forcibly preventing me from living my life by my lights, but also from a system of rights that would morally prohibit me from doing so…Mack can therefore be interpreted as saying that the point of rights is to enhance our ability to live our own lives by our own lights, unprevented by others or by the moral force of other people’s rights. In other words, just as we should not grant individuals excessive liberty-rights since that would make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral anarchy”), we also should not grant individuals excessive claim-rights since that would also make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral paralysis”). The anti-paralysis postulate can ground many of the specifications of rights mentioned earlier. For example, universal joint-ownership of property rights should be rejected because this results in “moral paralysis” since we wouldn’t be able to make use of resources without the approval of the collective. Also, without the Lockean Proviso, one individual could come to own all external resources, resulting in “moral paralysis” for everyone else. And if minor intrusions were to count as rights violations, then that would result in “moral paralysis” for everyone, since every minor action would be a rights violation. In all cases, the motivation is to avoid granting individuals excessive claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights. The anti-paralysis postulate is the organizing principle operating behind the rights that almost all libertarians accept. Justifying the state Exception Rights The anti-paralysis postulate tells us that rights should not be delineated such that the claim-rights systemically preclude individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that they were meant to protect. Specifically, we say that rights should be delineated such that the following acts do not count as rights violations: the unilateral acquisition of property subject to the Lockean Proviso, the enforcement of one’s rights, and the imposition of minor intrusions on others. However, this does not go far enough. Even when these specific acts are permitted, there will still be some disadvantaged individuals who are “morally paralyzed” - individuals who, through no fault of their own, do not have the opportunity to acquire the resources necessary to make use of their liberty-rights without violating anyone else’s rights. For example, consider children without adequate caretakers, or adults who never developed the skills necessary to provide for themselves (either because of lack of opportunity or lack of ability). These individuals may be unable to acquire the resources necessary to fund the protection of the rights that all libertarians agree they have. For example, they wouldn’t be able to legitimately hire defense agencies to protect themselves from assault, to protect their property from theft, to enforce contracts with others, etc. In other words, they would be unable to effectively lead their lives independent of the will of others. Just as people would be morally paralyzed under a joint-ownership theory of property rights or under a system of rights where minor intrusions are prohibited, these disadvantaged individuals would be likewise morally paralyzed. According to the anti-paralysis postulate, rights must be delineated so that this does not occur. Rights should be delineated such that sufficiently disadvantaged individuals are permitted to make minor intrusions on the possessions of others if doing so is necessary to escape peril. This is where exception rights come in. Exception rights attenuate our claim-rights. They allow for there to be special circumstances where disadvantaged individuals are morally permitted to control someone else’s resources in a way that would ordinarily be impermissible. Nicolás Maloberti (p. 161) outlines exception rights as follows: Thus, while individuals’ basic rights are necessary for the protection of individuals’ capacity to lead their own lives, in certain situations, those rights themselves might restrict that very same capacity in other individuals without providing a significant benefit to anybody else. Exception rights block this possibility. Exception rights might then be understood as imposing constraints on the exercise of the most basic libertarian rights. With our own axe, we might do as we wish, as long as the use of our axe is not necessary for someone to save a stranger from a burning car, and as long we do not have to use it for something relatively important at the time. By implying this form of restriction, exception rights provide their potential holders a form of moral insurance against the faultless loss of the fundamental value that the most basic rights provide: a sphere of sovereignty that obviates the need to secure the approval of others to pursue our own ends and projects. The motivation for exception rights is exactly the same as the motivation to adopt the anti-paralysis postulate: we should not grant to individuals excessive claim-rights that would make the liberty-rights of others meaningless (i.e. avoid “moral paralysis”). If the anti-paralysis postulate should be adopted, then so should exception rights. For a more specific example of when exception rights apply, consider the following scenario. Imagine that you find a child drowning in a swimming pool in your neighbor’s backyard. The child is drowning in the swimming pool through no fault of the neighbor (imagine that the child jumped on a trampoline from another neighbor’s yard and a gust of wind with unprecedented power blew him into the pool). You need to reach the child to save him but the only option to reach the child requires slightly damaging the neighbor’s fence. You know that the owner of the yard does not consent to you damaging his property to save the child; in fact, he has a sign on the fence that reads “do not slightly damage this fence in order to save drowning children.” Also, imagine further that you know you will be unable to compensate the owner for damaging his fence. Are you morally permitted to damage the fence to save the child? The clear answer is that you are. More importantly, is the owner of the property morally permitted to stop you from damaging his fence to save the child? Again, the clear answer here is that the owner is not permitted to stop you. But he clearly owns his fence and his yard, so how can it be that he is not permitted to stop you from damaging his property without compensation? The answer, of course, is that the child has an exception right which you are permitted to enforce. Now, allow me to detail the particular circumstances when I think exception rights apply. Conditions when exception rights apply Following Nicolás Maloberti (p. 162), there are four key conditions to take into account when determining whether X has an exception-right to intrude upon Y in a way that would ordinarily be a violation of Y’s rights. The gravity of the peril faced by X. Exception rights apply only to situations where the peril faced by X is of a significant enough gravity. This includes, for example, circumstances where one’s basic ownership rights are violated by a criminal - e.g. assault, property damage, theft, fraud, contract breach, etc. The fact that such a perilous situation is not the fault of the X. Exception rights apply only in situations where the peril faced by X was not the result of X having neglected a reasonable opportunity to avoid such peril. If X had a reasonable opportunity in the past to avoid peril but failed to exercise this opportunity, then X does not have an exception right to intrude upon others to escape such peril. The necessary character of the corresponding infringement to overcome the peril. The intrusion on Y must be necessary (or close to necessary) in order for the exception right to apply. E.g. if X can be lifted out of dire circumstances by, say, working hard, then X does not have an exception right to intrude upon Y. X must lack an alternative method to escape dire conditions in order to permit intruding upon Y. This condition also tells us that X’s exception right only permits him to impose the minimum amount of intrusion necessary to bring himself out of perilous circumstances. The cost of the intrusion imposed on Y. The burden imposed on Y by the intrusion cannot be too great. For example, X cannot amputate Y’s limb in order to save his life. The cost imposed on Y must be reasonable. To determine whether or not a burden is “reasonable”, I believe we can consider our intuitions regarding enforcement rights. For example, if X needs to break Y’s fence in order to save a child from drowning, I think most would agree that Y is not permitted to stop X from breaking the fence. On the other hand, if X needs to steal one of Y’s kidneys to survive, I think most would agree that Y is permitted to stop X (even if Y does not need both kidneys to be healthy). The difference between these two scenarios is that breaking a fence is a reasonable cost whereas stealing a kidney is not. So the distinction between reasonable and unreasonable intrusions is already relevant when determining whether a right is enforceable. This same distinction can also be used to determine whether a disadvantaged person has an exception right to intrude upon someone. Notice that the conditions imply that compensation is not strictly necessary in all cases. If the conditions above are met, then one is permitted to intrude upon others even if they cannot compensate the intruded person. However, compensation is relevant in at least two respects: (1) even if X is permitted to intrude on Y, X will be morally obligated to compensate Y to the extent that this is possible without X falling back into perilous circumstances (in order to minimize the amount of intrusion placed on Y, from condition 3), and (2) compensation might be necessary to permit intrusions if it is necessary to reduce the cost imposed on Y to a reasonable level. For example, it might not be morally permissible to steal $1000 from someone because the $1000 cost is too large, but it might be permissible to steal $1000 and compensate them $900 because the $100 cost is reasonable. The State So far, I have argued that the anti-paralysis postulate grants disadvantaged individuals exception rights to intrude upon others in special perilous circumstances. To justify the state, I need only make the plausible assumption that third-parties are morally permitted to enforce the rights of others on their behalf (e.g. I am morally permitted to defend a woman being assaulted by attacking her assailant). If that is true, then the state can act as a third-party to enforce the exception rights of disadvantaged individuals. Since exception rights permit one to intrude upon others in ways that would ordinarily be rights violations, states are morally permitted to intrude upon others (e.g. via mandatory taxation) in ways that would ordinarily be rights violations. The only remaining question is whether mandatory taxation by the state can satisfy the conditions required for exception rights. Note that the question is not whether any actual states operate in a manner that meets these conditions. The question is whether a state that imposes mandatory taxation can be morally permissible, i.e. the question is whether mandatory taxation is in principle impermissible. Now, it seems to me that mandatory taxation can be justified by the state because the conditions required for exception rights are adequately met (against some anarchist libertarians who think the state is in principle impermissible): There are disadvantaged individuals who would face a sufficiently large gravity of peril if there were no mandatory taxation by the state. This includes individuals who would lack the reasonable opportunity to protect their rights (e.g. rights to property and self-ownership) without mandatory taxation by the state. This includes individuals who would be unable to afford to protect themselves from assault, to protect their property from theft, or to enforce contracts with others. There are disadvantaged individuals who would find themselves in these perilous circumstances through no fault of their own. Some people find themselves born into disadvantaged environments where they lack the reasonable opportunity to avoid such perils. Others are placed into such disadvantaged environments in their lifetime due to unforeseeable accidents or crimes by others. There are disadvantaged individuals who are unable to bring themselves out of these perilous circumstances without intruding upon others (either because of lack of opportunity or lack of ability). The state can impose reasonable intrusions on others to alleviate these perilous circumstances by imposing a reasonable mandatory tax rate on others. A progressive tax rate probably makes the most sense, since a certain tax rate can be reasonable for a rich person but that same tax rate might be unreasonable for a poor person. These conditions imply that the state should be fairly limited (at least if it is to be justified on the basis of exception rights). Taxation should not be too high and the state’s activities should be restricted to ensuring that people have a reasonable opportunity to protect their rights because the state cannot impose unreasonable burdens on taxpayers. This suggests that the state is at least permitted to perform all of the services performed by what Robert Nozick calls the “minimal state”: police protection, contract enforcement, courts, and military. The state may also be permitted to perform some activities beyond that of the minimal state because: “Perilous circumstances” may encompass more than just lacking the reasonable opportunity to protect one’s rights; it may also encompass lacking the reasonable opportunity to make use of one’s rights. If so, “perilous circumstances” would include lacking the capacity to make use of one’s rights, which permits the state to subsidize access to additional goods/services (e.g. food, education, etc.) which are necessary for one to develop this capacity. If it can be shown that the state sufficiently compensates taxpayers, then this may be sufficient to justify more extensive taxation to fund additional services. It is conceivable that the state compensates taxpayers by providing police protection of private property, enforcement of contracts, development of the economy, etc. To the extent that additional state activities sufficiently compensates taxpayers, it may be morally permissible for states to fund those activities via mandatory taxation, since the cost placed on taxpayers would be sufficiently low. This were just some cursory ideas. Whether the state is permitted to perform these additional activities of course depends on more argumentation. I’d like to conclude my argument with a few qualifications. Firstly, the conditions that I mentioned above should not be taken as necessary conditions for any coercive state activity. Rather, they are necessary conditions to justify state activity based on exception rights. My argument is agnostic with respect to whether there are other libertarian-compatible justifications of other forms of coercive state activity. Secondly, my argument is agnostic with respect to whether the state must or should have a monopoly on force, something that is often assumed to be a key feature of states. The argument says nothing about whether there can be multiple states within a given region. In principle, multiple states overlapping within a given region can be justified via exception rights so long as they adhere to the conditions that I mentioned above. In practice, however, the problems entailed from multiple overlapping states are likely serious enough that states must (or at least should) have a monopoly on force within a given region. Relevant Papers The primary papers that have influenced my position: Peter Railton, “Locke, Stock, and Peril: Natural Property Rights, Pollution, and Risk” (1985) - Argues that, contrary to popular belief, libertarianism places stringent limits on what we are able to with our property. The argument is based on the minor damages and risk associated with minor pollution forbids us from actions that we ordinarily think we have the right to do. [archive] Christopher Wellman, “Toward a Liberal Theory of Political Obligation (2001) - Provides a libertarian/liberal justification of the state that is similar to the justification given here. The state is justified on the basis of “samaritanism” duties that we owe to those in need - our duties to assist those who are in serious peril when the assistance comes at little cost. This was one of the inspirations of my current position. David Sobel, “Backing Away from Libertarian Self-Ownership” (2012) - The first of a pair of papers that objects to the libertarian idea of self-ownership. This paper focuses on the implausible alleged implication of self-ownership that unnoticeably minor intrusions constitute rights violations. David Sobel, “Self-Ownership and the Conflation Problem” (2012) - The second paper from Sobel criticizing self-ownership. In this paper, he argues that libertarianism based on self-ownership is incapable of distinguishing the moral wrongness of minor intrusions and major intrusions when intuitively such a difference makes a huge difference morally. Eric Mack, “Elbow Room for Rights” (2015) in Oxford Studies in Political Philosophy, Volume 1 - Defends libertarianism from the objections put forth by Sobel and Railton. In it, Mack argues for what he calls the “elbow room postulate” (which I referred to as the “anti-paralysis postulate in this post) in order to permit the minor intrusions mentioned by Sobel and Railton. He also argues that other attempted solutions to the problem of minor intrusions fail to address the problem as well as the “elbow room postulate”. [archive] [selected papers by Eric Mack] Brennan and Van der Vossen, “The myths of the self-ownership Thesis” (2017) - Argues against many of the assumptions people have about self-ownership and libertarianism in general. They spend some time responding to Sobel’s objection based on minor intrusions. They also make the interesting claim that all liberals (not just libertarians) hold some form of the self-ownership thesis - the only live debate is over which conception of self-ownership to adopt. Published in The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism. The Google Books preview of the book contains this paper in its entirety. Nicolás Maloberti, “Libertarianism and Exception Rights” (2017) - This is the primary inspiration for my current position. Maloberti uses principles for delineating rights put forth by Mack and other libertarians in order to argue for exception rights. He uses exception rights to provide a justification for the state. Published in The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism. The Google Books preview of the book contains this paper in its entirety. David Sobel, “The point of Self-ownership” (2018) - Consists largely of objecting to the response by Mack in his 2015 paper “Elbow Room for Rights”. He argues that Mack’s “elbow room postulate” cannot adequately handle the problem of minor intrusions without allowing for other conclusions that libertarians tend to reject.

Since abortions kill fetuses, it follows that abortions should be illegal. Roughly speaking, the standard pro-life argument can be given in syllogistic form as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fetuses are persons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It should be illegal to kill a person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abortion kills a fetus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[from 1 and 2] Therefore, it should be illegal to kill a fetus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[from 3 and 4] Therefore, abortion should be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument here is clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://iep.utm.edu/val-snd/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;valid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Yet many people (pro-choicers) disagree with the conclusion. Therefore, the debate between pro-lifers and pro-choicers must revolve around the truth of some of the premises. The majority of the abortion debate seems to revolve around premise 1, whether the fetus is a person. These debates often involve complex philosophical questions regarding consciousness, sentience, vagueness, etc. and scientific questions regarding when certain features become present in the fetus. While these disputes are important, I fear they may be practically irresolvable. Fortunately, I think progress can be made in the abortion debate (in favor of the pro-choice position) by sidestepping these disputes. For the sake of argument, I’m willing to grant premise 1 of the pro-life argument, that fetuses are persons. I’m also willing to grant premise 3 as well (even though some pro-choicers argue that abortions do not &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; fetuses; they merely result in the death of fetuses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I reject the conclusion of this argument and because I have granted premise 1 and premise 3, I must reject premise 2 of this argument. I think a good argument can be given to show that premise 2 is false in the case of abortion. By “good” argument, I mean an argument based on principles that cohere with our shared considered intuitions better than principles supporting any pro-life conclusion. More specifically, I believe that premise 2 can be shown to be false from intuitions that even most pro-lifers hold. If I am correct, then most pro-lifers should reject the pro-life position (assuming they are pro-life because of arguments similar to the standard pro-life argument given above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reformulating-premise-2&quot;&gt;Reformulating Premise 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as it stands, premise 2 is clearly untenable if given a &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; formulation, because there are plenty of exceptions to its conclusive form: killing a person in order to prevent that person from killing someone else (defense), killing a person with their consent to relieve them of extreme suffering, killing a person to relieve them of extreme suffering even if they are unable to communicate their consent, killing enemies during war, etc. So premise 2 clearly needs to be modified in order to not produce a strawman pro-life argument. Does this mean that premise 2 should be modified to include all exceptions? E.g. should premise 2 say, “It should be illegal to perform any action that involves killing a person &lt;em&gt;unless it is killing in self-defense or killing to relieve someone of extreme suffering or killing in war or…&lt;/em&gt;”? There are a few reasons why we shouldn’t do this. Firstly, there could in principle be an unbounded number of exceptions to any conclusive formulation of premise 2 and I don’t think we should ever be confident that we have accounted for all of them. Secondly, and more importantly, we should avoid a conclusive formulation because - if the principle has not accounted for all exceptions - this allows a pro-choicer to technically &lt;em&gt;refute the argument&lt;/em&gt; given against abortion without actually &lt;em&gt;defending abortion&lt;/em&gt; from the argument given. For example, imagine a pro-choicer rejected the conclusion of the above argument by noting an exception to premise 2, namely that it should be legal to kill someone with their consent to relieve them of extreme suffering. While this technically &lt;em&gt;refutes the argument&lt;/em&gt; given against abortion (by showing the argument to be unsound), it does nothing to actually &lt;em&gt;defend abortion&lt;/em&gt; from the argument given, because abortion is never done with the fetus’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I believe the appropriate modification for premise 2 is to formulate it, not as a &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; principle with a list of exceptions, but rather as a &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; principle. By “prima facie” principle, I mean that premise 2 entails we should outlaw any action that involves killing &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; one can show an &lt;em&gt;overriding&lt;/em&gt; principle that explains why that specific action should be legal. I borrow the definition of “prima facie” as it is used &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1598&quot;&gt;in legal contexts&lt;/a&gt; where it refers to “a lawsuit or criminal prosecution in which the evidence before trial is &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; to prove the case unless there is substantial contradictory evidence presented at trial” (famous philosopher W.D. Ross &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-david-ross/#Rig&quot;&gt;appealed to prima facie duties&lt;/a&gt; in his moral framework). Formulated in this fashion, the pro-choicer can only technically refute the argument by &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; defending abortion, since one would need to provide some positive principle or reason that applies to abortion which overrides the prima-facie principle against legalizing killing. So premise 2 should be formulated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt; (AKP): there is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to outlaw any action that kills a person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is clearly acceptable. Pro-choice advocates should also accept this. To deny that there is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to outlaw killing would be a huge bullet to bite. However, accepting AKP doesn’t commit one to the pro-life position because AKP merely establishes a &lt;em&gt;prima-facie,&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt;, reason to outlaw killing. The pro-choice advocate should grant AKP but argue for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iep.utm.edu/ep-defea/&quot;&gt;defeater&lt;/a&gt; of AKP that justifies the legalization of abortion. When I say “defeater” for a principle, I simply mean a further principle that overrides the original principle in certain specified contexts (see the SEP article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/#DefeReas&quot;&gt;defeasible reasoning&lt;/a&gt;). This is what I will argue in this post. More specifically, I will argue that AKP is defeated by another principle in the case of abortion. And I will do so by appeal to intuitions accepted by the majority of pro-lifers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bodily-integrity&quot;&gt;Bodily Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My argument is basically an extension of Judith Jarvis Thomson’s famous violinist thought experiment in “&lt;a href=&quot;http://belmont.bme.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/377/2018/02/3-A-Defense-of-Abortion.pdf&quot;&gt;A Defense of Abortion&lt;/a&gt;”. Thomson asks us to imagine that you wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped with your kidney’s hooked up to a famous violinist’s circulatory system. The violinist has a fatal kidney ailment and your kidneys are needed to extract poisons from his blood. The violinist will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Thomson here is mainly concerned with the &lt;em&gt;moral permissibility&lt;/em&gt; of disconnecting from the violinist and of abortions. However, this thought experiment can also be used to show that abortions &lt;em&gt;should be legal&lt;/em&gt; (quite apart from whether they are morally permissible). It seems that it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be legal to disconnect from the violinist in this thought experiment because the violinist, while he is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use your body. Likewise, we should also conclude that abortions should be legal because the fetus, while it is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use the mother’s body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While such an example may seem fantastical, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFall_v._Shimp&quot;&gt;McFall v. Shimp&lt;/a&gt; was an actual court case concerning whether to force someone to donate bodily tissue to save someone else’s life. Because of a rare bone marrow disease, Robert McFall required a bone marrow transfusion in order to avoid certain death. The only available match for the transfusion was McFall’s cousin David Shimp. Unfortunately for McFall, Shimp refused to undergo the procedure, which prompted McFall to sue his cousin in an effort to force him to donate his bone marrow. The court ultimately ruled that Shimp had the right to refuse the transfusion. Judge John P. Flaherty Jr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leagle.com/decision/197810010padampc3d90189&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; “The common law has consistently held to a rule which provides that one human being is under no legal compulsion to give aid or to take action to save another human being or to rescue…To do so would defeat the sanctity of the individual, and would impose a rule which would know no limits, and one could not imagine where the line would be drawn.” I think the court’s decision here lines up with most of our intuitions (including - I would assume - most pro-lifers). Shimp should be legally allowed to refuse the bone marrow transfusion because McFall, while he is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use Shimp’s body. Likewise, we should also conclude that abortions should be legal because the fetus, while it is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use the mother’s body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a few points of disanalogy between pregnancies and the violinist thought experiment and the McFall v. Shimp case. For one, the McFall v. Shimp case doesn’t actually involve any “disconnecting” like abortion does, but I think our intuitions would remain undisturbed if we imagine that Shimp woke up and found himself attached to a machine without his consent to initiate the bone marrow transfusion. Secondly, the violinist is an unknown stranger, whereas the fetus is the offspring of the mother, and a pro-lifer might say that parents have special obligations to their offspring. However, I think this worry can be accommodated by imaging that you wake up to find yourself hooked up to your infant son instead of a violinist. Call this &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt;: imagine that you wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped and hooked up to your infant son’s circulatory system. Your son has a fatal kidney ailment and your kidneys are needed to extract poisons from his blood. He will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most people, including most pro-lifers, would agree that  you should be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1__.&lt;/em&gt; So_,_ while most people accept the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle (AKP)&lt;/em&gt;, most also accept a separate principle that &lt;em&gt;defeats&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;AKP&lt;/em&gt; in certain cases. Call this the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt;. The pro-choicer, then, can accept the following two claims to explain why abortion should be legal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Principle&lt;/em&gt; (AKP): there is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; (BIP): the reason given by the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; merely &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeats AKP to allow for the possibility that it might not defeat AKP in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; contexts. Now, there are two possible responses from pro-lifers. Firstly, Pro-lifers can deny &lt;em&gt;BIP&lt;/em&gt;. But very few pro-lifers take this response. Almost everyone thinks you should have the right to disconnect from the violinist, to refrain from assisting Shimp, and to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, almost everyone accepts the &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; importance of bodily integrity as outlined in &lt;em&gt;BIP.&lt;/em&gt; The second possible response by pro-lifers is to grant &lt;em&gt;BIP__,&lt;/em&gt; but provide some further principle that actually defeats &lt;em&gt;BIP&lt;/em&gt; in the case of abortion. I will focus on this response in this post since it is the more common response. I will argue that this response fails, which means that if one should be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt;, then one should also be legally allowed to abort a pregnancy (since the &lt;em&gt;BIP&lt;/em&gt; would permit one to disconnect in both cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibility&quot;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, most pro-lifers accept the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; but argue that, while it applies in cases such as &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt;, it does not apply to the case of abortion. The most cited distinction between abortion and cases like &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt; of the agent_._ The vast majority of pregnancies are the result of women engaging in &lt;em&gt;consensual&lt;/em&gt; intercourse with the &lt;em&gt;foreseeable&lt;/em&gt; consequence of pregnancy, which means women are responsible for their pregnancies in most cases (I will concede to the pro-lifer that this is sufficient to constitute responsibility). However, in the violinist thought experiment, you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; responsible for the violinist being dependent on your body, and Shimp is not responsible for McFall being dependent on him either. Note that, according to this argument, the pro-lifer should grant that pregnant women should be allowed to receive abortions for pregnancies &lt;em&gt;due to rape&lt;/em&gt; (indeed, most &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/257627/alabama-bill-odds-public-consensus-abortion.aspx&quot;&gt;pro-choicers and pro-lifers support legalizing abortions for pregnancies due to rape&lt;/a&gt;). However, according to this argument, the pro-lifer is committed to saying that one should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt; if one is responsible for the infant being in their needy conditions. This is a far more controversial claim. Consider the following modification of the &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion&lt;/em&gt; case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2&lt;/em&gt;: imagine that you voluntarily decide to coat the interior of your home with a dangerous brand of paint that has the foreseeable consequence of causing a fatal kidney ailment in your infant son which will make him require blood transfusions from yourself. Your son consequently develops the ailment and is in need of a blood transfusion. You wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped and hooked up to his circulatory system. He will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pro-lifer who uses the responsibility objection to morally distinguish aborting pregnancies due to consensual sex and disconnecting in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt; must argue that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2&lt;/em&gt; (since you would be responsible in this case). This means that the pro-lifer accepts a separate principle that defeats the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; in certain cases. Call this principle the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, pro-lifers can accept the following claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Principle&lt;/em&gt; (AKP): there is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; (BIP): the reason given by the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; (RP): the defeater given by the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; is itself &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the agent performed a voluntary decision that had the foreseeable consequence of causing the needy person to depend on such infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pro-lifer grants that one should be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1&lt;/em&gt; because of the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt;, yet maintains that one should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2&lt;/em&gt; because of the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, such pro-lifers can grant that mothers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be legally allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape because of the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt;, yet maintain that mothers should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be legally allowed to perform abortions for pregnancies due to consensual intercourse because of the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One pro-choice response is to simply reject the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt;. Judith Thomson does just this in her paper. After all, is it really plausible that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2?&lt;/em&gt; While this might be an acceptable response for pro-choicers, I don’t believe it’s a suitable response for my purposes here. Recall that my goal is to show that the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt; is defeated in the case of abortion by appeal to intuitions accepted by the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of pro-lifers. Thus, I think a more suitable pro-choice response is to grant the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; and grant that one should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to disconnect in &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2&lt;/em&gt; (which grants a lot to the pro-life argument). Despite these concessions, I will argue that one can maintain that abortions should be legal because of some other principle that defeats the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; in the case of abortions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deprivation&quot;&gt;Deprivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle,&lt;/em&gt; while it has &lt;em&gt;prima-facie force,&lt;/em&gt; does not apply in the case of abortion (even for pregnancies that are due to consensual intercourse). Namely, the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; does not apply because the agent’s voluntary action that makes them responsible - i.e. consensual intercourse - does not result in the &lt;em&gt;deprivation&lt;/em&gt; of life. A similar argument was given by David Boonin in his paper “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingscollege.net/gbrodie/14-Boonin.pdf&quot;&gt;A defense of “A Defense of Abortion”: On the responsibility objection to Thomson’s argument&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grant that a woman who becomes pregnant due to consensual intercourse is &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for the fetus being dependent on her body, but I deny that she is responsible &lt;em&gt;in the relevant sense&lt;/em&gt; for the fetus’s circumstances. What do I mean by “in the relevant sense”? Typically, to say that an action makes an agent responsible for a victim’s needy circumstances implies that, if not for the agent’s action, the victim would have continued their life without being in those needy circumstances. This describes &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 2.&lt;/em&gt; The hidden assumption is that if you never coated your home with the toxic paint, then the infant’s life could have continued just fine without him being in need of a blood transfusion. This hidden assumption explains why it might seem intuitive to pro-lifers that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect:  by (a) coating the home and (b) disconnecting the blood transfusion, these combined actions &lt;em&gt;deprive&lt;/em&gt; the infant of a life that he would have otherwise had. However, this kind of deprivation is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; applicable to abortion. The fetus would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have had &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; life (let alone a good life) had the woman not conceived it. Whereas the combined action of (a) coating the home and (b) disconnecting the blood transfusion deprives the infant of a life that he might have otherwise had, the combined action of (a) conceiving a fetus and (b) aborting the pregnancy does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; deprive the fetus of a life that it might have otherwise had. Therefore, the woman should be allowed to abort the fetus. To illustrate the importance of deprivation, consider another variation of the blood transfusion thought experiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 3&lt;/em&gt;: imagine that your infant son has a fatal kidney ailment through no fault of your own. He requires a series of blood transfusions in order to live which requires you to remain connected to him for the next nine months. If you do not connect immediately, he will die within an hour. You voluntarily decide to connect and commence the transfusions. One day passes. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most would agree that you absolutely should be legally allowed to disconnect. Technically, you are &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; “responsible” for your son’s predicament because, had you not initially connected, he wouldn’t be in this needy condition. However, you are not responsible in the &lt;em&gt;relevant sense&lt;/em&gt; because, had you not initially connected, &lt;em&gt;he wouldn’t even be alive&lt;/em&gt; (remember, he would have died within an hour if you didn’t connect). Thus, even though your initial voluntary action makes you &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for your son’s predicament, it does not follow that you should be legally forced to remain connected. You should be &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; allowed to disconnect because this would not &lt;em&gt;deprive&lt;/em&gt; him of a life that he would have had without the initial connection. Likewise, the pro-choicer can grant that a pregnant woman is &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for putting the fetus in their dependent predicament. However, she is not responsible in the &lt;em&gt;relevant sense&lt;/em&gt; because, had she never conceived the fetus, &lt;em&gt;the fetus wouldn’t even be alive&lt;/em&gt;. Thus, even though a woman’s initial consensual intercourse makes her &lt;em&gt;causally&lt;/em&gt; responsible for the fetus being in its predicament, it does not follow that she should be forced to remain connected to the fetus. She should be legally allowed to disconnect because this would not &lt;em&gt;deprive&lt;/em&gt; the fetus of a life that it would have had without the initial intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on this pro-choice argument, the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle,&lt;/em&gt; while it has prima-facie force, is defeated by another principle in the case of abortion. Call this the &lt;em&gt;Lack of Deprivation Principle&lt;/em&gt;. The pro-choice argument I’m giving accepts the following four claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Principle&lt;/em&gt; (AKP): there is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; (BIP): the reason given by the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; (RP): the defeater given by the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; is itself &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the agent performed a voluntary decision that had the foreseeable consequence of causing the needy person to depend on such infringements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Deprivation Principle&lt;/em&gt; (LDP): the defeater given by the &lt;em&gt;Responsibility Principle&lt;/em&gt; is itself &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; defeated when the needy person would not have been alive if not for the agent’s initial voluntary decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this pro-choice argument, in very rough terms, while responsibility &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; trumps bodily integrity, the lack of deprivation trumps responsibility in the case of pregnancies. The fact that consensual intercourse makes women &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; responsible for the pregnancy is irrelevant because this consensual intercourse doesn’t deprive the fetus of a life that they would have otherwise had. Because responsibility is irrelevant, we ought to treat pregnancies due to rape the same as we treat pregnancies due to consensual intercourse. Therefore, because respect for bodily integrity demands the legalization of abortions for pregnancies due to rape (as most pro-lifers agree), respect for bodily integrity also demands the legalization of abortions for pregnancies due to consensual intercourse. We should be pro-choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-responses&quot;&gt;Some Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the argument support legal infanticide or intentionally letting one’s child die?&lt;/strong&gt; Outside of extreme conditions (e.g. the fetus needs someone’s kidney to live), no. If I gave &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; importance to bodily integrity, then the argument would support infanticide, or at least intentionally &lt;em&gt;letting&lt;/em&gt; one’s child die (because preventing an infant from dying requires expending some bodily resources, e.g. caloric resources). However, the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; does not give absolute importance to bodily integrity. The principle gives bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers would recognize that forcing a mother to donate an organ to save her infant’s life would be a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringement and therefore impermissible, whereas forcing a mother to seek a responsible caretaker for her infant (if she refuses to care for the child herself) is a &lt;em&gt;non-serious&lt;/em&gt; infringement and is therefore permissible. Because the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; only concerns &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringements to their bodily integrity, the argument is not committed to supporting infanticide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the argument imply that parents should not be legally forced to provide financial support?&lt;/strong&gt; No. Again, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; I gave &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; importance to bodily integrity, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; my argument would be committed to denying that parents should be forced to provide financial support (because acquiring the financial resources to pay the child support requires expending some bodily resources, e.g. caloric resources). But my argument does not give absolute importance to bodily integrity. Again, my argument relies on giving bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers recognize that there is a morally relevant distinction between, say, forcing a father to provide child support and forcing a father to donate an organ to save their child. The latter would be a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringement and therefore impermissible, but the former would be a &lt;em&gt;non-serious&lt;/em&gt; infringement and is therefore permissible. Because the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; only concerns &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringements to their bodily integrity, the argument does not imply that parents should not be legally forced to pay child support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we know that undergoing pregnancy and giving birth counts as a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringement?&lt;/strong&gt; I believe most reasonable people, including most pro-lifers, already agree that pregnancy and giving birth are serious infringements to bodily integrity. As mentioned earlier, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/257627/alabama-bill-odds-public-consensus-abortion.aspx&quot;&gt;most pro-lifers&lt;/a&gt; believe a woman should be legally allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape. However, most people, even most pro-choicers, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe that a mother should be legally allowed to let her infant die if the child was conceived out of rape. The difference between these two intuitions (which most pro-lifers and most pro-choicers share) must lie in the fact that pregnancy and giving birth constitute &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; infringements to bodily integrity (whereas expending resources to prevent an infant’s death is only a non-serious infringement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the argument imply that pregnant mothers should be legally allowed to consume dangerous substances (e.g. drugs, alcohol, poisons, etc.) that cause pain to the fetus or stunt its development after birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; No, my argument only appeals to bodily integrity to defeat the &lt;em&gt;Anti-Killing Principle&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, bodily integrity only allows one to perform an action that &lt;em&gt;kills&lt;/em&gt; someone else. It doesn’t necessarily allow one to cause &lt;em&gt;suffering&lt;/em&gt; to someone. Now, one might ask how one can be allowed to kill someone while not being allowed to cause unnecessary suffering. This is a good question, but I don’t think it’s a question that my argument needs to answer. Most people (including most pro-lifers) &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; accept that bodily integrity can allow killing a being without accepting that it allows causing unnecessary suffering. For example, even most pro-lifers accept that abortions should be legally allowed for pregnancies due to rape. However, does this mean most pro-lifers are committed to believing that the pregnant mother should be legally allowed to consume dangerous substances during pregnancies due to rape? Of course not! Even pro-lifers can agree that there is a morally relevant distinction between using bodily integrity to allow killing a being and using bodily integrity to allow causing suffering. My argument appeals to this distinction that even pro-lifers already accept. Thus, my argument is not committed to legalizing the consumption of dangerous substances during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this argument support legalizing late-term abortions?&lt;/strong&gt; Not necessarily. Again, my argument relies on giving bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers believe that bodily integrity supports legalizing abortion for pregnancies due to rape. However, most pro-lifers (probably) do not support legalizing &lt;em&gt;late-term&lt;/em&gt; abortion for pregnancies due to rape. Assuming this distinction is sustainable, my argument is not committed either way to whether late-term abortions should be legal. Of course, there might be independent reasons for denying that this distinction can be sustained, but my argument does not take a stand either way on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why accept this argument?&lt;/strong&gt; Like most arguments in applied ethics, my argument rests on intuitions. I believe my argument should be accepted because it coheres with the shared intuitions of most people, including most pro-lifers. It does this in two ways. Firstly, accepting my argument does not lead to extremely unintuitive conclusions. For example, as shown earlier, the argument is not committed to supporting late-term abortions, financial negligence, infanticide, or fetal abuse. It also accounts for the wrongness of killing and the importance of responsibility that most pro-lifers find to be important. Secondly, rejecting my argument requires either (a) rejecting the prima-facie force of the Bodily Integrity Principle and the Lack of Deprivation Principle, or (b) granting the prima-facie force of these principles, but maintaining that they are defeated by some other reason or principle. Both lead to unacceptable conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s say one rejects either the prima-facie force of the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Lack of Deprivation Principle.&lt;/em&gt; This leads to the unintuitive conclusion that one should not be allowed to disconnect in either &lt;em&gt;Blood Transfusion 1 or Blood Transfusion 3&lt;/em&gt; (or both). Thus, this option is unacceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let’s say one accepts the prima-facie force of both the &lt;em&gt;Bodily Integrity Principle&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Lack of Deprivation Principle__,&lt;/em&gt; but deny that they apply to abortion because of some further defeater(s). These further defeaters should be based on principles which themselves cohere with our shared intuitions. I don’t believe that such principles can be provided. Until such principles are provided, this option is also unacceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">The standard pro-life argument against the legalization of abortion is based on the premise that fetuses are persons, combined with the widely held view that it should be illegal to kill persons. Since abortions kill fetuses, it follows that abortions should be illegal. Roughly speaking, the standard pro-life argument can be given in syllogistic form as follows: Fetuses are persons. It should be illegal to kill a person. Abortion kills a fetus. [from 1 and 2] Therefore, it should be illegal to kill a fetus. [from 3 and 4] Therefore, abortion should be illegal. The argument here is clearly valid. Yet many people (pro-choicers) disagree with the conclusion. Therefore, the debate between pro-lifers and pro-choicers must revolve around the truth of some of the premises. The majority of the abortion debate seems to revolve around premise 1, whether the fetus is a person. These debates often involve complex philosophical questions regarding consciousness, sentience, vagueness, etc. and scientific questions regarding when certain features become present in the fetus. While these disputes are important, I fear they may be practically irresolvable. Fortunately, I think progress can be made in the abortion debate (in favor of the pro-choice position) by sidestepping these disputes. For the sake of argument, I’m willing to grant premise 1 of the pro-life argument, that fetuses are persons. I’m also willing to grant premise 3 as well (even though some pro-choicers argue that abortions do not kill fetuses; they merely result in the death of fetuses). Because I reject the conclusion of this argument and because I have granted premise 1 and premise 3, I must reject premise 2 of this argument. I think a good argument can be given to show that premise 2 is false in the case of abortion. By “good” argument, I mean an argument based on principles that cohere with our shared considered intuitions better than principles supporting any pro-life conclusion. More specifically, I believe that premise 2 can be shown to be false from intuitions that even most pro-lifers hold. If I am correct, then most pro-lifers should reject the pro-life position (assuming they are pro-life because of arguments similar to the standard pro-life argument given above). Reformulating Premise 2 Now, as it stands, premise 2 is clearly untenable if given a conclusive formulation, because there are plenty of exceptions to its conclusive form: killing a person in order to prevent that person from killing someone else (defense), killing a person with their consent to relieve them of extreme suffering, killing a person to relieve them of extreme suffering even if they are unable to communicate their consent, killing enemies during war, etc. So premise 2 clearly needs to be modified in order to not produce a strawman pro-life argument. Does this mean that premise 2 should be modified to include all exceptions? E.g. should premise 2 say, “It should be illegal to perform any action that involves killing a person unless it is killing in self-defense or killing to relieve someone of extreme suffering or killing in war or…”? There are a few reasons why we shouldn’t do this. Firstly, there could in principle be an unbounded number of exceptions to any conclusive formulation of premise 2 and I don’t think we should ever be confident that we have accounted for all of them. Secondly, and more importantly, we should avoid a conclusive formulation because - if the principle has not accounted for all exceptions - this allows a pro-choicer to technically refute the argument given against abortion without actually defending abortion from the argument given. For example, imagine a pro-choicer rejected the conclusion of the above argument by noting an exception to premise 2, namely that it should be legal to kill someone with their consent to relieve them of extreme suffering. While this technically refutes the argument given against abortion (by showing the argument to be unsound), it does nothing to actually defend abortion from the argument given, because abortion is never done with the fetus’s consent. Instead, I believe the appropriate modification for premise 2 is to formulate it, not as a conclusive principle with a list of exceptions, but rather as a prima-facie principle. By “prima facie” principle, I mean that premise 2 entails we should outlaw any action that involves killing unless one can show an overriding principle that explains why that specific action should be legal. I borrow the definition of “prima facie” as it is used in legal contexts where it refers to “a lawsuit or criminal prosecution in which the evidence before trial is sufficient to prove the case unless there is substantial contradictory evidence presented at trial” (famous philosopher W.D. Ross appealed to prima facie duties in his moral framework). Formulated in this fashion, the pro-choicer can only technically refute the argument by actually defending abortion, since one would need to provide some positive principle or reason that applies to abortion which overrides the prima-facie principle against legalizing killing. So premise 2 should be formulated as follows: Anti-Killing Principle (AKP): there is prima-facie reason to outlaw any action that kills a person. Now this is clearly acceptable. Pro-choice advocates should also accept this. To deny that there is prima-facie reason to outlaw killing would be a huge bullet to bite. However, accepting AKP doesn’t commit one to the pro-life position because AKP merely establishes a prima-facie, rather than conclusive, reason to outlaw killing. The pro-choice advocate should grant AKP but argue for a defeater of AKP that justifies the legalization of abortion. When I say “defeater” for a principle, I simply mean a further principle that overrides the original principle in certain specified contexts (see the SEP article on defeasible reasoning). This is what I will argue in this post. More specifically, I will argue that AKP is defeated by another principle in the case of abortion. And I will do so by appeal to intuitions accepted by the majority of pro-lifers. Bodily Integrity My argument is basically an extension of Judith Jarvis Thomson’s famous violinist thought experiment in “A Defense of Abortion”. Thomson asks us to imagine that you wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped with your kidney’s hooked up to a famous violinist’s circulatory system. The violinist has a fatal kidney ailment and your kidneys are needed to extract poisons from his blood. The violinist will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Thomson here is mainly concerned with the moral permissibility of disconnecting from the violinist and of abortions. However, this thought experiment can also be used to show that abortions should be legal (quite apart from whether they are morally permissible). It seems that it should be legal to disconnect from the violinist in this thought experiment because the violinist, while he is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use your body. Likewise, we should also conclude that abortions should be legal because the fetus, while it is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use the mother’s body. While such an example may seem fantastical, McFall v. Shimp was an actual court case concerning whether to force someone to donate bodily tissue to save someone else’s life. Because of a rare bone marrow disease, Robert McFall required a bone marrow transfusion in order to avoid certain death. The only available match for the transfusion was McFall’s cousin David Shimp. Unfortunately for McFall, Shimp refused to undergo the procedure, which prompted McFall to sue his cousin in an effort to force him to donate his bone marrow. The court ultimately ruled that Shimp had the right to refuse the transfusion. Judge John P. Flaherty Jr. stated “The common law has consistently held to a rule which provides that one human being is under no legal compulsion to give aid or to take action to save another human being or to rescue…To do so would defeat the sanctity of the individual, and would impose a rule which would know no limits, and one could not imagine where the line would be drawn.” I think the court’s decision here lines up with most of our intuitions (including - I would assume - most pro-lifers). Shimp should be legally allowed to refuse the bone marrow transfusion because McFall, while he is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use Shimp’s body. Likewise, we should also conclude that abortions should be legal because the fetus, while it is a person with a right to life, does not have the right to use the mother’s body. Now, there are a few points of disanalogy between pregnancies and the violinist thought experiment and the McFall v. Shimp case. For one, the McFall v. Shimp case doesn’t actually involve any “disconnecting” like abortion does, but I think our intuitions would remain undisturbed if we imagine that Shimp woke up and found himself attached to a machine without his consent to initiate the bone marrow transfusion. Secondly, the violinist is an unknown stranger, whereas the fetus is the offspring of the mother, and a pro-lifer might say that parents have special obligations to their offspring. However, I think this worry can be accommodated by imaging that you wake up to find yourself hooked up to your infant son instead of a violinist. Call this Blood Transfusion 1: Blood Transfusion 1: imagine that you wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped and hooked up to your infant son’s circulatory system. Your son has a fatal kidney ailment and your kidneys are needed to extract poisons from his blood. He will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect? I think most people, including most pro-lifers, would agree that you should be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 1__. So_,_ while most people accept the Anti-Killing Principle (AKP), most also accept a separate principle that defeats AKP in certain cases. Call this the Bodily Integrity Principle. The pro-choicer, then, can accept the following two claims to explain why abortion should be legal: Anti-Killing Principle (AKP): there is prima-facie reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person. Bodily Integrity Principle (BIP): the reason given by the Anti-Killing Principle is prima-facie defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements. I say that the Bodily Integrity Principle merely prima-facie defeats AKP to allow for the possibility that it might not defeat AKP in all contexts. Now, there are two possible responses from pro-lifers. Firstly, Pro-lifers can deny BIP. But very few pro-lifers take this response. Almost everyone thinks you should have the right to disconnect from the violinist, to refrain from assisting Shimp, and to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 1. In other words, almost everyone accepts the prima-facie importance of bodily integrity as outlined in BIP. The second possible response by pro-lifers is to grant BIP__, but provide some further principle that actually defeats BIP in the case of abortion. I will focus on this response in this post since it is the more common response. I will argue that this response fails, which means that if one should be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 1, then one should also be legally allowed to abort a pregnancy (since the BIP would permit one to disconnect in both cases). Responsibility As stated earlier, most pro-lifers accept the Bodily Integrity Principle but argue that, while it applies in cases such as Blood Transfusion 1, it does not apply to the case of abortion. The most cited distinction between abortion and cases like Blood Transfusion 1 is the responsibility of the agent_._ The vast majority of pregnancies are the result of women engaging in consensual intercourse with the foreseeable consequence of pregnancy, which means women are responsible for their pregnancies in most cases (I will concede to the pro-lifer that this is sufficient to constitute responsibility). However, in the violinist thought experiment, you are not responsible for the violinist being dependent on your body, and Shimp is not responsible for McFall being dependent on him either. Note that, according to this argument, the pro-lifer should grant that pregnant women should be allowed to receive abortions for pregnancies due to rape (indeed, most pro-choicers and pro-lifers support legalizing abortions for pregnancies due to rape). However, according to this argument, the pro-lifer is committed to saying that one should not be allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 1 if one is responsible for the infant being in their needy conditions. This is a far more controversial claim. Consider the following modification of the Blood Transfusion case: Blood Transfusion 2: imagine that you voluntarily decide to coat the interior of your home with a dangerous brand of paint that has the foreseeable consequence of causing a fatal kidney ailment in your infant son which will make him require blood transfusions from yourself. Your son consequently develops the ailment and is in need of a blood transfusion. You wake up and find that you’ve been kidnapped and hooked up to his circulatory system. He will fully recover in nine months so long as you do not prematurely disconnect. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect? The pro-lifer who uses the responsibility objection to morally distinguish aborting pregnancies due to consensual sex and disconnecting in Blood Transfusion 1 must argue that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 2 (since you would be responsible in this case). This means that the pro-lifer accepts a separate principle that defeats the Bodily Integrity Principle in certain cases. Call this principle the Responsibility Principle. Thus, pro-lifers can accept the following claims: Anti-Killing Principle (AKP): there is prima-facie reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person. Bodily Integrity Principle (BIP): the reason given by the Anti-Killing Principle is prima-facie defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements. Responsibility Principle (RP): the defeater given by the Bodily Integrity Principle is itself prima-facie defeated when the agent performed a voluntary decision that had the foreseeable consequence of causing the needy person to depend on such infringements. The pro-lifer grants that one should be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 1 because of the Bodily Integrity Principle, yet maintains that one should not be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 2 because of the Responsibility Principle. Similarly, such pro-lifers can grant that mothers should be legally allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape because of the Bodily Integrity Principle, yet maintain that mothers should not be legally allowed to perform abortions for pregnancies due to consensual intercourse because of the Responsibility Principle. One pro-choice response is to simply reject the Responsibility Principle. Judith Thomson does just this in her paper. After all, is it really plausible that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 2? While this might be an acceptable response for pro-choicers, I don’t believe it’s a suitable response for my purposes here. Recall that my goal is to show that the Anti-Killing Principle is defeated in the case of abortion by appeal to intuitions accepted by the majority of pro-lifers. Thus, I think a more suitable pro-choice response is to grant the Responsibility Principle and grant that one should not be allowed to disconnect in Blood Transfusion 2 (which grants a lot to the pro-life argument). Despite these concessions, I will argue that one can maintain that abortions should be legal because of some other principle that defeats the Responsibility Principle in the case of abortions. Deprivation I believe that the Responsibility Principle, while it has prima-facie force, does not apply in the case of abortion (even for pregnancies that are due to consensual intercourse). Namely, the Responsibility Principle does not apply because the agent’s voluntary action that makes them responsible - i.e. consensual intercourse - does not result in the deprivation of life. A similar argument was given by David Boonin in his paper “A defense of “A Defense of Abortion”: On the responsibility objection to Thomson’s argument”. I grant that a woman who becomes pregnant due to consensual intercourse is causally responsible for the fetus being dependent on her body, but I deny that she is responsible in the relevant sense for the fetus’s circumstances. What do I mean by “in the relevant sense”? Typically, to say that an action makes an agent responsible for a victim’s needy circumstances implies that, if not for the agent’s action, the victim would have continued their life without being in those needy circumstances. This describes Blood Transfusion 2. The hidden assumption is that if you never coated your home with the toxic paint, then the infant’s life could have continued just fine without him being in need of a blood transfusion. This hidden assumption explains why it might seem intuitive to pro-lifers that you should not be legally allowed to disconnect: by (a) coating the home and (b) disconnecting the blood transfusion, these combined actions deprive the infant of a life that he would have otherwise had. However, this kind of deprivation is not applicable to abortion. The fetus would not have had any life (let alone a good life) had the woman not conceived it. Whereas the combined action of (a) coating the home and (b) disconnecting the blood transfusion deprives the infant of a life that he might have otherwise had, the combined action of (a) conceiving a fetus and (b) aborting the pregnancy does not deprive the fetus of a life that it might have otherwise had. Therefore, the woman should be allowed to abort the fetus. To illustrate the importance of deprivation, consider another variation of the blood transfusion thought experiment: Blood Transfusion 3: imagine that your infant son has a fatal kidney ailment through no fault of your own. He requires a series of blood transfusions in order to live which requires you to remain connected to him for the next nine months. If you do not connect immediately, he will die within an hour. You voluntarily decide to connect and commence the transfusions. One day passes. Should you be legally allowed to disconnect at this point? I think most would agree that you absolutely should be legally allowed to disconnect. Technically, you are causally “responsible” for your son’s predicament because, had you not initially connected, he wouldn’t be in this needy condition. However, you are not responsible in the relevant sense because, had you not initially connected, he wouldn’t even be alive (remember, he would have died within an hour if you didn’t connect). Thus, even though your initial voluntary action makes you causally responsible for your son’s predicament, it does not follow that you should be legally forced to remain connected. You should be legally allowed to disconnect because this would not deprive him of a life that he would have had without the initial connection. Likewise, the pro-choicer can grant that a pregnant woman is causally responsible for putting the fetus in their dependent predicament. However, she is not responsible in the relevant sense because, had she never conceived the fetus, the fetus wouldn’t even be alive. Thus, even though a woman’s initial consensual intercourse makes her causally responsible for the fetus being in its predicament, it does not follow that she should be forced to remain connected to the fetus. She should be legally allowed to disconnect because this would not deprive the fetus of a life that it would have had without the initial intercourse. So, on this pro-choice argument, the Responsibility Principle, while it has prima-facie force, is defeated by another principle in the case of abortion. Call this the Lack of Deprivation Principle. The pro-choice argument I’m giving accepts the following four claims: Anti-Killing Principle (AKP): there is prima-facie reason to outlaw any action that involves an agent killing another person. Bodily Integrity Principle (BIP): the reason given by the Anti-Killing Principle is prima-facie defeated when the action involves the agent preventing serious infringements to their bodily integrity which kills a person whose life relies on such infringements. Responsibility Principle (RP): the defeater given by the Bodily Integrity Principle is itself prima-facie defeated when the agent performed a voluntary decision that had the foreseeable consequence of causing the needy person to depend on such infringements. Lack of Deprivation Principle (LDP): the defeater given by the Responsibility Principle is itself prima-facie defeated when the needy person would not have been alive if not for the agent’s initial voluntary decision. On this pro-choice argument, in very rough terms, while responsibility typically trumps bodily integrity, the lack of deprivation trumps responsibility in the case of pregnancies. The fact that consensual intercourse makes women technically responsible for the pregnancy is irrelevant because this consensual intercourse doesn’t deprive the fetus of a life that they would have otherwise had. Because responsibility is irrelevant, we ought to treat pregnancies due to rape the same as we treat pregnancies due to consensual intercourse. Therefore, because respect for bodily integrity demands the legalization of abortions for pregnancies due to rape (as most pro-lifers agree), respect for bodily integrity also demands the legalization of abortions for pregnancies due to consensual intercourse. We should be pro-choice. Some Responses Does the argument support legal infanticide or intentionally letting one’s child die? Outside of extreme conditions (e.g. the fetus needs someone’s kidney to live), no. If I gave absolute importance to bodily integrity, then the argument would support infanticide, or at least intentionally letting one’s child die (because preventing an infant from dying requires expending some bodily resources, e.g. caloric resources). However, the Bodily Integrity Principle does not give absolute importance to bodily integrity. The principle gives bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers would recognize that forcing a mother to donate an organ to save her infant’s life would be a serious infringement and therefore impermissible, whereas forcing a mother to seek a responsible caretaker for her infant (if she refuses to care for the child herself) is a non-serious infringement and is therefore permissible. Because the Bodily Integrity Principle only concerns serious infringements to their bodily integrity, the argument is not committed to supporting infanticide. Does the argument imply that parents should not be legally forced to provide financial support? No. Again, if I gave absolute importance to bodily integrity, then my argument would be committed to denying that parents should be forced to provide financial support (because acquiring the financial resources to pay the child support requires expending some bodily resources, e.g. caloric resources). But my argument does not give absolute importance to bodily integrity. Again, my argument relies on giving bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers recognize that there is a morally relevant distinction between, say, forcing a father to provide child support and forcing a father to donate an organ to save their child. The latter would be a serious infringement and therefore impermissible, but the former would be a non-serious infringement and is therefore permissible. Because the Bodily Integrity Principle only concerns serious infringements to their bodily integrity, the argument does not imply that parents should not be legally forced to pay child support. How do we know that undergoing pregnancy and giving birth counts as a serious infringement? I believe most reasonable people, including most pro-lifers, already agree that pregnancy and giving birth are serious infringements to bodily integrity. As mentioned earlier, most pro-lifers believe a woman should be legally allowed to abort pregnancies due to rape. However, most people, even most pro-choicers, do not believe that a mother should be legally allowed to let her infant die if the child was conceived out of rape. The difference between these two intuitions (which most pro-lifers and most pro-choicers share) must lie in the fact that pregnancy and giving birth constitute serious infringements to bodily integrity (whereas expending resources to prevent an infant’s death is only a non-serious infringement). Does the argument imply that pregnant mothers should be legally allowed to consume dangerous substances (e.g. drugs, alcohol, poisons, etc.) that cause pain to the fetus or stunt its development after birth? No, my argument only appeals to bodily integrity to defeat the Anti-Killing Principle. In other words, bodily integrity only allows one to perform an action that kills someone else. It doesn’t necessarily allow one to cause suffering to someone. Now, one might ask how one can be allowed to kill someone while not being allowed to cause unnecessary suffering. This is a good question, but I don’t think it’s a question that my argument needs to answer. Most people (including most pro-lifers) already accept that bodily integrity can allow killing a being without accepting that it allows causing unnecessary suffering. For example, even most pro-lifers accept that abortions should be legally allowed for pregnancies due to rape. However, does this mean most pro-lifers are committed to believing that the pregnant mother should be legally allowed to consume dangerous substances during pregnancies due to rape? Of course not! Even pro-lifers can agree that there is a morally relevant distinction between using bodily integrity to allow killing a being and using bodily integrity to allow causing suffering. My argument appeals to this distinction that even pro-lifers already accept. Thus, my argument is not committed to legalizing the consumption of dangerous substances during pregnancy. Does this argument support legalizing late-term abortions? Not necessarily. Again, my argument relies on giving bodily integrity the same importance that is given by most pro-lifers. Most pro-lifers believe that bodily integrity supports legalizing abortion for pregnancies due to rape. However, most pro-lifers (probably) do not support legalizing late-term abortion for pregnancies due to rape. Assuming this distinction is sustainable, my argument is not committed either way to whether late-term abortions should be legal. Of course, there might be independent reasons for denying that this distinction can be sustained, but my argument does not take a stand either way on the issue. Why accept this argument? Like most arguments in applied ethics, my argument rests on intuitions. I believe my argument should be accepted because it coheres with the shared intuitions of most people, including most pro-lifers. It does this in two ways. Firstly, accepting my argument does not lead to extremely unintuitive conclusions. For example, as shown earlier, the argument is not committed to supporting late-term abortions, financial negligence, infanticide, or fetal abuse. It also accounts for the wrongness of killing and the importance of responsibility that most pro-lifers find to be important. Secondly, rejecting my argument requires either (a) rejecting the prima-facie force of the Bodily Integrity Principle and the Lack of Deprivation Principle, or (b) granting the prima-facie force of these principles, but maintaining that they are defeated by some other reason or principle. Both lead to unacceptable conclusions: Let’s say one rejects either the prima-facie force of the Bodily Integrity Principle or the Lack of Deprivation Principle. This leads to the unintuitive conclusion that one should not be allowed to disconnect in either Blood Transfusion 1 or Blood Transfusion 3 (or both). Thus, this option is unacceptable. Let’s say one accepts the prima-facie force of both the Bodily Integrity Principle and the Lack of Deprivation Principle__, but deny that they apply to abortion because of some further defeater(s). These further defeaters should be based on principles which themselves cohere with our shared intuitions. I don’t believe that such principles can be provided. Until such principles are provided, this option is also unacceptable.

This can include public advertisement of positions to be filled, active recruitment of qualified applicants from the formerly excluded groups, and special training programs to help them meet the standards for admission or appointment. “Strong” affirmative action refers to “some degree of definite preference for members of these groups in determining access to positions from which they were formerly excluded.” The “weak” vs “strong” distinction has also been referred to as the “minimalist” vs “maximalist” distinction &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.westmont.edu/hoeckley/readings/symposium/PDF/301_400/358.pdf&quot;&gt;(Beauchamp 1998)&lt;/a&gt; or the “procedural” vs “preferential” distinction. As Nagel and Beauchamp note, most people agree that “weak” or “procedural” affirmative action is justified (and perhaps even morally obligatory). However, there is significant controversy regarding “strong” or “preferential” forms of affirmative action. In this post, I will defend “strong or “preferential” affirmative action. Whenever I refer to “affirmative action” for the rest of this post, it will always be in reference to this strong or preferential form. A few clarifications are in order before proceeding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My goal is to defend affirmative action by colleges and universities (as opposed to e.g. employers).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I refer to affirmative action, I will specifically refer to admissions policies that give preferential treatment to underrepresented racial minorities, or URMs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My defense of affirmative action is only intended to defend from charges that affirmative action should be opposed &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it is an unjust form of (racial) discrimination. My defense is agnostic with respect to whether it should be opposed because of other reasons (e.g. because it is ineffective).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m only concerned with affirmative action within the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main arguments commonly invoked to defend affirmative action &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Tierney/publication/249797704_The_Parameters_of_Affirmative_Action_Equity_and_Excellence_in_the_Academy/links/545118e40cf285a067c681f8.pdf&quot;&gt;(Tierney 1997)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;compensatory&lt;/em&gt; argument states that URMs should be granted preferential treatment by colleges and universities to compensate for past or historical discrimination against them or members of their racial group. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://categoricalrigor.wordpress.com/wp-admin/%5Bhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2265014.pdf?seq=1%5D(https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2265014.pdf?seq=1)&quot;&gt;Thompson (1973)&lt;/a&gt; for some compensatory arguments (although her argument focused on the hiring decisions of employers).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt; argument justifies affirmative action based on the benefits of a more racially diverse student body (e.g. the benefit from being exposed to members of different races). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://ojs2.gmu.edu/PPPQ/article/viewFile/1258/1006&quot;&gt;Nagel (1981)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8304057655993507338&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=0,48&quot;&gt;Beauchamp (1998)&lt;/a&gt; for such arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;corrective&lt;/em&gt; argument claims that preference should be given to URMs in order to better select for the most qualified students (e.g. because a Black student’s score on standardized test might be artificially impaired due to disadvantaged schooling, stereotype threat, etc.). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006401619357&quot;&gt;Himma (2001)&lt;/a&gt; for some corrective arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not rely on any of these arguments (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Tierney/publication/249797704_The_Parameters_of_Affirmative_Action_Equity_and_Excellence_in_the_Academy/links/545118e40cf285a067c681f8.pdf&quot;&gt;Tierney (1997)&lt;/a&gt; for objections). Instead, I will provide two separate arguments in defense of affirmative action that are based on principles that I believe almost everyone accepts. The first is an argument based on analogy with preferential treatment to students from low socioeconomic statuses (low-SES students). The second argument is more specific in that it only applies to private universities. This second argument is based on a general “presumption of freedom” that should be granted to all private entities. I’ll now begin with the first argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preferential-treatment-based-on-socioeconomic-status&quot;&gt;Preferential treatment based on socioeconomic status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is based on an analogy between URMs and low-SES students. The basic structure of the argument as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, preferential treatment to URMs is not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note: when I say that X is not an unjust instance of discrimination, what I really mean is that X is not wrong (or bad, or impermissible, or ought to be avoided, etc.) &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it is an unjust instance of discrimination (I use the former wording because it is far more convenient). X may very well be wrong for other reasons, but if it is, it is not &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; wrong by the fact that it is an unjust instance of discrimination. For example, imagine that giving preferential treatment to low-SES students resulted in worse outcomes for those students because they were placed in academic environments in which they lacked the necessary preparation. It is coherent for someone to say that this preferential treatment is bad &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of these negative consequences, but not &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it’s an instance of unjust discrimination. This is because such a person might believe that the treatment would not be bad if the negative consequences were not present. On the other hand, if someone believed that preferential treatment to low-SES students &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an unjust form of discrimination (i.e. it’s wrong &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it’s an unjust form of discrimination), then they might say that such treatment would be bad (or wrong) &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; these negative consequences were not present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe that a substantial defense of premise 1 is needed. Most people believe that universities should grant preferential treatment to low-SES students. A 2016 Gallup poll shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/193508/oppose-colleges-considering-race-admissions.aspx&quot;&gt;61% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; believe that a student’s economic circumstances be a factor in college admissions. Also, a 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyfreepress.com/2018/09/21/americans-favor-diversity-on-college-campuses-according-to-boston-based-poll/&quot;&gt;Boston-based poll&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2018/09/16/wgbh-news-higher-education-poll-top-line-data&quot;&gt;83% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; believe that colleges should consider whether a prospective student has overcome hardships such as poverty or health problems in admissions decisions. Because most people already agree that we should support preferential treatment for students from low-SES backgrounds, I will not bother defending premise 1. Instead, I will be assuming most people’s intuitions are correct here: preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversial premise of the argument is premise 2. My argument for premise 2 will be as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination and if the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, if preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I don’t think the first premise here requires much support. It basically amounts to saying we should treat like cases alike. If two behaviors are equally justified, and if one behavior is not unjust, then the other behavior is also not unjust. I very much doubt anyone rejects this. So the controversy is around the second premise: that the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs. To evaluate this claim, first we must determine what is the justification for preferential treatment to low-SES students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students is the fact that such students are &lt;em&gt;disadvantaged&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, when people object to affirmative action, rarely do they deny that disadvantaged students should be given preferential treatment. Rather, the objection is almost always to propose SES-based preferential treatment as a superior method to account for a student’s disadvantage. Now, the question is whether URMs are also disadvantaged. It seems quite clear to me that they are, and I doubt anyone would seriously deny this (assuming one grants that low-SES students are disadvantaged). Whatever metrics one uses to indicate that low-SES students are disadvantaged (e.g. school quality, single parenthood, income, violent neighborhoods, parental education, etc.) also apply to URMs. However, some people deny that this justifies preferential treatment based on race in a way that is comparable to SES. The only good rationale for treating race and SES differently in this respect is an assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. I will argue that this assumption is actually false, undermining the rationale for treating SES and race differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before proceeding, I would like to note that my argument here is agnostic with respect to the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of the disadvantages faced by low-SES students and URMs. Some posit systemic racism, lack of motivation, lack of role models, cultural deficiencies and others even posit genetic explanations. I offer no &lt;em&gt;causal&lt;/em&gt; explanations of the disadvantages here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s evaluate the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. In order to do this, we must do two things. Firstly, we need to determine what evidence supports the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged. Secondly, we need to determine whether this evidence also exists for URMs &lt;em&gt;after controlling for SES&lt;/em&gt;. If so, we should reject the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firstly, what evidence exists for the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged in the first place? I mentioned factors like school quality, low income, single parenthood, violent neighborhoods, parental education, etc. But why are these characteristics instances of or evidence of &lt;em&gt;disadvantage&lt;/em&gt;? Why not say that wealthy students are disadvantaged because they lack the opportunity to develop the perseverance and “grit” that poor students develop? Whether low-SES or high-SES students are more disadvantaged is an empirical question, so it must be resolved by appeal to empirical evidence. It seems to me that the only good empirical evidence for the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged is the statistical fact that these students tend to score poorly according to traditional admission standards by universities. For example, the fact that low-SES students tend to have poor SAT scores is evidence that these students are relevantly disadvantaged. On the other hand, while there may be some merit to the idea that high-SES students lack “grit” or perseverance, we know that these students are not disadvantaged (in the relevant sense here) because they score relatively well on admissions standards. So the empirical evidence for whether a group is disadvantaged reduces to how well that group performs according to traditional admissions standards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondly, does this evidence also apply to URMs after controlling for SES? That is, is there evidence that URMs perform poorly according to traditional admissions standards &lt;em&gt;after controlling for SES&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is a resounding “Yes”. Consider the following data points.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;URMs perform significantly worse on standardized test scores &lt;em&gt;even after&lt;/em&gt; controlling for SES. For example, most of the Black-White gap in SAT scores remains even after controlling for income. In fact, in 2005, the Black-White gap in SAT scores was 204 points, but the mean SAT score for Whites from families earning less than $10,000 was 129 points higher than the mean SAT score for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Blacks [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Studies find that racial disparities in other measures of cognitive ability do not shrink much even after controlling for SES. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Black-White Test Score Gap&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/9780815746096_chapter1.pdf&quot;&gt;Jencks and Phillips (1998)&lt;/a&gt; measured the scores of Black and White children taking the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The Black children scored about 16 points lower than the White children on these tests. However, the authors report that “a two-year reduction in the black-white education gap among mothers would cut the PPVT gap by about a point” (page 22), “eliminating black-white income differences would cut the PPVT gap by less than 1 point” (page 23) and “children who have grown up in an intact family score no higher on the PPVT than children from single-parent families” (page 23).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So controlling for traditional measures of SES - e.g. income, parental education, family structure, etc. - does not reduce most of the Black-White gap on traditional admissions standards. Thus, we have evidence that the disadvantage experienced by URMs (at least Black students. I assume similar patterns can be found for other URMs) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mostly explained by their low-SES status. But recall that the only good rationale for treating race and SES differently (with respect to preferential treatment by colleges) is an assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. Since this assumption is false, there is no good rationale for treating SES and race differently (with regard to preferential treatment by colleges). The fact that there is no good rationale for treating SES and race differently (with regard to preferential treatment by colleges) suffices to show that premise 2 of my argument is true: if preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. Since I’m assuming premise 1 of my argument is also true - preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination - the conclusion of my argument follows: preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-freedom-to-discriminate&quot;&gt;The freedom to discriminate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other argument for affirmative action is based on a general freedom to discriminate that I believe all private persons and companies should be afforded. The conclusion of my argument here is different from my earlier argument in the following two respects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This argument is limited to &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; universities (governments should not have all of the same freedoms to discriminate that private individuals should have).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This argument only defends the &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; right to discriminate; it is not meant to defend the &lt;em&gt;moral permissibility&lt;/em&gt; of such discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call this the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt;. The basic structure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We ought to grant private entities the legal freedom to discriminate based on any features that they please, except in cases where we are provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict this freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have not been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict a private universities’ freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, we ought to grant private universities the legal freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race (which includes the practice of affirmative action).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burden-of-proof&quot;&gt;Burden of proof&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should emphasize that the first premise does not imply that all instances of discrimination ought to be permitted. The premise only establishes that in a moral dispute concerning whether to legally permit an instance of discrimination, the party in favor of outlawing such discrimination has the “burden of proof” to provide sufficiently strong reasons to deny this freedom. This principle is similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence&quot;&gt;“presumption of innocence”&lt;/a&gt; principle in law. The prosecutor in a criminal case has the burden to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the defendant is guilty. It is not the defendant’s job to prove that they’re innocent. In the absence of sufficient proof from the prosecutor, we should declare the defendant not guilty, i.e. the defendant is “innocent until proven guilty”. Likewise, the first principle of my argument here should be read as a “presumption of freedom”. In the absence of sufficiently strong reasons to deny a private entity the freedom to practice a certain form of discrimination, we ought to legally permit the discrimination. In other words, we should grant private entities a &lt;em&gt;default&lt;/em&gt; freedom to discriminate as they please, which holds unless we are provided with strong reasons to override this default in particular cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like my first argument, it seems to me that the first premise of the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt; does not require much defense. This premise must be accepted for essentially any private corporation to feasibly operate. All employers discriminate between applicants based on skill, knowledge, traits, etc. Universities also discriminate based on academic achievement, intelligence, extra-curricular activities, athletic ability, etc. We need to be given strong reasons before we outlaw a particular form of discrimination, but we do not need strong reasons before we legally permit a particular form of discrimination. Again, I doubt that most people oppose this first premise, so I will not spend more time defending it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controversy, then, concerns the truth of premise 2, i.e. whether we have been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict private universities’ freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race. I will consider a variety of arguments that present the strongest of such reasons (that I’ve seen). In the end, I will argue that all of these arguments fail. None of the proposed reasons meet the “burden of proof” required to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-reasons&quot;&gt;Bad reasons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin by considering some obviously bad reasons in favor of outlawing affirmative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Affirmative action is against the law&lt;/em&gt;. Firstly, this is not even true in all areas. Secondly, and more importantly, this is a straightforwardly fallacious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-the-Law&quot;&gt;appeal to legality&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the law permits or forbids certain conduct does not suggest that such conduct &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be permitted or forbidden. To say otherwise implies that the law should never change, which is absurd. I’m sure I don’t need to list examples of laws that should (or should have been) changed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The public disapproves of affirmative action&lt;/em&gt;. Firstly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/247046/americans-support-affirmative-action-programs-rises.aspx&quot;&gt;it’s not even clear&lt;/a&gt; if this is true. Secondly, this is a fallacious &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum&quot;&gt;appeal to popularity&lt;/a&gt;. Society can be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in their approval or disapproval. To say otherwise implies that society should never change its current norms for approval or disapproval, which is clearly absurd. Again, I need not list examples where society should change (or should have changed) its norms for approval and disapproval. Thirdly, and most importantly, even if society is correct to disapprove of affirmative action, that does not imply that affirmative action should be illegal. For example, society should disapprove of adulterers, but this does not imply that adultery should be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Universities benefit heavily from the government&lt;/em&gt;. The reasoning goes as follows: private universities (and other private institutions) benefit from the government through government-subsidized police protection, military protection, economic regulations, subsidies, etc. which are essential to the institution’s prosperity. Therefore, the government should ban private universities from practicing affirmative action (and from discriminating against a sacred group of “protected classes”). The problem with this is that a similar argument can be used to show that the government is permitted to ban, say, interracial marriage. After all, private &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt; benefit from the government just as much as private companies. Further, surely there are &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; aspects of &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; private entity’s conduct that should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be controlled by the government (e.g. whether a sports apparel store sells basketball jerseys or football jerseys). These examples show that the fact that the government provides substantial benefit to an entity does not tell us &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the government should regulate that entity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Affirmative Action is an instance of racial discrimination&lt;/em&gt;. The problem with this is that there are plenty of instances of racial discrimination that should not be forbidden. For example, casting directors for movies and television shows frequently discriminate prospective actors and actresses based on race. Surely, these instances of racial discrimination should not be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all bad arguments. None of them provide sufficiently strong reasons to deny a university’s general freedom to discriminate. All of them can be shown to lead to absurd conclusions by applying the reasoning to other circumstances. So none of the arguments here meet the “burden of proof” required to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arbitrariness&quot;&gt;Arbitrariness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now someone might respond by saying that affirmative action ought to be opposed because race is an &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt; feature with respect to university admissions. Private universities are only trying to sell a quality education, and the racial makeup of a campus’s student body has no direct influence on the quality of the education of its students. Call this the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; against affirmative action. The argument can be put roughly as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Race is an arbitrary trait of prospective university students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits should be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affirmative action involves discrimination based on the race of prospective students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, affirmative action should be illegal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; seems intuitive. It explains why it seems that racial discrimination should almost always be illegal. The reason is that racial discrimination is almost always arbitrary. Most jobs require you to apply manual labor or process information, which usually has nothing to do with race. But if we imagine cases where race &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a relevant characteristic (e.g. casting for a movie), we see that racial discrimination ought to be legal. This argument can also explain why discrimination seems wrong when it has nothing to do with race. For example, it can explain why it seems wrong for a company to discriminate against a candidate based on, say, blood type, assuming blood type is an arbitrary feature with respect to the position. So it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; that the arbitrariness of an instance of discrimination can meet the “burden of proof” that is demanded by the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt;, we must first clearly define what is meant by “arbitrary”. Let us do so by considering the following scenario. Imagine an employer, Evan, must choose between two candidates for a job, Mark and Lewis. Mark is more qualified than Lewis. However, based on interviews with both candidates, Evan predicts that Lewis, while less qualified, will be considerably more pleasant to be around than Mark because Lewis has a more compatible personality. So Evan decides to hire Lewis over Mark. I don’t think most people believe that Evan’s decision should be legal, so I will not bother defending Evan’s legal right to make this decision. Instead, I will assume that most people’s intuitions here are correct: the preferential treatment by Evan should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be illegal. The question is whether the preferential treatment by Evan is &lt;em&gt;arbitrary&lt;/em&gt;. More specifically, the question is whether the pleasantness of Lewis is an arbitrary trait with respect to his position (using the definition of “arbitrary” as it is used in the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt;). There are two possible answers: either Lewis’s pleasantness &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait, or Lewis’s pleasantness is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait. Either answer, I will argue, implies that the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is unsound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first possible answer is that Lewis’s pleasantness &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait. However, if that is true, then Evan’s choice of Lewis over Mark would be an instance of arbitrary discrimination that should not be illegal (remember, I’m assuming that Evan’s decision should not be illegal here, in line with most people’s intuitions). This means that not all instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits ought to be illegal, which means premise 2 of the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is false, rendering the argument unsound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second possible answer is that Lewis’s pleasantness is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait. The natural response now is to demand an explanation as to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. After all, Lewis was the lesser qualified candidate. What else could we mean by “arbitrary trait” if not a trait that does not influence a candidate’s qualifications?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;One explanation is to say that Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because what makes a trait arbitrary just depends on the preference of the employer. So, on this explanation, if an employer prefers trait X (where X is intelligence, strength, productivity, or even pleasantness), then X is, by definition, not arbitrary. However, this argument implies that no preference by a private entity is ever arbitrary. This means that race is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait of prospective students for universities that practice affirmative action, since such universities clearly prefer that their campuses have a certain racial makeup. This implies that premise 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is false, rendering the argument unsound.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;An alternative explanation is to say that Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because the pleasantness of a company’s employees advances the company’s &lt;em&gt;economic interests&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps more pleasant employees improve the mood of other workers, which in turn promotes employee productivity). Let’s assume this explanation is adequate. However, if we accept this explanation, then race would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. The racial makeup of a university’s campus &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; advance the university’s economic interests. This is because private universities don’t aim to merely sell libraries and lectures, and prospective students do not merely desire libraries and lectures. Universities also aim to offer a college campus with an “atmosphere” that appeals to prospective students. For example, universities commonly promote “racially diverse” campuses to prospective students. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dailyfreepress.com/2018/09/21/americans-favor-diversity-on-college-campuses-according-to-boston-based-poll/&quot;&gt;86% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; believe it is at least somewhat important to strive for an ethnically diverse student body at universities. In other words, students are not just the &lt;em&gt;consumers&lt;/em&gt; of a university; they also play a direct role in creating &lt;em&gt;the product&lt;/em&gt; (in the same way that actors and actresses are related to movies and plays). Thus, if we accept this second explanation for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait (that pleasantness advances the company’s economic interests), then &lt;em&gt;race&lt;/em&gt; is also not an arbitrary trait of prospective university students (because racial diversity advances a university’s economic interests). This implies that premise 1 of the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is false, rendering the argument unsound.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be alternative explanations for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. However, it seems to me that the two explanations that I have considered are the most plausible explanations. If that’s correct, then on the most plausible explanation for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait, the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is unsound. On the other hand, as I argued earlier, if Lewis’s pleasantness &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an arbitrary trait, then the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; would still be unsound. Thus, we should conclude that the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is unsound. Since the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; is unsound, it obviously fails to meet the burden presented by the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt; that I gave earlier. The “arbitrariness” of an instance of discrimination does not constitute sufficiently strong reason to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a small aside: if this still seems unintuitive, consider the fact that many universities already practice a similar form of discrimination in the form of sex-based discrimination. The most extreme form of discrimination of this kind comes from women’s colleges and men’s colleges, universities that only allow students of a certain sex. Many other colleges also perform sex-based discrimination for the opposite goal, to maintain a roughly even male:female ratio on campus. Most do not believe that such institutions should be outlawed. The reason is that the sexual makeup of the student campus is clearly an essential part of the product that these colleges wish to sell, which means the sex of the students is not arbitrary. I see no reason to treat race-based discrimination (i.e. affirmative action) any differently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deprivation&quot;&gt;Deprivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section, I argued that the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt; fails because affirmative action is not arbitrary because the racial makeup of a university’s campus is relevant to the university’s economic goals. In actuality, I don’t believe that arbitrariness matters at all. Even if race is a completely arbitrary trait of prospective students, private universities should still be permitted to practice affirmative action. Why should a private entity not be permitted to discriminate on arbitrary grounds? After all, these entities are (and should be) permitted to make all kinds of arbitrary decisions. For example, a sports apparel store’s decision to sell basketball versus football sportswear, a baker’s decision to sell strawberry versus chocolate cake, a restaurants decision to offer hamburgers versus tacos, etc. could very well be arbitrary decisions. Assuming these are all arbitrary decisions, should they be outlawed? Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes arbitrary decisions regarding &lt;em&gt;discrimination&lt;/em&gt; special? Why treat this differently than the countless other arbitrary decisions that companies make? I believe the answer is that discrimination can cause the perpetual deprivation of disenfranchised (usually minority) populations. If there is rampant discrimination against a particular group, then this can leave the group without adequate access to vital resources such as healthcare, education, occupation, housing, etc. In fact, I believe that our strong intuitions against discrimination (especially racial discrimination) are explained by a subconscious association between discrimination and deprivation due to the troubled history of minorities (particularly Black people) in America. If not for this troubled history, I believe we would not treat arbitrary discrimination any differently than any other arbitrary decision that companies constantly make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually agree with the importance of deprivation with regard to discrimination. In fact, I believe that the fact that an instance of discrimination can cause rampant deprivation meets the “burden of proof” demanded by the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt;. Avoiding immense suffering to a particular group certainly constitutes sufficiently strong reason to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate. This suggests that there isn’t anything inherently problematic about arbitrary discrimination that warrants outlawing it. Rather, it’s the association with systemic deprivation that matters. This suggests a standard that must be met to justify outlawing a particular form of discrimination, namely whether that form of discrimination will likely result in immense deprivation for a particular group. If forms of discrimination deprive certain groups of vital resources, then such discrimination should be restricted (regardless of whether the discrimination is arbitrary). For example, many instances of discrimination against the handicapped are clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; arbitrary (since such discrimination might advance a company’s interests), but we are justified in restricting some of these instances of discrimination because the consequences for the handicapped can be dire otherwise. On the other hand, if forms of discrimination do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; deprive anyone of vital resources, then such discrimination should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be restricted (regardless of whether the discrimination is arbitrary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this standard, it seems quite clear to me that affirmative action by private universities &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be legal. The students who are rejected admission to universities due to affirmative action almost certainly will not experience immense deprivation as a result. This is because most colleges are not very selective. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/09/a-majority-of-u-s-colleges-admit-most-students-who-apply/&quot;&gt;most colleges admit most of their applicants&lt;/a&gt;. So the students who are rejected admissions due to affirmative action are primarily students who were rejected by fairly elite universities. These students - i.e. those who &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have been accepted into an elite university if not for affirmative action - overwhelmingly come from upper- and upper-middle-class households and overwhelmingly experience comparable economic success in their adulthood. These rejected students usually resort to attending either a different elite university or a slightly less selective university. If there is any systemic, aggregate “harm” to these students, it is relatively minor, e.g. instead of rising to the &lt;em&gt;upper-uppe_r-middle class as adults, they “merely” rise to the _upper&lt;/em&gt;-middle-class. This “harm” does not meet the “burden of proof” demanded by the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that fairly wealthy students are made slightly less wealthy due to affirmative action is not sufficiently strong reason to override a private university’s default freedom to discriminate as they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-burden-is-not-met&quot;&gt;The burden is not met&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to recap the points made in this argument. First, I presented my &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt; in defense of affirmative action, which maintains that a “burden of proof” must be satisfied by those who endorse restricting a private entity’s legal freedom to discriminate as they please. We need to be provided with sufficiently strong reason to override this default freedom. Next, I considered some straightforwardly bad arguments that fail to meet this burden, e.g. arguments based on public opinion or arguments that prohibit &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; instances of racial discrimination. Then I considered the &lt;em&gt;Arbitrariness Argument&lt;/em&gt;, but concluded that it is unsound and therefore fails to meet the “burden of proof”. Lastly, I admitted that the systemic deprivation &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; meet the burden presented by the &lt;em&gt;Freedom Argument&lt;/em&gt;, but objected that affirmative action does not cause such deprivation. Therefore, none of the arguments considered thus far provide sufficiently strong reason to deny private universities the legal freedom to practice affirmative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, someone could imagine &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; arguments that attempt to present sufficiently strong reason to outlaw affirmative action. I cannot currently prove that all such future arguments will fail. However, I believe that the arguments that I considered here are the strongest arguments against the legalization of affirmative action (at least to my knowledge). So, while I cannot prove that all future arguments against affirmative action fail, I think the failure of the strongest arguments presented thus far provides strong inductive reason to believe that any future arguments will likewise fail. Regardless, until we are presented with such arguments and we are shown that they provide sufficiently strong reason to outlaw affirmative action (i.e. sound arguments that do not lead to absurd consequences), private universities should be legally permitted to practice affirmative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concludes my defense of affirmative action. Recall from my introduction that this was a “defense” in a fairly limited sense. My goal here was merely to show that affirmative action is not an unjust form of discrimination. If affirmative action ought to be opposed, it is not &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it’s an unjust form of discrimination. However, affirmative action may very well be worth opposing for other reasons. For example, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/10/the-painful-truth-about-affirmative-action/263122/&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; regarding whether URMs are actually harmed by affirmative action because of “mismatch theory”, which is the idea that affirmative action beneficiaries are placed into academic environments that teach “above” their ability or preparedness. I make no claims about whether affirmative action ought to be opposed on these grounds. The purpose of this post was merely to argue that affirmative action should not be opposed on the grounds that it is an unjust form of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Thomas Nagel (1981) distinguishes between two forms of affirmative action. “Weak” affirmative action refers to “to special efforts to ensure equal opportunity for members of groups that had been subject to discrimination”. This can include public advertisement of positions to be filled, active recruitment of qualified applicants from the formerly excluded groups, and special training programs to help them meet the standards for admission or appointment. “Strong” affirmative action refers to “some degree of definite preference for members of these groups in determining access to positions from which they were formerly excluded.” The “weak” vs “strong” distinction has also been referred to as the “minimalist” vs “maximalist” distinction (Beauchamp 1998) or the “procedural” vs “preferential” distinction. As Nagel and Beauchamp note, most people agree that “weak” or “procedural” affirmative action is justified (and perhaps even morally obligatory). However, there is significant controversy regarding “strong” or “preferential” forms of affirmative action. In this post, I will defend “strong or “preferential” affirmative action. Whenever I refer to “affirmative action” for the rest of this post, it will always be in reference to this strong or preferential form. A few clarifications are in order before proceeding: My goal is to defend affirmative action by colleges and universities (as opposed to e.g. employers). When I refer to affirmative action, I will specifically refer to admissions policies that give preferential treatment to underrepresented racial minorities, or URMs. My defense of affirmative action is only intended to defend from charges that affirmative action should be opposed because it is an unjust form of (racial) discrimination. My defense is agnostic with respect to whether it should be opposed because of other reasons (e.g. because it is ineffective). I’m only concerned with affirmative action within the United States. There are three main arguments commonly invoked to defend affirmative action (Tierney 1997): The compensatory argument states that URMs should be granted preferential treatment by colleges and universities to compensate for past or historical discrimination against them or members of their racial group. See Thompson (1973) for some compensatory arguments (although her argument focused on the hiring decisions of employers). The diversity argument justifies affirmative action based on the benefits of a more racially diverse student body (e.g. the benefit from being exposed to members of different races). See Nagel (1981) and Beauchamp (1998) for such arguments. The corrective argument claims that preference should be given to URMs in order to better select for the most qualified students (e.g. because a Black student’s score on standardized test might be artificially impaired due to disadvantaged schooling, stereotype threat, etc.). See Himma (2001) for some corrective arguments. I will not rely on any of these arguments (see Tierney (1997) for objections). Instead, I will provide two separate arguments in defense of affirmative action that are based on principles that I believe almost everyone accepts. The first is an argument based on analogy with preferential treatment to students from low socioeconomic statuses (low-SES students). The second argument is more specific in that it only applies to private universities. This second argument is based on a general “presumption of freedom” that should be granted to all private entities. I’ll now begin with the first argument. Preferential treatment based on socioeconomic status This argument is based on an analogy between URMs and low-SES students. The basic structure of the argument as follows: Preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination. If preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. Therefore, preferential treatment to URMs is not an instance of unjust discrimination. Note: when I say that X is not an unjust instance of discrimination, what I really mean is that X is not wrong (or bad, or impermissible, or ought to be avoided, etc.) because it is an unjust instance of discrimination (I use the former wording because it is far more convenient). X may very well be wrong for other reasons, but if it is, it is not made wrong by the fact that it is an unjust instance of discrimination. For example, imagine that giving preferential treatment to low-SES students resulted in worse outcomes for those students because they were placed in academic environments in which they lacked the necessary preparation. It is coherent for someone to say that this preferential treatment is bad because of these negative consequences, but not because it’s an instance of unjust discrimination. This is because such a person might believe that the treatment would not be bad if the negative consequences were not present. On the other hand, if someone believed that preferential treatment to low-SES students was an unjust form of discrimination (i.e. it’s wrong because it’s an unjust form of discrimination), then they might say that such treatment would be bad (or wrong) even if these negative consequences were not present. I do not believe that a substantial defense of premise 1 is needed. Most people believe that universities should grant preferential treatment to low-SES students. A 2016 Gallup poll shows that 61% of Americans believe that a student’s economic circumstances be a factor in college admissions. Also, a 2018 Boston-based poll found that 83% of Americans believe that colleges should consider whether a prospective student has overcome hardships such as poverty or health problems in admissions decisions. Because most people already agree that we should support preferential treatment for students from low-SES backgrounds, I will not bother defending premise 1. Instead, I will be assuming most people’s intuitions are correct here: preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination. The controversial premise of the argument is premise 2. My argument for premise 2 will be as follows. If preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination and if the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. The justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs. Therefore, if preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. Again, I don’t think the first premise here requires much support. It basically amounts to saying we should treat like cases alike. If two behaviors are equally justified, and if one behavior is not unjust, then the other behavior is also not unjust. I very much doubt anyone rejects this. So the controversy is around the second premise: that the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students also applies to URMs. To evaluate this claim, first we must determine what is the justification for preferential treatment to low-SES students. It seems to me that the justification of preferential treatment to low-SES students is the fact that such students are disadvantaged. In fact, when people object to affirmative action, rarely do they deny that disadvantaged students should be given preferential treatment. Rather, the objection is almost always to propose SES-based preferential treatment as a superior method to account for a student’s disadvantage. Now, the question is whether URMs are also disadvantaged. It seems quite clear to me that they are, and I doubt anyone would seriously deny this (assuming one grants that low-SES students are disadvantaged). Whatever metrics one uses to indicate that low-SES students are disadvantaged (e.g. school quality, single parenthood, income, violent neighborhoods, parental education, etc.) also apply to URMs. However, some people deny that this justifies preferential treatment based on race in a way that is comparable to SES. The only good rationale for treating race and SES differently in this respect is an assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. I will argue that this assumption is actually false, undermining the rationale for treating SES and race differently. Before proceeding, I would like to note that my argument here is agnostic with respect to the cause of the disadvantages faced by low-SES students and URMs. Some posit systemic racism, lack of motivation, lack of role models, cultural deficiencies and others even posit genetic explanations. I offer no causal explanations of the disadvantages here. Now, let’s evaluate the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. In order to do this, we must do two things. Firstly, we need to determine what evidence supports the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged. Secondly, we need to determine whether this evidence also exists for URMs after controlling for SES. If so, we should reject the assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. Firstly, what evidence exists for the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged in the first place? I mentioned factors like school quality, low income, single parenthood, violent neighborhoods, parental education, etc. But why are these characteristics instances of or evidence of disadvantage? Why not say that wealthy students are disadvantaged because they lack the opportunity to develop the perseverance and “grit” that poor students develop? Whether low-SES or high-SES students are more disadvantaged is an empirical question, so it must be resolved by appeal to empirical evidence. It seems to me that the only good empirical evidence for the claim that low-SES students are disadvantaged is the statistical fact that these students tend to score poorly according to traditional admission standards by universities. For example, the fact that low-SES students tend to have poor SAT scores is evidence that these students are relevantly disadvantaged. On the other hand, while there may be some merit to the idea that high-SES students lack “grit” or perseverance, we know that these students are not disadvantaged (in the relevant sense here) because they score relatively well on admissions standards. So the empirical evidence for whether a group is disadvantaged reduces to how well that group performs according to traditional admissions standards. Secondly, does this evidence also apply to URMs after controlling for SES? That is, is there evidence that URMs perform poorly according to traditional admissions standards after controlling for SES? The answer is a resounding “Yes”. Consider the following data points. URMs perform significantly worse on standardized test scores even after controlling for SES. For example, most of the Black-White gap in SAT scores remains even after controlling for income. In fact, in 2005, the Black-White gap in SAT scores was 204 points, but the mean SAT score for Whites from families earning less than $10,000 was 129 points higher than the mean SAT score for all Blacks [source]. Studies find that racial disparities in other measures of cognitive ability do not shrink much even after controlling for SES. For example, in The Black-White Test Score Gap, Jencks and Phillips (1998) measured the scores of Black and White children taking the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The Black children scored about 16 points lower than the White children on these tests. However, the authors report that “a two-year reduction in the black-white education gap among mothers would cut the PPVT gap by about a point” (page 22), “eliminating black-white income differences would cut the PPVT gap by less than 1 point” (page 23) and “children who have grown up in an intact family score no higher on the PPVT than children from single-parent families” (page 23). So controlling for traditional measures of SES - e.g. income, parental education, family structure, etc. - does not reduce most of the Black-White gap on traditional admissions standards. Thus, we have evidence that the disadvantage experienced by URMs (at least Black students. I assume similar patterns can be found for other URMs) is not mostly explained by their low-SES status. But recall that the only good rationale for treating race and SES differently (with respect to preferential treatment by colleges) is an assumption that the disadvantage faced by URMs is mostly explained by their low-SES status. Since this assumption is false, there is no good rationale for treating SES and race differently (with regard to preferential treatment by colleges). The fact that there is no good rationale for treating SES and race differently (with regard to preferential treatment by colleges) suffices to show that premise 2 of my argument is true: if preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination, then preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. Since I’m assuming premise 1 of my argument is also true - preferential treatment to low-SES students is not an instance of unjust discrimination - the conclusion of my argument follows: preferential treatment to URMs is also not an instance of unjust discrimination. The freedom to discriminate My other argument for affirmative action is based on a general freedom to discriminate that I believe all private persons and companies should be afforded. The conclusion of my argument here is different from my earlier argument in the following two respects: This argument is limited to private universities (governments should not have all of the same freedoms to discriminate that private individuals should have). This argument only defends the legal right to discriminate; it is not meant to defend the moral permissibility of such discrimination. Call this the Freedom Argument. The basic structure is as follows: We ought to grant private entities the legal freedom to discriminate based on any features that they please, except in cases where we are provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict this freedom. We have not been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict a private universities’ freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race. Therefore, we ought to grant private universities the legal freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race (which includes the practice of affirmative action). Burden of proof I should emphasize that the first premise does not imply that all instances of discrimination ought to be permitted. The premise only establishes that in a moral dispute concerning whether to legally permit an instance of discrimination, the party in favor of outlawing such discrimination has the “burden of proof” to provide sufficiently strong reasons to deny this freedom. This principle is similar to the “presumption of innocence” principle in law. The prosecutor in a criminal case has the burden to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the defendant is guilty. It is not the defendant’s job to prove that they’re innocent. In the absence of sufficient proof from the prosecutor, we should declare the defendant not guilty, i.e. the defendant is “innocent until proven guilty”. Likewise, the first principle of my argument here should be read as a “presumption of freedom”. In the absence of sufficiently strong reasons to deny a private entity the freedom to practice a certain form of discrimination, we ought to legally permit the discrimination. In other words, we should grant private entities a default freedom to discriminate as they please, which holds unless we are provided with strong reasons to override this default in particular cases. Like my first argument, it seems to me that the first premise of the Freedom Argument does not require much defense. This premise must be accepted for essentially any private corporation to feasibly operate. All employers discriminate between applicants based on skill, knowledge, traits, etc. Universities also discriminate based on academic achievement, intelligence, extra-curricular activities, athletic ability, etc. We need to be given strong reasons before we outlaw a particular form of discrimination, but we do not need strong reasons before we legally permit a particular form of discrimination. Again, I doubt that most people oppose this first premise, so I will not spend more time defending it. The controversy, then, concerns the truth of premise 2, i.e. whether we have been provided with sufficiently strong reason to restrict private universities’ freedom to discriminate prospective students based on race. I will consider a variety of arguments that present the strongest of such reasons (that I’ve seen). In the end, I will argue that all of these arguments fail. None of the proposed reasons meet the “burden of proof” required to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please. Bad reasons Let’s begin by considering some obviously bad reasons in favor of outlawing affirmative action. Affirmative action is against the law. Firstly, this is not even true in all areas. Secondly, and more importantly, this is a straightforwardly fallacious appeal to legality. The fact that the law permits or forbids certain conduct does not suggest that such conduct should be permitted or forbidden. To say otherwise implies that the law should never change, which is absurd. I’m sure I don’t need to list examples of laws that should (or should have been) changed. The public disapproves of affirmative action. Firstly, it’s not even clear if this is true. Secondly, this is a fallacious appeal to popularity. Society can be wrong in their approval or disapproval. To say otherwise implies that society should never change its current norms for approval or disapproval, which is clearly absurd. Again, I need not list examples where society should change (or should have changed) its norms for approval and disapproval. Thirdly, and most importantly, even if society is correct to disapprove of affirmative action, that does not imply that affirmative action should be illegal. For example, society should disapprove of adulterers, but this does not imply that adultery should be illegal. Universities benefit heavily from the government. The reasoning goes as follows: private universities (and other private institutions) benefit from the government through government-subsidized police protection, military protection, economic regulations, subsidies, etc. which are essential to the institution’s prosperity. Therefore, the government should ban private universities from practicing affirmative action (and from discriminating against a sacred group of “protected classes”). The problem with this is that a similar argument can be used to show that the government is permitted to ban, say, interracial marriage. After all, private individuals benefit from the government just as much as private companies. Further, surely there are some aspects of some private entity’s conduct that should not be controlled by the government (e.g. whether a sports apparel store sells basketball jerseys or football jerseys). These examples show that the fact that the government provides substantial benefit to an entity does not tell us how the government should regulate that entity. Affirmative Action is an instance of racial discrimination. The problem with this is that there are plenty of instances of racial discrimination that should not be forbidden. For example, casting directors for movies and television shows frequently discriminate prospective actors and actresses based on race. Surely, these instances of racial discrimination should not be illegal. These are all bad arguments. None of them provide sufficiently strong reasons to deny a university’s general freedom to discriminate. All of them can be shown to lead to absurd conclusions by applying the reasoning to other circumstances. So none of the arguments here meet the “burden of proof” required to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please. Arbitrariness Now someone might respond by saying that affirmative action ought to be opposed because race is an arbitrary feature with respect to university admissions. Private universities are only trying to sell a quality education, and the racial makeup of a campus’s student body has no direct influence on the quality of the education of its students. Call this the Arbitrariness Argument against affirmative action. The argument can be put roughly as follows. Race is an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. All instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits should be illegal. Affirmative action involves discrimination based on the race of prospective students. Therefore, affirmative action should be illegal. The Arbitrariness Argument seems intuitive. It explains why it seems that racial discrimination should almost always be illegal. The reason is that racial discrimination is almost always arbitrary. Most jobs require you to apply manual labor or process information, which usually has nothing to do with race. But if we imagine cases where race is a relevant characteristic (e.g. casting for a movie), we see that racial discrimination ought to be legal. This argument can also explain why discrimination seems wrong when it has nothing to do with race. For example, it can explain why it seems wrong for a company to discriminate against a candidate based on, say, blood type, assuming blood type is an arbitrary feature with respect to the position. So it seems that the arbitrariness of an instance of discrimination can meet the “burden of proof” that is demanded by the Freedom Argument. To address the Arbitrariness Argument, we must first clearly define what is meant by “arbitrary”. Let us do so by considering the following scenario. Imagine an employer, Evan, must choose between two candidates for a job, Mark and Lewis. Mark is more qualified than Lewis. However, based on interviews with both candidates, Evan predicts that Lewis, while less qualified, will be considerably more pleasant to be around than Mark because Lewis has a more compatible personality. So Evan decides to hire Lewis over Mark. I don’t think most people believe that Evan’s decision should be legal, so I will not bother defending Evan’s legal right to make this decision. Instead, I will assume that most people’s intuitions here are correct: the preferential treatment by Evan should not be illegal. The question is whether the preferential treatment by Evan is arbitrary. More specifically, the question is whether the pleasantness of Lewis is an arbitrary trait with respect to his position (using the definition of “arbitrary” as it is used in the Arbitrariness Argument). There are two possible answers: either Lewis’s pleasantness is an arbitrary trait, or Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. Either answer, I will argue, implies that the Arbitrariness Argument is unsound. The first possible answer is that Lewis’s pleasantness is an arbitrary trait. However, if that is true, then Evan’s choice of Lewis over Mark would be an instance of arbitrary discrimination that should not be illegal (remember, I’m assuming that Evan’s decision should not be illegal here, in line with most people’s intuitions). This means that not all instances of discrimination based on arbitrary traits ought to be illegal, which means premise 2 of the Arbitrariness Argument is false, rendering the argument unsound. The second possible answer is that Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. The natural response now is to demand an explanation as to why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. After all, Lewis was the lesser qualified candidate. What else could we mean by “arbitrary trait” if not a trait that does not influence a candidate’s qualifications? One explanation is to say that Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because what makes a trait arbitrary just depends on the preference of the employer. So, on this explanation, if an employer prefers trait X (where X is intelligence, strength, productivity, or even pleasantness), then X is, by definition, not arbitrary. However, this argument implies that no preference by a private entity is ever arbitrary. This means that race is not an arbitrary trait of prospective students for universities that practice affirmative action, since such universities clearly prefer that their campuses have a certain racial makeup. This implies that premise 1 of the Arbitrariness Argument is false, rendering the argument unsound. An alternative explanation is to say that Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait because the pleasantness of a company’s employees advances the company’s economic interests (perhaps more pleasant employees improve the mood of other workers, which in turn promotes employee productivity). Let’s assume this explanation is adequate. However, if we accept this explanation, then race would not be an arbitrary trait of prospective university students. The racial makeup of a university’s campus does advance the university’s economic interests. This is because private universities don’t aim to merely sell libraries and lectures, and prospective students do not merely desire libraries and lectures. Universities also aim to offer a college campus with an “atmosphere” that appeals to prospective students. For example, universities commonly promote “racially diverse” campuses to prospective students. In fact, 86% of Americans believe it is at least somewhat important to strive for an ethnically diverse student body at universities. In other words, students are not just the consumers of a university; they also play a direct role in creating the product (in the same way that actors and actresses are related to movies and plays). Thus, if we accept this second explanation for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait (that pleasantness advances the company’s economic interests), then race is also not an arbitrary trait of prospective university students (because racial diversity advances a university’s economic interests). This implies that premise 1 of the Arbitrariness Argument is false, rendering the argument unsound. There may be alternative explanations for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait. However, it seems to me that the two explanations that I have considered are the most plausible explanations. If that’s correct, then on the most plausible explanation for why Lewis’s pleasantness is not an arbitrary trait, the Arbitrariness Argument is unsound. On the other hand, as I argued earlier, if Lewis’s pleasantness is an arbitrary trait, then the Arbitrariness Argument would still be unsound. Thus, we should conclude that the Arbitrariness Argument is unsound. Since the Arbitrariness Argument is unsound, it obviously fails to meet the burden presented by the Freedom Argument that I gave earlier. The “arbitrariness” of an instance of discrimination does not constitute sufficiently strong reason to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate as they please. As a small aside: if this still seems unintuitive, consider the fact that many universities already practice a similar form of discrimination in the form of sex-based discrimination. The most extreme form of discrimination of this kind comes from women’s colleges and men’s colleges, universities that only allow students of a certain sex. Many other colleges also perform sex-based discrimination for the opposite goal, to maintain a roughly even male:female ratio on campus. Most do not believe that such institutions should be outlawed. The reason is that the sexual makeup of the student campus is clearly an essential part of the product that these colleges wish to sell, which means the sex of the students is not arbitrary. I see no reason to treat race-based discrimination (i.e. affirmative action) any differently. Deprivation In the previous section, I argued that the Arbitrariness Argument fails because affirmative action is not arbitrary because the racial makeup of a university’s campus is relevant to the university’s economic goals. In actuality, I don’t believe that arbitrariness matters at all. Even if race is a completely arbitrary trait of prospective students, private universities should still be permitted to practice affirmative action. Why should a private entity not be permitted to discriminate on arbitrary grounds? After all, these entities are (and should be) permitted to make all kinds of arbitrary decisions. For example, a sports apparel store’s decision to sell basketball versus football sportswear, a baker’s decision to sell strawberry versus chocolate cake, a restaurants decision to offer hamburgers versus tacos, etc. could very well be arbitrary decisions. Assuming these are all arbitrary decisions, should they be outlawed? Of course not. So what makes arbitrary decisions regarding discrimination special? Why treat this differently than the countless other arbitrary decisions that companies make? I believe the answer is that discrimination can cause the perpetual deprivation of disenfranchised (usually minority) populations. If there is rampant discrimination against a particular group, then this can leave the group without adequate access to vital resources such as healthcare, education, occupation, housing, etc. In fact, I believe that our strong intuitions against discrimination (especially racial discrimination) are explained by a subconscious association between discrimination and deprivation due to the troubled history of minorities (particularly Black people) in America. If not for this troubled history, I believe we would not treat arbitrary discrimination any differently than any other arbitrary decision that companies constantly make. I actually agree with the importance of deprivation with regard to discrimination. In fact, I believe that the fact that an instance of discrimination can cause rampant deprivation meets the “burden of proof” demanded by the Freedom Argument. Avoiding immense suffering to a particular group certainly constitutes sufficiently strong reason to override a private entity’s default freedom to discriminate. This suggests that there isn’t anything inherently problematic about arbitrary discrimination that warrants outlawing it. Rather, it’s the association with systemic deprivation that matters. This suggests a standard that must be met to justify outlawing a particular form of discrimination, namely whether that form of discrimination will likely result in immense deprivation for a particular group. If forms of discrimination deprive certain groups of vital resources, then such discrimination should be restricted (regardless of whether the discrimination is arbitrary). For example, many instances of discrimination against the handicapped are clearly not arbitrary (since such discrimination might advance a company’s interests), but we are justified in restricting some of these instances of discrimination because the consequences for the handicapped can be dire otherwise. On the other hand, if forms of discrimination do not deprive anyone of vital resources, then such discrimination should not be restricted (regardless of whether the discrimination is arbitrary). Using this standard, it seems quite clear to me that affirmative action by private universities should be legal. The students who are rejected admission to universities due to affirmative action almost certainly will not experience immense deprivation as a result. This is because most colleges are not very selective. In fact, most colleges admit most of their applicants. So the students who are rejected admissions due to affirmative action are primarily students who were rejected by fairly elite universities. These students - i.e. those who would have been accepted into an elite university if not for affirmative action - overwhelmingly come from upper- and upper-middle-class households and overwhelmingly experience comparable economic success in their adulthood. These rejected students usually resort to attending either a different elite university or a slightly less selective university. If there is any systemic, aggregate “harm” to these students, it is relatively minor, e.g. instead of rising to the upper-uppe_r-middle class as adults, they “merely” rise to the _upper-middle-class. This “harm” does not meet the “burden of proof” demanded by the Freedom Argument. The fact that fairly wealthy students are made slightly less wealthy due to affirmative action is not sufficiently strong reason to override a private university’s default freedom to discriminate as they please. The burden is not met Allow me to recap the points made in this argument. First, I presented my Freedom Argument in defense of affirmative action, which maintains that a “burden of proof” must be satisfied by those who endorse restricting a private entity’s legal freedom to discriminate as they please. We need to be provided with sufficiently strong reason to override this default freedom. Next, I considered some straightforwardly bad arguments that fail to meet this burden, e.g. arguments based on public opinion or arguments that prohibit all instances of racial discrimination. Then I considered the Arbitrariness Argument, but concluded that it is unsound and therefore fails to meet the “burden of proof”. Lastly, I admitted that the systemic deprivation does meet the burden presented by the Freedom Argument, but objected that affirmative action does not cause such deprivation. Therefore, none of the arguments considered thus far provide sufficiently strong reason to deny private universities the legal freedom to practice affirmative action. Of course, someone could imagine other arguments that attempt to present sufficiently strong reason to outlaw affirmative action. I cannot currently prove that all such future arguments will fail. However, I believe that the arguments that I considered here are the strongest arguments against the legalization of affirmative action (at least to my knowledge). So, while I cannot prove that all future arguments against affirmative action fail, I think the failure of the strongest arguments presented thus far provides strong inductive reason to believe that any future arguments will likewise fail. Regardless, until we are presented with such arguments and we are shown that they provide sufficiently strong reason to outlaw affirmative action (i.e. sound arguments that do not lead to absurd consequences), private universities should be legally permitted to practice affirmative action. Conclusion This concludes my defense of affirmative action. Recall from my introduction that this was a “defense” in a fairly limited sense. My goal here was merely to show that affirmative action is not an unjust form of discrimination. If affirmative action ought to be opposed, it is not because it’s an unjust form of discrimination. However, affirmative action may very well be worth opposing for other reasons. For example, there is controversy regarding whether URMs are actually harmed by affirmative action because of “mismatch theory”, which is the idea that affirmative action beneficiaries are placed into academic environments that teach “above” their ability or preparedness. I make no claims about whether affirmative action ought to be opposed on these grounds. The purpose of this post was merely to argue that affirmative action should not be opposed on the grounds that it is an unjust form of discrimination.

The purpose of this post is to argue against normative skepticism, which I define as the rejection of normative reasons. Thus, I will argue in this post that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; normative reasons. I begin by describing in more detail the nature of normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-normative-reasons&quot;&gt;What are normative reasons?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the central concept of normativity is the concept of a normative &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;. I will be assuming in this post what Thomas Scanlon calls “Reasons Fundamentalism”, which he describes as the view that “truths about reasons are not reducible to or identifiable with non-normative truths” (in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore-moral/#2&quot;&gt;G.E. Moore&lt;/a&gt; believed that “good” is a “simple” and “unanalyzable” concept) and possibly also the view that reasons are “the only fundamental elements of the normative domain” (page 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199678488.001.0001/acprof-9780199678488&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being Realistic about Reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

However, my assumption of reasons fundamentalism is not essential to any of the arguments that I present below. I mention my assumption of reasons fundamentalism only to explain why the post is primarily concerned with “reasons” over other normative concepts. All of my arguments can be reformulated without losing substance with an alternative normative concept instead of “reasons”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a normative reason? I believe we are all implicitly familiar with the concept of a normative reason, so the best way to illuminate the concept may be to consider some examples. One type of normative reason concerns reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/#NormReas&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; reasons&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a reason is said to be a “normative reason” for acting because it favours someone’s acting. But what does it mean to say that a reason “favours” an action? One way of understanding this claim is in terms of justification: a reason justifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This is why normative reasons are also called “justifying” reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; aren’t the only kind of normative reasons. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Metaphysics of Reasons”&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20170918220343/https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] Jonas Olson gives examples of other kinds of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We talk about normative reasons when we say, for example, that there were no reasons to invade Iraq in 2003; when we say that there is reason to stay sober the night before a fi­nal exam; or when we say that there are reasons to believe that the universe is billions of years old. We can say that the first kind of normative reason is moral, the second pruden­tial, and the third epistemic”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passage lists examples of reasons for two kinds of attitudes - epistemic reasons as reasons for &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt;, and moral and prudential reasons as reasons for &lt;em&gt;actions&lt;/em&gt; (an action can be understood as an &lt;em&gt;intention&lt;/em&gt;, which is a kind of attitude). But beliefs and actions aren’t the only kinds of attitudes for which there can be reasons. There are also reasons to desire, admire, appreciate, and fear things. I believe that the class of attitudes for which there can be reasons is what Thomas Scanlon calls “judgment sensitive attitudes” in Chapter 1 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/SCAWWO&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What We Owe to Each Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The class of attitudes for which reasons in the sense I have in mind can sensibly be asked for or offered can be characterized, with apparent but I think innocent circularity, as the class of “judgment-sensitive attitudes.” These are attitudes that an ideally rational person would come to have whenever that person judged there to be sufficient reasons for them and that would, in an ideally rational person, “extinguish” when that person judged them not to be supported by reasons of the appropriate kind. Hunger is obviously not a judgment-sensitive attitude; but belief is, and so are fear, anger, admiration, respect, and other evaluative attitudes such as the view that fame is worth seeking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; can be reasons? I will accept the consensus view that &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/&quot;&gt;“normative reasons are facts”&lt;/a&gt; (for simplicity, I assume that a “fact” is simply a true proposition). Claims about normative reasons are generally taken to be relational claims involving at least three entities: a fact, an agent, and an attitude. For example, a claim about normative reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; “establishes a relation between a fact, an agent, and an action kind” such that the &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt; provides the &lt;em&gt;agent&lt;/em&gt; reason to perform the &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;. This can be understood as the three-place “reason relation” (I borrow this terminology from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf&quot;&gt;Jonas Olson&lt;/a&gt;, page 4). Normative reasons generally (as opposed to reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; specifically) establish the “reason relation” between a fact, an agent, and an &lt;em&gt;attitude&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the fact that &lt;em&gt;Adam will enjoy reading this book&lt;/em&gt; (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to intend (the attitude) to read that book. For another example, the fact that &lt;em&gt;Bob entered the building wearing a raincoat drenched in water&lt;/em&gt; (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to believe (the attitude) that it is raining outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; reasons are distinct from &lt;em&gt;motivating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; reasons. The latter kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the “reason &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;” an agent did or will do something. The former kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the “reason &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;” do something. For example, imagine that John is hungry and is presented with poisonous food which he doesn’t know is poisonous. On the one hand, if he eats the food, we can posit an &lt;em&gt;explanatory&lt;/em&gt; reason for why he ate the food; the reason &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; John ate the food consists in the fact that he was hungry and he believed the food was not poisonous. This would be an answer to the question “Why &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; John eat the food?” On the other hand, we can also posit a &lt;em&gt;normative&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;justifying&lt;/em&gt; reason to not eat the food; the reason &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; not eat the food consists in the fact that it is poisonous (combined with the fact that John probably doesn’t want to be poisoned). This would be an answer to the question “Why &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; John eat or not eat the food?” See this &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-just-vs-expl/#NormReas&quot;&gt;SEP article&lt;/a&gt; for more on the distinction between motivating/explanatory reasons and normative/justifying reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, note that what is important here is the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of a reason, not the &lt;em&gt;term&lt;/em&gt; “reason”. The term “reason” is merely a linguistic device that English speakers have constructed to express the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt;. But there is nothing inherently special about this term. Just as rocks would exist if we hadn’t invented the term “rock”, so too would we have reasons (to adopt certain attitudes) if we hadn’t invented the term “reason”. To see why, consider the fact that non-English speakers clearly have terms to refer to reasons, so such speakers must use different terms to express the same concept that “reason” expresses in English. Further, the concept of a reason can be expressed using other synonymous terms within English. For example, when one says “A has decisive reason to do X” (where X = adopting an attitude, a desire, a belief, etc.), this can also be interpreted as “A &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to do X”, “it is &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; for A to do X”, “A is &lt;em&gt;warranted&lt;/em&gt; in doing X”, “A is &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; in doing X”, “it &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;/em&gt; for A to do X”, etc. All of these statements express (more or less) the same idea using different terms. What’s special about normative concepts lies not in any particular terminology. I prefer to use the term “reason”, but the same concept can be referred to with any alternative normative term so long as its grammatical form can accommodate the three-place “reason relation” that I described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I must state that my argument is agnostic with respect to the &lt;em&gt;ontological&lt;/em&gt; status of reasons and normativity. I say nothing about whether normative concepts (such as normative reasons) refer to non-natural entities (e.g. as &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/CUNTNW&quot;&gt;Terrence Cuneo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2607202&quot;&gt;David Enoch&lt;/a&gt; argue) or natural entities (e.g. as &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/SMITMP&quot;&gt;Michael Smith&lt;/a&gt; argues), whether normative truth should be given a constructivist analysis (e.g. as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nakulkrishna.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sharon-street-what-is-constructivism.pdf&quot;&gt;Sharon Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/k/korsgaard94.pdf&quot;&gt;Christine Korsgaard&lt;/a&gt; argue) or a robust realist analysis, and/or whether normative judgments should be given a non-cognitivist analysis (e.g. as &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/62456/Gibbard2002_The_Reasons_of_a_Living_Being.pdf;sequence=1&quot;&gt;Allan Gibbard&lt;/a&gt; argues) or cognitivist analysis. I personally accept a combination of some form of constructivism and non-cognitivism, but that is beyond the scope of this post. My only claim in this post is that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; normative reasons. See Jonas Olson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.philosophy.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.207423.1413734464!/menu/standard/file/MetaphysReasonsOHRN%20Final.pdf&quot;&gt;“The Metaphysics of Reasons”&lt;/a&gt; for a good review of different ontological views regarding normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ubiquity-of-normative-reasons&quot;&gt;The ubiquity of normative reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that nature of normative reasons has been clarified, I would like to stress the fact that normative judgments are found in every aspect of our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All philosophers engage with the concept of normative reasons in some capacity, particularly epistemic normative reasons. Epistemic normative reasons (also called &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; normative reasons) are different from normative reasons generally in that epistemic normative reasons are concerned with reasons for &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt;, whereas, say, practical normative reasons are concerned with reasons for &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every philosopher advances a claim about epistemic reasons when they present an &lt;em&gt;argument&lt;/em&gt; for a claim. Arguments provide premises that &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; their conclusions. This is usually done by providing premises that provide &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to believe the conclusion of the argument by appeal to some (often implicit) inference rule (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens&quot;&gt;modus ponens&lt;/a&gt;). There are different valid inference rules depending on the mode of reasoning being employed. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning&quot;&gt;deductive reasoning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-inductive/&quot;&gt;inductive reasoning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/&quot;&gt;abductive reasoning&lt;/a&gt; use different inference rules that dictate how a conclusion can be reached from a set of premises. Other philosophical debates are more explicitly concerned with disputes about epistemic reasons. For example, questions about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-analysis/&quot;&gt;analysis of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, about theories of knowledge (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/&quot;&gt;foundationalism&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/&quot;&gt;coherentism&lt;/a&gt;), about the proper methods for establishing knowledge (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/&quot;&gt;empiricist vs rationalist&lt;/a&gt;), etc. are best seen as disputes about &lt;em&gt;epistemic justification&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. disputes about what we have &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to believe. Questions of these kinds have significance in all areas of philosophy since all philosophers (even the most ardent skeptics) are interested in determining what we are justified in believing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more practical example of the importance of epistemic reasons, consider an epistemic guide that almost everyone accepts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/#OckhRazo&quot;&gt;Occam’s Razor&lt;/a&gt;. Occam’s Razor is best formulated as a thesis about our epistemic reasons. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/#Int&quot;&gt;SEP article on simplicity&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200618183518/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] gives the following formulation of Occam’s Razor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If theory T is simpler than theory T&lt;em&gt;, then it is rational (other things being equal) to believe T rather than T&lt;/em&gt;. Or it may be formulated as a methodological principle: if T is simpler than T* then it is rational to adopt T as one’s working theory for scientific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean for it to be &lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; to believe T rather than T&lt;em&gt;? Of course it means something like, there is more _epistemic reason_ to believe T rather than T&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar remarks can be said about every dispute in philosophy. All parties in debates regarding the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/&quot;&gt;determinism&lt;/a&gt;, the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/&quot;&gt;free will&lt;/a&gt;, the truth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/&quot;&gt;compatibilism&lt;/a&gt;, the truth of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/&quot;&gt;skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, the existence of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/&quot;&gt;external reality&lt;/a&gt;, etc. believe that there is more (epistemic) reason in favor of their particular side of the debate. Even skeptics of an area believe that we have more reason to be skeptical than we have to assume knowledge in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These points demonstrate that philosophers are deeply concerned with forming &lt;em&gt;normative judgments&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. judgments about normative reasons. We also find ample examples of normative judgments in ordinary people. For example, when you ask someone why they hold the beliefs that they hold, they usually explain their beliefs by appeal to (what they consider to be) &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; for their beliefs. But what is “evidence”? Evidence is &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/#EviWhiJusBel&quot;&gt;that which justifies belief&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200702100349/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evidence/&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;]. But &lt;em&gt;justified belief&lt;/em&gt; is synonymous with beliefs that there is &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to hold. For another example, almost everyone agrees that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is round than there is that the Earth is flat. But even flat-Earthers must believe that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is flat. Either way, virtually everyone accepts that there is more evidence in favor of certain beliefs over others. In other words, virtually everyone accepts normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-against-normative-skepticism&quot;&gt;Arguments against normative skepticism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the nature and ubiquity of normative reasons have been illustrated, I will now provide arguments against normative skepticism, i.e. arguments that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-deliberative-agents-are-committed-to-there-being-normative-reasons&quot;&gt;All deliberative agents are committed to there being normative reasons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first argument will emphasize an earlier point about the ubiquity of normative judgments. Earlier, I noted that normative judgments are made by virtually everyone, including both philosophers and ordinary people. However, the ubiquity of normative judgments is deeper than that. The capacity and disposition to form normative judgments are &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; to our nature &lt;em&gt;insofar as we are deliberative beings&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/k/korsgaard94.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sources of Normativity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20190810030439/https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/k/korsgaard94.pdf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] (pages 78-79), Christine Korsgaard stresses this point when she notes that humans, unlike many lower animals, do not merely form beliefs based on our immediate perceptions or form intentions based on our immediate desires. As “essentially reflective” creatures, we are capable of thinking &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; our perceptions, desires, beliefs, intentions, and other thoughts. This capacity to “back up” from our attitudes sets up what Korsgaard calls “the problem of the normative”, which is the problem of determining which attitudes we &lt;em&gt;endorse&lt;/em&gt; (which may differ from the attitudes we currently hold). In other words, the capacity for self-reflection sets up the “normative problem”, i.e. the problem of determining what attitudes we have &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to hold. &lt;em&gt;Deliberation&lt;/em&gt; is the process of attempting to address the normative problem. This is a process of determining what to do, what to believe, and how to feel; and these determinations are based on our judgments about the &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; that we have for or against possible attitudes that we can form. Therefore, all rational agents, insofar as they are deliberative, are essentially committed to the judgment that there are &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; in favor of certain beliefs, intentions, or feelings. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2607202&quot;&gt;“An Outline of an Argument for Robust Metanormative Realism”&lt;/a&gt;, David Enoch raises a similar point when he argues that “in deliberating, you commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation” (page 38).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, one might object that our commitment to normative reasons does not entail that there &lt;em&gt;really are&lt;/em&gt; normative reasons. This is technically true. However, I still believe that exposing this commitment constitutes is a good argument for normative reasons. I believe this because I believe that arguments are largely a discursive device. Specifically, the primary purpose of an argument (I believe) is to rationally persuade an interlocutor to accept a claim that they do not already accept (this is similar to what has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://iep.utm.edu/argument/#H2&quot;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as the “pragmatic approach” to characterizing arguments). Now, one argumentative strategy to achieve this purpose is to provide &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; to accept the claim. However, this kind of strategy would be question-begging for the claim that I wish to demonstrate (that normative skepticism is unreasonable) because my hypothetical interlocutor does not accept the existence of reasons. Instead, another argumentative strategy is to show that my hypothetical interlocutor is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; committed to the claim (whether they know it or not). That’s exactly what I’ve done here as I’ve explained that all agents, insofar as they are deliberative, are committed to normative reasons. Therefore, my interlocutor, insofar as they are deliberative, is also committed to there being normative reasons, and this is sufficient to ground a solid argument in favor of normative reasons, i.e. it is sufficient to rationally persuade someone to accept that there are normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to further emphasize the ubiquity of deliberation. We form &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of our beliefs without any deliberation. Consider perceptions as an example. When a person with healthy sight is presented with a red ball before him, this will be accompanied by a variety of beliefs, e.g. they will come to believe that they are perceiving a red ball and they will come to believe that there is a red ball before them. These beliefs are not the result of any form of deliberation (e.g. no one thinks to themselves “I am receiving certain visual stimuli…Therefore, I perceive a red ball in front of me…Therefore, there is a red ball before me”). Deliberation is absent for many of these trivial beliefs which are produced immediately by perception. On the other hand, all of our nontrivial beliefs are formed by some process of deliberation. For example, when we make predictions about the future, we employ inductive reasoning. When we practice mathematics or logic, we employ deductive reasoning. When we attempt to explain a set of observations using inference to the best explanation, we employ abductive reasoning. These forms of reasoning all employ &lt;em&gt;deliberation&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, deliberation underlies all of our nontrivial beliefs, and (as argued above) deliberation is essentially committed to the judgment that are normative reasons. Therefore, behind all of our nontrivial beliefs is an (often implicit) commitment that there are normative reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was said about beliefs can also be said about other attitudes such as desires and intentions. For example, while some of our intentions are produced immediately without any deliberation (e.g. intentions due to nonvoluntary impulses or habits), many of our intentions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; produced by deliberation (specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/practical-reason/&quot;&gt;practical reasoning&lt;/a&gt;). The same applies to desires and the other “judgment-sensitive attitudes” that I characterized earlier. Thus, I believe this argument supports normative reasons for actions, desires, and other “judgment-sensitive attitudes” just as much as it supports normative reasons for beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-argument-from-justified-beliefs&quot;&gt;The argument from justified beliefs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is largely borrowed from Richard Rowland’s paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/78d1/d6dcf0f56dbbf8394c4d114f50121419ad13.pdf&quot;&gt;“Moral Error Theory and the Argument from Epistemic Reasons”&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20200606183140/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/78d1/d6dcf0f56dbbf8394c4d114f50121419ad13.pdf&quot;&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;] (page 14):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If normative skepticism is true, then there are no normative reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some beliefs are justified.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order for a belief to be justified, there must be some normative reasons to hold the belief.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, there are normative reasons (from 2 and 3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, normative skepticism is false (from 1 and 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most controversial premise here is premise 2, but I think it can be shown to be true rather easily. This can be shown by merely listing some examples of justified beliefs that all sane persons accept (some of these are taken from the Rowland paper linked earlier): I am justified in believing that I do not know everything, that I am thinking, that I am having certain experiences and feelings right now, that I perceive myself to be currently typing on a keyboard, that certain logical and mathematical propositions are true (e.g. 1+1 = 2), etc. Every sane person must concede that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of these beliefs are justified. But even this minor concession is sufficient to demonstrate that there are normative reasons, for justified belief requires that there are normative &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; in favor of the belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;normative-skepticism-is-self-defeating&quot;&gt;Normative skepticism is self-defeating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last argument will show that normative skepticism is self-defeating. This is done by showing that if normative skepticism is true, then it necessarily follows that it is unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assume normative skepticism is true.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order for a position to be justified, there must be some normative reasons to believe the position.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, there are no normative reasons to believe anything (from 1).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Therefore, normative skepticism is unjustified (from 2 and 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, even if normative skepticism is true, it would be unjustified. But propositions that would be unjustified if true are unreasonable. For example, consider the proposition “All propositions are unjustified”. This proposition is clearly unreasonable, since it would be unjustified if true. Normative skepticism is just a more general form of this proposition, since it states that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; (propositions, theories, positions, beliefs, actions, intentions, etc.) is unjustified (since there are no reasons in favor of anything). Therefore, normative skepticism is unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrence Cuneo provides a similar argument in his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/rec/CUNTNW&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Normative Web: An Argument for Moral Realism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suffices to show that normative skepticism, i.e. that there are no normative reasons, is unreasonable. I provided three arguments against normative skepticism: I argued that all deliberative agents are committed to there being normative reasons, that we have some justified beliefs, and that normative skepticism is self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting implication of my argument here is that (I believe) it also suffices to demonstrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-instrumental/#KanHypImp&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;categorical&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to &lt;em&gt;hypothetical&lt;/em&gt;) normative reasons, i.e. normative reasons which are not contingent on an agent’s ends or interests. The reason for this is that the arguments that I have given here primarily demonstrate that there are &lt;em&gt;epistemic&lt;/em&gt; reasons (i.e. reasons for belief), which of course do not depend on an agent’s ends or interests (surely, whether an agent’s belief is justified or whether there is evidence for an agent’s belief does not depend on that agent’s ends or interests. Consider the fact that an agent’s ends or interests might be best served by having &lt;em&gt;unjustified&lt;/em&gt; beliefs. For example, a theist’s belief in God might advance his interests - e.g. it might make him happier - regardless of whether the belief was justified). This has some implications on debates in other areas of philosophy. For example, one argument for &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; skepticism in particular (as opposed to normative skepticism in general) rests on the assumption that categorical practical reasons, which morality purports to issue, are implausible. Now, I have only argued for categorical &lt;em&gt;epistemic&lt;/em&gt; (instead of &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt;) reasons in my post here, so I have not directly addressed this particular argument for moral skepticism. However, I believe my argument here &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lend &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; credence to the existence of categorical practical reasons (since it shows that there are categorical normative reasons in general). I do, in fact, believe that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; categorical practical reasons, but a full defense demands a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Normativity is concerned with what we ought to do, how the world ought to be, what we have reason to do, what is good/bad, right/wrong, what is justified/unjustified, warranted/unwarranted, etc. Normative claims can be contrasted with descriptive claims as the latter are concerned with how the world actually is (or has been or will be) whereas the former are concerned with how the world should be. The purpose of this post is to argue against normative skepticism, which I define as the rejection of normative reasons. Thus, I will argue in this post that there are normative reasons. I begin by describing in more detail the nature of normative reasons. What are normative reasons? I believe that the central concept of normativity is the concept of a normative reason. I will be assuming in this post what Thomas Scanlon calls “Reasons Fundamentalism”, which he describes as the view that “truths about reasons are not reducible to or identifiable with non-normative truths” (in the same way that G.E. Moore believed that “good” is a “simple” and “unanalyzable” concept) and possibly also the view that reasons are “the only fundamental elements of the normative domain” (page 2 of Being Realistic about Reasons). This is a thesis shared by many prominent philosophers [archived] such as Derek Parfit and (as just mentioned) Thomas Scanlon, although some philosophers disagree, such as Ralph Wedgwood [archived] and John Broome [archived]. However, my assumption of reasons fundamentalism is not essential to any of the arguments that I present below. I mention my assumption of reasons fundamentalism only to explain why the post is primarily concerned with “reasons” over other normative concepts. All of my arguments can be reformulated without losing substance with an alternative normative concept instead of “reasons”. What is a normative reason? I believe we are all implicitly familiar with the concept of a normative reason, so the best way to illuminate the concept may be to consider some examples. One type of normative reason concerns reasons for action (or practical reasons): a reason is said to be a “normative reason” for acting because it favours someone’s acting. But what does it mean to say that a reason “favours” an action? One way of understanding this claim is in terms of justification: a reason justifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This is why normative reasons are also called “justifying” reasons. Reasons for action aren’t the only kind of normative reasons. In “The Metaphysics of Reasons” [archived] Jonas Olson gives examples of other kinds of reasons: We talk about normative reasons when we say, for example, that there were no reasons to invade Iraq in 2003; when we say that there is reason to stay sober the night before a fi­nal exam; or when we say that there are reasons to believe that the universe is billions of years old. We can say that the first kind of normative reason is moral, the second pruden­tial, and the third epistemic” This passage lists examples of reasons for two kinds of attitudes - epistemic reasons as reasons for beliefs, and moral and prudential reasons as reasons for actions (an action can be understood as an intention, which is a kind of attitude). But beliefs and actions aren’t the only kinds of attitudes for which there can be reasons. There are also reasons to desire, admire, appreciate, and fear things. I believe that the class of attitudes for which there can be reasons is what Thomas Scanlon calls “judgment sensitive attitudes” in Chapter 1 of What We Owe to Each Other: The class of attitudes for which reasons in the sense I have in mind can sensibly be asked for or offered can be characterized, with apparent but I think innocent circularity, as the class of “judgment-sensitive attitudes.” These are attitudes that an ideally rational person would come to have whenever that person judged there to be sufficient reasons for them and that would, in an ideally rational person, “extinguish” when that person judged them not to be supported by reasons of the appropriate kind. Hunger is obviously not a judgment-sensitive attitude; but belief is, and so are fear, anger, admiration, respect, and other evaluative attitudes such as the view that fame is worth seeking What kinds of things can be reasons? I will accept the consensus view that “normative reasons are facts” (for simplicity, I assume that a “fact” is simply a true proposition). Claims about normative reasons are generally taken to be relational claims involving at least three entities: a fact, an agent, and an attitude. For example, a claim about normative reasons for action “establishes a relation between a fact, an agent, and an action kind” such that the fact provides the agent reason to perform the action. This can be understood as the three-place “reason relation” (I borrow this terminology from Jonas Olson, page 4). Normative reasons generally (as opposed to reasons for action specifically) establish the “reason relation” between a fact, an agent, and an attitude. For example, the fact that Adam will enjoy reading this book (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to intend (the attitude) to read that book. For another example, the fact that Bob entered the building wearing a raincoat drenched in water (the fact) is a reason for Adam (the agent) to believe (the attitude) that it is raining outside. It is important to note that normative reasons are distinct from motivating or explanatory reasons. The latter kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the “reason that” an agent did or will do something. The former kinds of reasons are often referred to by saying the “reason to” do something. For example, imagine that John is hungry and is presented with poisonous food which he doesn’t know is poisonous. On the one hand, if he eats the food, we can posit an explanatory reason for why he ate the food; the reason that John ate the food consists in the fact that he was hungry and he believed the food was not poisonous. This would be an answer to the question “Why did John eat the food?” On the other hand, we can also posit a normative or justifying reason to not eat the food; the reason to not eat the food consists in the fact that it is poisonous (combined with the fact that John probably doesn’t want to be poisoned). This would be an answer to the question “Why should John eat or not eat the food?” See this SEP article for more on the distinction between motivating/explanatory reasons and normative/justifying reasons. Also, note that what is important here is the concept of a reason, not the term “reason”. The term “reason” is merely a linguistic device that English speakers have constructed to express the concept. But there is nothing inherently special about this term. Just as rocks would exist if we hadn’t invented the term “rock”, so too would we have reasons (to adopt certain attitudes) if we hadn’t invented the term “reason”. To see why, consider the fact that non-English speakers clearly have terms to refer to reasons, so such speakers must use different terms to express the same concept that “reason” expresses in English. Further, the concept of a reason can be expressed using other synonymous terms within English. For example, when one says “A has decisive reason to do X” (where X = adopting an attitude, a desire, a belief, etc.), this can also be interpreted as “A ought to do X”, “it is rational for A to do X”, “A is warranted in doing X”, “A is justified in doing X”, “it makes sense for A to do X”, etc. All of these statements express (more or less) the same idea using different terms. What’s special about normative concepts lies not in any particular terminology. I prefer to use the term “reason”, but the same concept can be referred to with any alternative normative term so long as its grammatical form can accommodate the three-place “reason relation” that I described earlier. Finally, I must state that my argument is agnostic with respect to the ontological status of reasons and normativity. I say nothing about whether normative concepts (such as normative reasons) refer to non-natural entities (e.g. as Terrence Cuneo and David Enoch argue) or natural entities (e.g. as Michael Smith argues), whether normative truth should be given a constructivist analysis (e.g. as Sharon Street and Christine Korsgaard argue) or a robust realist analysis, and/or whether normative judgments should be given a non-cognitivist analysis (e.g. as Allan Gibbard argues) or cognitivist analysis. I personally accept a combination of some form of constructivism and non-cognitivism, but that is beyond the scope of this post. My only claim in this post is that there are normative reasons. See Jonas Olson’s “The Metaphysics of Reasons” for a good review of different ontological views regarding normative reasons. The ubiquity of normative reasons Now that nature of normative reasons has been clarified, I would like to stress the fact that normative judgments are found in every aspect of our thinking. All philosophers engage with the concept of normative reasons in some capacity, particularly epistemic normative reasons. Epistemic normative reasons (also called theoretical normative reasons) are different from normative reasons generally in that epistemic normative reasons are concerned with reasons for belief, whereas, say, practical normative reasons are concerned with reasons for action. Every philosopher advances a claim about epistemic reasons when they present an argument for a claim. Arguments provide premises that support their conclusions. This is usually done by providing premises that provide reason to believe the conclusion of the argument by appeal to some (often implicit) inference rule (e.g. modus ponens). There are different valid inference rules depending on the mode of reasoning being employed. For example, deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning use different inference rules that dictate how a conclusion can be reached from a set of premises. Other philosophical debates are more explicitly concerned with disputes about epistemic reasons. For example, questions about the analysis of knowledge, about theories of knowledge (e.g. foundationalism vs coherentism), about the proper methods for establishing knowledge (e.g. empiricist vs rationalist), etc. are best seen as disputes about epistemic justification, i.e. disputes about what we have reason to believe. Questions of these kinds have significance in all areas of philosophy since all philosophers (even the most ardent skeptics) are interested in determining what we are justified in believing. For a more practical example of the importance of epistemic reasons, consider an epistemic guide that almost everyone accepts: Occam’s Razor. Occam’s Razor is best formulated as a thesis about our epistemic reasons. For example, the SEP article on simplicity [archived] gives the following formulation of Occam’s Razor: If theory T is simpler than theory T, then it is rational (other things being equal) to believe T rather than T. Or it may be formulated as a methodological principle: if T is simpler than T* then it is rational to adopt T as one’s working theory for scientific purposes. But what does it mean for it to be rational to believe T rather than T? Of course it means something like, there is more _epistemic reason_ to believe T rather than T. Similar remarks can be said about every dispute in philosophy. All parties in debates regarding the existence of determinism, the existence of free will, the truth of compatibilism, the truth of skepticism, the existence of external reality, etc. believe that there is more (epistemic) reason in favor of their particular side of the debate. Even skeptics of an area believe that we have more reason to be skeptical than we have to assume knowledge in that area. These points demonstrate that philosophers are deeply concerned with forming normative judgments, i.e. judgments about normative reasons. We also find ample examples of normative judgments in ordinary people. For example, when you ask someone why they hold the beliefs that they hold, they usually explain their beliefs by appeal to (what they consider to be) evidence for their beliefs. But what is “evidence”? Evidence is that which justifies belief [archived]. But justified belief is synonymous with beliefs that there is reason to hold. For another example, almost everyone agrees that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is round than there is that the Earth is flat. But even flat-Earthers must believe that there is more evidence (i.e. more normative reason to believe) that the Earth is flat. Either way, virtually everyone accepts that there is more evidence in favor of certain beliefs over others. In other words, virtually everyone accepts normative reasons. Arguments against normative skepticism Now that the nature and ubiquity of normative reasons have been illustrated, I will now provide arguments against normative skepticism, i.e. arguments that there are normative reasons. All deliberative agents are committed to there being normative reasons My first argument will emphasize an earlier point about the ubiquity of normative judgments. Earlier, I noted that normative judgments are made by virtually everyone, including both philosophers and ordinary people. However, the ubiquity of normative judgments is deeper than that. The capacity and disposition to form normative judgments are essential to our nature insofar as we are deliberative beings. In The Sources of Normativity [archived] (pages 78-79), Christine Korsgaard stresses this point when she notes that humans, unlike many lower animals, do not merely form beliefs based on our immediate perceptions or form intentions based on our immediate desires. As “essentially reflective” creatures, we are capable of thinking about our perceptions, desires, beliefs, intentions, and other thoughts. This capacity to “back up” from our attitudes sets up what Korsgaard calls “the problem of the normative”, which is the problem of determining which attitudes we endorse (which may differ from the attitudes we currently hold). In other words, the capacity for self-reflection sets up the “normative problem”, i.e. the problem of determining what attitudes we have reason to hold. Deliberation is the process of attempting to address the normative problem. This is a process of determining what to do, what to believe, and how to feel; and these determinations are based on our judgments about the reasons that we have for or against possible attitudes that we can form. Therefore, all rational agents, insofar as they are deliberative, are essentially committed to the judgment that there are reasons in favor of certain beliefs, intentions, or feelings. In “An Outline of an Argument for Robust Metanormative Realism”, David Enoch raises a similar point when he argues that “in deliberating, you commit yourself to there being (normative) reasons relevant to your deliberation” (page 38). Now, one might object that our commitment to normative reasons does not entail that there really are normative reasons. This is technically true. However, I still believe that exposing this commitment constitutes is a good argument for normative reasons. I believe this because I believe that arguments are largely a discursive device. Specifically, the primary purpose of an argument (I believe) is to rationally persuade an interlocutor to accept a claim that they do not already accept (this is similar to what has been described as the “pragmatic approach” to characterizing arguments). Now, one argumentative strategy to achieve this purpose is to provide reasons to accept the claim. However, this kind of strategy would be question-begging for the claim that I wish to demonstrate (that normative skepticism is unreasonable) because my hypothetical interlocutor does not accept the existence of reasons. Instead, another argumentative strategy is to show that my hypothetical interlocutor is already committed to the claim (whether they know it or not). That’s exactly what I’ve done here as I’ve explained that all agents, insofar as they are deliberative, are committed to normative reasons. Therefore, my interlocutor, insofar as they are deliberative, is also committed to there being normative reasons, and this is sufficient to ground a solid argument in favor of normative reasons, i.e. it is sufficient to rationally persuade someone to accept that there are normative reasons. I want to further emphasize the ubiquity of deliberation. We form some of our beliefs without any deliberation. Consider perceptions as an example. When a person with healthy sight is presented with a red ball before him, this will be accompanied by a variety of beliefs, e.g. they will come to believe that they are perceiving a red ball and they will come to believe that there is a red ball before them. These beliefs are not the result of any form of deliberation (e.g. no one thinks to themselves “I am receiving certain visual stimuli…Therefore, I perceive a red ball in front of me…Therefore, there is a red ball before me”). Deliberation is absent for many of these trivial beliefs which are produced immediately by perception. On the other hand, all of our nontrivial beliefs are formed by some process of deliberation. For example, when we make predictions about the future, we employ inductive reasoning. When we practice mathematics or logic, we employ deductive reasoning. When we attempt to explain a set of observations using inference to the best explanation, we employ abductive reasoning. These forms of reasoning all employ deliberation. In other words, deliberation underlies all of our nontrivial beliefs, and (as argued above) deliberation is essentially committed to the judgment that are normative reasons. Therefore, behind all of our nontrivial beliefs is an (often implicit) commitment that there are normative reasons. What was said about beliefs can also be said about other attitudes such as desires and intentions. For example, while some of our intentions are produced immediately without any deliberation (e.g. intentions due to nonvoluntary impulses or habits), many of our intentions are produced by deliberation (specifically, practical reasoning). The same applies to desires and the other “judgment-sensitive attitudes” that I characterized earlier. Thus, I believe this argument supports normative reasons for actions, desires, and other “judgment-sensitive attitudes” just as much as it supports normative reasons for beliefs. The argument from justified beliefs This argument is largely borrowed from Richard Rowland’s paper “Moral Error Theory and the Argument from Epistemic Reasons” [archived] (page 14): If normative skepticism is true, then there are no normative reasons. Some beliefs are justified. In order for a belief to be justified, there must be some normative reasons to hold the belief. Therefore, there are normative reasons (from 2 and 3). Therefore, normative skepticism is false (from 1 and 4). The most controversial premise here is premise 2, but I think it can be shown to be true rather easily. This can be shown by merely listing some examples of justified beliefs that all sane persons accept (some of these are taken from the Rowland paper linked earlier): I am justified in believing that I do not know everything, that I am thinking, that I am having certain experiences and feelings right now, that I perceive myself to be currently typing on a keyboard, that certain logical and mathematical propositions are true (e.g. 1+1 = 2), etc. Every sane person must concede that some of these beliefs are justified. But even this minor concession is sufficient to demonstrate that there are normative reasons, for justified belief requires that there are normative reasons in favor of the belief. Normative skepticism is self-defeating My last argument will show that normative skepticism is self-defeating. This is done by showing that if normative skepticism is true, then it necessarily follows that it is unjustified. Assume normative skepticism is true. In order for a position to be justified, there must be some normative reasons to believe the position. Therefore, there are no normative reasons to believe anything (from 1). Therefore, normative skepticism is unjustified (from 2 and 3). Thus, even if normative skepticism is true, it would be unjustified. But propositions that would be unjustified if true are unreasonable. For example, consider the proposition “All propositions are unjustified”. This proposition is clearly unreasonable, since it would be unjustified if true. Normative skepticism is just a more general form of this proposition, since it states that everything (propositions, theories, positions, beliefs, actions, intentions, etc.) is unjustified (since there are no reasons in favor of anything). Therefore, normative skepticism is unreasonable. Terrence Cuneo provides a similar argument in his book The Normative Web: An Argument for Moral Realism. Conclusion This suffices to show that normative skepticism, i.e. that there are no normative reasons, is unreasonable. I provided three arguments against normative skepticism: I argued that all deliberative agents are committed to there being normative reasons, that we have some justified beliefs, and that normative skepticism is self-defeating. An interesting implication of my argument here is that (I believe) it also suffices to demonstrate categorical (as opposed to hypothetical) normative reasons, i.e. normative reasons which are not contingent on an agent’s ends or interests. The reason for this is that the arguments that I have given here primarily demonstrate that there are epistemic reasons (i.e. reasons for belief), which of course do not depend on an agent’s ends or interests (surely, whether an agent’s belief is justified or whether there is evidence for an agent’s belief does not depend on that agent’s ends or interests. Consider the fact that an agent’s ends or interests might be best served by having unjustified beliefs. For example, a theist’s belief in God might advance his interests - e.g. it might make him happier - regardless of whether the belief was justified). This has some implications on debates in other areas of philosophy. For example, one argument for moral skepticism in particular (as opposed to normative skepticism in general) rests on the assumption that categorical practical reasons, which morality purports to issue, are implausible. Now, I have only argued for categorical epistemic (instead of practical) reasons in my post here, so I have not directly addressed this particular argument for moral skepticism. However, I believe my argument here does lend some credence to the existence of categorical practical reasons (since it shows that there are categorical normative reasons in general). I do, in fact, believe that there are categorical practical reasons, but a full defense demands a separate post.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A sketch of plausible libertarian ownership rights</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Ownership-Rights.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A sketch of plausible libertarian ownership rights" /><published>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Ownership%20Rights</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Ownership-Rights.html">&lt;p&gt;I will describe in this post what I take to be a plausible form of libertarian ownership rights. This post is meant as an exercise to &lt;em&gt;formulate&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;justify&lt;/em&gt;, my preferred form of libertarianism. I will occasionally provide some justifications for my positions on various issues, but they must be brief (otherwise the post would never end!). This exercise allows me to clarify and connect a wide range of my political opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start by illuminating what most libertarians take to be the core of libertarianism: self-ownership. I will describe the nature of self-ownership and explain why it is not a mysterious or implausible concept. Next, I discuss world-ownership, which concerns the ownership of non-persons. Here, I describe my theory of private property and describe cases where resources ought to be treated as common property rather than private property. Finally, I will consider questions related to the indeterminacy and defeasibility of ownership rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#self-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self-ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most libertarians, myself included, ground their theory in &lt;em&gt;self-ownership&lt;/em&gt; (some libertarians attempt to ground their theory in something like the &lt;em&gt;non-aggression principle&lt;/em&gt;, but there are many serious problems with this kind of view as &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2772753&quot;&gt;Zwolinski (2016)&lt;/a&gt; has described). In this section, I will describe the nature of self-ownership and explain why it is not a mysterious or implausible concept. To show that self-ownership is not mysterious, I will describe the nature of moral rights and enumerate some of the rights associated with self-ownership. To show that self-ownership is not implausible, I will show how the vast majority of people (including libertarians, liberals, and even socialists) appeal to self-ownership (or something close to self-ownership) to explain many of the rights they find important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ownership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When libertarians speak of “ownership”, they are not speaking about what people &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; own. Libertarianism is not a legal theory. Some people might take this to be metaphysically mysterious. After all, what does it mean to say that someone &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; an entity above and beyond what the law specifies? It might seem that the rejection of a &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; sense of ownership commits one to a queer and implausible &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; sense of ownership, based on some weird metaphysical relation between a person and the entity that they own. But libertarianism is not committed to such metaphysical claims about ownership. Libertarianism is only committed to &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; claims about ownership. When libertarians claim that a person owns an entity, this only necessitates a &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; relation between the person, the entity, and other persons. That moral relation consists in a “bundle of rights” associated with the entity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/OTSUKAM/leftlibP&amp;amp;PA.pdf&quot;&gt;Vallentyne et al (2005)&lt;/a&gt; (page 204) described the “bundle of rights” associated with ownership as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Full private ownership of an object consists of a full set of the following ownership rights: (1) control rights over the use of the object; (2) rights to compensation if someone uses the object without one’s permission; (3) enforcement rights (to prevent the violation of these rights or to extract compensation owed for past violation); (4) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan); and (5) immunity to the nonconsensual loss of any of the rights of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was said about “ownership” above can also be said about “rights” here. Rights should not be understood as &lt;em&gt;legal&lt;/em&gt; rights. Libertarianism is not concerned with interpreting legal rights. Libertarianism is concerned with &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; rights. Just like the idea of “ownership”, someone might object to the idea of “moral rights” due to an assumption that the idea involves mysterious &lt;em&gt;metaphysical&lt;/em&gt; claims about the existence of said rights. After all, there are no rights found in nature independent of human construction. But, also like the idea of “ownership”, the invocation of moral rights does not commit one to any metaphysical claims. To say that a person has certain moral rights is merely to assert a set of moral claims. More specifically, to ascribe to a person a certain moral right is to make claims about what they are morally permitted to do and what others are morally prohibited from doing. Surely, there is nothing metaphysical mysterious about saying that people are morally permitted to perform or prohibited from performing certain actions. Following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#AnalRigh&quot;&gt;SEP article on rights&lt;/a&gt;, most rights consist of some combination of some number of four basic components (which are called “Hohfeldian incidents”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Privileges (or liberties): &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has a privilege to φ &lt;em&gt;if and only if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has no duty not to φ.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Claims: &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has a claim that &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; φ &lt;em&gt;if and only if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; has a duty to &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; to φ.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Powers: &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has a power &lt;em&gt;if and only if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; has the ability to alter her own or another’s Hohfeldian incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immunities: &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; has an immunity &lt;em&gt;if and only if&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; lacks the ability to alter &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;’s Hohfeldian incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you have the right to pick up a shell you find on the beach, this right would be a &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt; (or liberty) to pick up the shell (i.e. you have no moral duty to not pick up the shell). If you have the right to privacy, then this right would be a &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; on others (i.e. others have a moral duty to not intrude on your privacy). Some rights can be understood as either privileges or claims. For example, a right to food might be understood as a &lt;em&gt;privilege&lt;/em&gt; to acquire food or a &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt; that others subsidize or refrain from interfering with one’s acquisition of food. From my perspective, all moral rights involve &lt;em&gt;claims&lt;/em&gt; (within the context of political philosophy), and I will be operating from this perspective for the rest of the post. For an example of a &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt;, consider when someone sells a house. Initially, when the person owns the house, they have the privilege to use the house and they have a claim that others not use the house with their consent. However, if they sell the house to someone else, then this will &lt;em&gt;transfer&lt;/em&gt; these liberties and claims to the other person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-ownership-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#self-ownership-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self-ownership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the nature of ownership in general, we can understand the nature of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-ownership in particular. Recall from above that to own an entity is to possess a “bundle of rights” over that entity. &lt;em&gt;Self&lt;/em&gt;-ownership, then, affirms that each person possesses a “bundle of rights” over their body. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/&quot;&gt;SEP entry on libertarianism&lt;/a&gt; described self-ownership as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most [libertarians], however, focus more on the idea of self-ownership. Famously, this view is attributed to Robert Nozick (Cohen 1995; but see the discussion below). On this view, the key libertarian starting point is that people have a very stringent (perhaps the most stringent possible) set of rights over their persons, giving them the kind of control over themselves that one might have over possessions they own. This includes (1) rights to control the use of the entity: including a liberty-right to use it as well as a claim-right that others not use it without one’s consent, (2) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the non-consensual loss of these rights, (4) compensation rights in case others use the entity without one’s consent, and (5) enforcement rights (e.g. rights to restrain persons about to violate these rights).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-ownership, therefore, explains many of the moral rights that we think many persons have. For example, some of the rights entailed from self-ownership include “liberty-right” to use one’s body as well as a “claim-right” that others not use one’s body without one’s consent. This suggests some common moral rights that many take to be important, e.g. that people have liberty-rights to engage in whatever sexual practices they choose, and that people have claim-rights that others not use their body against their will for e.g. forced slavery. Other rights entailed from self-ownership include the right to transfer to others the liberty-rights and claim-rights to control one’s body. This implies that one may, for example, sign a contract that modifies one’s liberty-rights and claim-rights. For example, if one agrees to a (legitimate) contract that they will perform certain labor in exchange for money, then they will no longer have a liberty-right to refrain from performing the contracted labor, and they will no longer have a claim-right that others not punish them for refraining from performing the contracted labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-ownership-accounts-for-many-of-our-moral-convictions&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#self-ownership-explains-many-of-our-strongest-moral-convictions&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Self-ownership accounts for many of our moral convictions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that self-ownership can explain many of our strongest moral convictions. This can be shown by considering cases where infringing on someone’s bodily autonomy may be a useful means to benefit someone else. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/257627/alabama-bill-odds-public-consensus-abortion.aspx&quot;&gt;the majority of Americans&lt;/a&gt; (including most pro-lifers) believe that abortions should be legal in at least certain circumstances (e.g. in the case of rape or incest). For another example, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McFall_v._Shimp&quot;&gt;McFall v. Shimp&lt;/a&gt; which was an actual court case concerning whether the government could force David Shimp to perform a bone marrow transfusion to save his cousin’s life. I think the vast majority of people would agree with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leagle.com/decision/197810010padampc3d90189&quot;&gt;court’s decision&lt;/a&gt; in this case which appealed to the fact that “one human being is under no legal compulsion to give aid or to take action to save another human being or to rescue.” Our opinions in these cases are best explained by the fact that we think people have strong &lt;em&gt;claim-rights&lt;/em&gt; that others not control their bodies without their consent. In other words, people &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; their bodies; each person gets to decide how to use their body. These views are all easily explained by invoking self-ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people endorse many other ordinary freedoms that are best explained by invoking self-ownership. Consider freedom of religion, freedom of sexuality, freedom of occupation, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, etc. An essential part of the justification of these freedoms involves the fact that people &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; their bodies, which gives them a moral right to decide how to use their bodies without being subject to the will of others (so long as they don’t violate a like-right of others). These are freedoms that almost everyone accepts, which suggests that self-ownership may be an implicit commitment that everyone accepts. In fact, many philosophers claim that self-ownership is also a core commitment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/&quot;&gt;classical liberalism&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-philosophy-and-policy/article/selfownership-world-ownership-and-equality-part-ii/705C107C90B22CCF37234C4215AF395E&quot;&gt;G.A. Cohen (1986)&lt;/a&gt; noted that “Liberalism, to idealize one of its traditional senses, may be defined as the thesis that each person has full private property in himself (and, consequently, no private property in anyone else). He may do what he likes with himself provided that he does not harm others” (page 79). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch14&quot;&gt;Brennan et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt; (page 209) has expressed a similar point: “Every liberal thinks we each have strong rights to freely use our persons and to exclude others from them. Every liberal thinks that a woman has the right to say no to a demand for sex, on the grounds that it’s her body. In this sense, then, all liberals accept some version of a self-ownership thesis, though many of them would not describe their beliefs as such…What liberals—both left liberals and libertarians— disagree about is how people own themselves, not that they own themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider the fact that even many socialists object to capitalism based on an implicit assumption of self-ownership. Many socialist critiques of capitalism posit that capitalism enables the exploitation of workers because it creates a system where workers are compelled to transfer surplus labor value to capitalists on pain of severe poverty. There are different socialist accounts of why such a system is exploitative. On &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socialism/#Expl&quot;&gt;one account&lt;/a&gt;, what makes this system exploitative is the fact that “that workers are entitled to the product of their labor, and that capitalists wrongly deprive them of it.” However, this is committed to the claim that workers &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; the product of their labor (in the sense that workers have a liberty-right to use the products of their labor as they please, they have a claim-right against others using these products without the workers’ consent, etc.). It seems that if workers own the product of their labor, then they must also own themselves (after all, if a person doesn’t own themselves, why would they own their labor?). So it seems that even socialists (at least the socialists that invoke this account of exploitation) are committed to some form of self-ownership. G.A. Cohen raised a similar point when criticizing Marx’s account of exploitation (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/exploitation/&quot;&gt;SEP article&lt;/a&gt; on exploitation) as being committed to the libertarian idea of self-ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;world-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#world-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;World-ownership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libertarians who accept self-ownership usually do not believe that people &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; own themselves. Rather, people also own (or are entitled to own) other resources in the world (so long as those resources are not persons). Most libertarians, including myself, accept &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; property, which are resources owned by private individuals who have wide liberty in determining how the resources are to be controlled. I outline my theory of private property in the next subsection. I believe that we should have a strong &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; towards treating resources as private property. However, sometimes it is not feasible to privatize certain resources. When this happens, such resources should be treated as &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; property. I will consider common property after describing my view on private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-property&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#private-property&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Private property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a spectrum of libertarian views on private property, ranging from far-right to far-left depending on the degree to which the theory imposes an egalitarian constraint on the ownership of natural resources. &lt;a href=&quot;https://klinechair.missouri.edu/docs/left_libertarianism_and_liberty.pdf&quot;&gt;Peter Vallentyne (2009)&lt;/a&gt; gives examples of two libertarian theories with radically different stances on property ownership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical right-libertarianism&lt;/em&gt; holds “that there are no constraints on the ownership of natural resources” (page 18). This view permits agents to own an unlimited amount of natural resources. Most libertarians reject this view because it permits a privileged group of individuals to own all valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being morally forbidden from leading their own lives without being subject to the will of others. Non-property owners would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire basic external resources necessary to lead their own life. Instead, libertarians tend to adopt the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/#LeftRight&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lockean proviso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which permits the ownership of natural resources only if “enough and as good” is left for others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical joint-ownership left-libertarianism&lt;/em&gt; holds that “individuals may use natural resources only with the collective (e.g., majority or unanimous) consent of the members of society” (page 17). Most libertarians reject this view because, just like with radical right-libertarianism, it also leaves individuals without the ability to lead their own lives without being subject to the will of others. Instead, libertarians tend to adopt &lt;em&gt;unilateralist&lt;/em&gt; theories which maintain that “under a broad range of circumstances (although perhaps subject to various conditions), (1) agents are initially permitted to use natural resources without anyone’s consent, and (2) agent initially have the power to appropriate (acquire rights over) natural resources without anyone’s consent” (page 18).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most libertarians, I reject both of these radical forms of libertarianism (and probably any other radical forms of libertarianism), and I reject them for the same reason: they deprive individuals of the ability to lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy or will of others (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/delineating-libertarian-ownership-rights-the-anti-paralysis-postulate/&quot;&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; here for more detail on why libertarians should reject these radical theories of property rights). Instead, I adopt a form of &lt;em&gt;Lockean libertarianism,&lt;/em&gt; which is a libertarian theory that is &lt;em&gt;unilateralist&lt;/em&gt; and that subjects property acquisition and ownership to the &lt;em&gt;Lockean proviso__.&lt;/em&gt; Vallentyne describes Lockean Libertarianism as follows (page 20):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us now consider &lt;em&gt;Lockean libertarianism&lt;/em&gt;, which allows unilateral use and appropriation but requires that some version of the Lockean proviso be satisfied. It views natural resources as initially unprotected by any property rule (no consent is needed for use or appropriation) but as protected by a compensation liability rule. Those who use natural resources, or claim rights over them, owe compensation to others for any costs imposed by such use or appropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various theories of Lockean libertarianism differ according to how they interpret the Lockean proviso, i.e. according to how they interpret “enough and as good.” Vallentyne (pages 20-22) gives examples of some forms of Lockean libertarianism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nozickean right-libertarianism&lt;/em&gt; interprets the proviso to require that no one can be made worse off as a result of use or appropriation, compared with a baseline of non-use or non-appropriation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sufficientarian libertarianism&lt;/em&gt; interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring something like a sufficientarian requirement, such that people must have access to an adequate share of natural resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equal share left-libertarianism&lt;/em&gt;: interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring equally valuable shares of natural resources for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equal opportunity left-libertarianism&lt;/em&gt;: interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring compensation for disadvantages that result from different natural abilities (such as the effects of genetic differences).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not have strong confidence in any particular theory of resource ownership, but I currently lean towards something like equal-share left-libertarianism. Specifically, it seems to me that everyone is entitled to an &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt; to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. The reason that opportunity to acquire &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resources specifically ought to be distributed in this &lt;em&gt;egalitarian&lt;/em&gt; manner is that no person has any special moral entitlement to any specific &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resource. My view here is based on the fact that any appropriation of natural resources diminishes the freedom of everyone else (since no one else would be permitted to appropriate such resources). And because no one is entitled to more freedom than anyone else, it follows that no one is entitled to have more opportunity to benefit from natural resources than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; resources, people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have special moral entitlements to their own bodies and the products of their labor. Therefore, wide inequalities are permissible insofar as they result from disparities in the value of different bodies or different labor. For example, some people have more valuable bodies and labor than others (e.g., some people are more intelligent, charismatic, athletic, etc.), and these differences can produce morally acceptable inequalities. On the other hand, inequalities that are the result of disparities in access to natural resources are morally &lt;em&gt;impermissible&lt;/em&gt;, since they reflect the fact that some people had more freedom than others. Everyone should have the opportunity to acquire equally valuable shares of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-property&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#common-property&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Common Property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, we ought to have a presumption toward treating resources as private property. However, sometimes it is infeasible to divide resources into privatized units in a fair manner (where “fair” is defined as I described above). When resources cannot be privatized, the resources should be treated as “common property”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/ambidextrous-lockeanism/601F280B87EEB9E22F0255420BDBB5F4&quot;&gt;Billy Christmas (2019)&lt;/a&gt; describes two kinds of common property: (1) &lt;em&gt;collective property&lt;/em&gt; refers to resources that are “privately owned by a group of persons” who have “the right to exclude (almost) any use of the resource by non-members”, and (2) &lt;em&gt;public property&lt;/em&gt; refers to resources where people in general (not members of a particular group) have “the right to use the resource in a fairly narrow way” (page 12). Christmas gives a good example of a type of common property (page 14):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consider a large fishing pond. When an individual starts fishing, she acquires a right to the pond. No one may take the fish she catches, nor kick her off the embankment, nor engage in noise pollution that scares all the fish away, or water pollution that kills the fish, etc. An additional fisher would not necessarily interfere, however. Assuming the second fisher’s rate of capture did not come at the expense of that of the first fisher’s, then her fishing is non-interfering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pond in this example is considered common (rather than private) because the pond is more open to new users than private property, and is considered public (rather than collective) because the rights to use the pond are not limited to some special group. The reason the pond in this example may be public is that individuals may use the pond in certain ways that do not interfere with others using the pond in the same way. However, because the pond is finite, there is a limit to the number of people who can use the pond before it is overcrowded. Once the pond is overcrowded, each individual user of the pond would interfere with existing users of the pond. Therefore, if the pond is at risk of overcrowding, this warrants treating the pond as &lt;em&gt;collective&lt;/em&gt; (rather than &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt;) property, i.e. this warrants a select group of individuals (e.g. perhaps only people that live around the pond) having the right to exclude other people from using the pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;further-questions-regarding-ownership-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#further-questions-regarding-ownership-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Further questions regarding ownership rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if we determine which persons own which entities, this is not sufficient to answer all questions regarding if and when we may intrude on the property and bodies of others. There are (at least) two reasons for this: (1) there is some indeterminacy with respect to the “bundle of rights” associated with ownership, so we need further argument to determine which specific set of rights are entailed from one’s ownership of an entity; and (2) we need further argument to determine if it is ever permissible to violate someone’s ownership rights (i.e. to determine if ownership rights are &lt;em&gt;defeasible&lt;/em&gt;). In this section, I will attempt to address both of these tasks in turn. I will adopt what one libertarian philosopher calls the “elbow room” postulate as a guide for delineating ownership rights when they are indeterminate, and I will give some conditions for what are called “exception rights” which permit intruding on someone’s property or body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indeterminacy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#indeterminacy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Indeterminacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some &lt;em&gt;indeterminacy&lt;/em&gt; regarding the specific “bundle of rights” associated with ownership. This is because there are many different rights associated with ownership and these rights can sometimes conflict. &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/OTSUKAM/leftlibP&amp;amp;PA.pdf&quot;&gt;Vallentyne et al. (2005)&lt;/a&gt; (page 205) gives an example of some such indeterminacy regarding rights to enforcement, compensation, and immunity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us start by identifying the indeterminacy, which arises because there is no uniquely strongest set of ownership rights. This is so because strengthening one person’s compensation or enforcement rights weakens the immunity to loss of another person. Thus, there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights. Everyone could have very strong compensation and enforcement rights against those who violate their rights, but this would entail that everyone has a less than maximal immunity to loss of their ownership rights (since their liberty to use the things they own and the security against interference from others would be reduced when they violate the rights of others). Alternatively (to pick the other extreme), everyone could have very weak compensation and enforcement rights, while having a relatively strong immunity to loss. Neither set of rights is unequivocally stronger than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some of the indeterminacy stems from the conflict between enforcement, compensation, and immunity rights. There is (I believe) more serious indeterminacy that stems from an inherent conflict between liberty-rights and claim-rights. Liberty-rights provide &lt;em&gt;permissions&lt;/em&gt; (for the rights-holder) to perform certain actions, and claim-rights provide &lt;em&gt;prohibitions&lt;/em&gt; (for non-rights-holders) to perform certain actions. So when determining how to delineate rights, liberty-rights and claim-rights can come into conflict and we must make a decision on how to resolve the conflicts. We have to be careful not to overvalue one component of these rights at the expense of the other. For example, if maximized everyone’s claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights, this would result in “moral paralysis”, i.e. we would be prohibiting from imposing the most minor intrusions on anyone else’s property (e.g. I would be prohibited from breathing because this might lead to air particles landing on your property), which makes all action impermissible. On the other hand, if we maximized everyone’s liberty-rights at the expense of claim-rights, this would result in “moral anarchy”, i.e. this would permit people to perform far many actions (e.g. you would have no claim-right against me taking your property).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a guide to determine how to delineate rights in cases of the indeterminacy described above. The ideal delineation of rights must involve some trade-off between liberty-rights and claim-rights. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch14&quot;&gt;Brennan and Vossen (2017)&lt;/a&gt; (page 209) discuss this trade-off in some more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protection (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing on the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a guide for determining how to delineate rights, I endorse using what &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=sites&amp;amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwcm9mZXNzb3JlcmljbWFja3xneDo5NDMzMGE1ODkxOTJiOWY&quot;&gt;Eric Mack (2015)&lt;/a&gt; calls the “elbow room” postulate. Mack defines the postulate as a claim that (page 197) “a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect.” He argues that a reasonable delineation of rights does not prohibit minor intrusions of someone’s property “since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying.” In other words, we should not ascribe claim-rights so strong that they nullify the liberty-rights that they were meant to protect. I consider this principle in more detail in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/delineating-libertarian-ownership-rights-the-anti-paralysis-postulate/&quot;&gt;separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defeasibility-and-exception-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#defeasibility-and-exception-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Defeasibility and exception rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question regarding ownership rights concerns whether such rights are &lt;em&gt;absolute.&lt;/em&gt; I said earlier that to ascribe a moral right to a person is to, in part, impose &lt;em&gt;moral obligations&lt;/em&gt; on others, e.g. if I have the right to eat what I choose, then others are morally obligated to refrain from forcing me to have a certain diet. If moral rights are &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt;, then they would produce &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; moral obligations, i.e. the obligations hold in all cases. But if moral rights are &lt;em&gt;defeasible&lt;/em&gt;, then they would merely produce what W.D. Ross calls “&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-david-ross/#Rig&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; moral obligations&lt;/a&gt;”. If one has a prima-facie moral obligation to X, then this establishes that one has an obligation to X &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; there is a special reason that &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasoning-defeasible/#DefeObli&quot;&gt;defeats&lt;/a&gt; the obligation in certain extenuating circumstances. In other words, a prima-facie obligation to X establishes a strong moral &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; to X. This is similar to the way “prima facie” is used &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1598&quot;&gt;in legal contexts&lt;/a&gt; where it refers to “a lawsuit or criminal prosecution in which the evidence before trial is &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; to prove the case unless there is substantial contradictory evidence presented at trial.” In other words, while a prima-facie obligation &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be defeated in special circumstances, it establishes a high &lt;em&gt;burden of proof&lt;/em&gt; that must be met to justify violating the obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of an ordinary prima-facie moral obligation, consider killing. Everyone agrees that we have a moral obligation to not kill others. However, there are clearly special circumstances where killing is permissible (e.g. killing in self-defense, killing to relieve someone of extreme suffering, killing in war, killing someone with their consent, killing as a means to save humanity from extermination, etc.). So how are we to understand the moral obligation against killing? One way to understand the obligation is to formulate it is as as a conclusive obligation that takes into account all of the exceptions, i.e. the prohibition on killing can be understood as the claim that “it is wrong to kill &lt;em&gt;unless it is done in self-defense, or to relieve someone of suffering, or to save humanity from extermination, etc.&lt;/em&gt;” But this way of understanding the obligation on killing is implausible because there could be an unbounded number of exceptions and (I believe) we should never be confident that we have found all exceptions. Instead, the prohibition on killing should be understood as a &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; prohibition on killing, i.e. it is wrong to kill someone, aside from extenuating circumstances where special reasons can justify killing in such circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that ownership rights are &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; (I’m not convinced that there are &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; conclusive moral obligations). I believe that there can be extreme circumstances in which individuals are permitted to intrude on someone’s body or property. For example, I believe such intrusions are permissible when the following conditions hold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A disadvantaged person finds themselves in a &lt;em&gt;perilous&lt;/em&gt; situation. For example, their life is in danger.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The disadvantaged person is in this situation through no &lt;em&gt;fault&lt;/em&gt; of their own. For example, their life is in danger because a murderer is trying to kill them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order for the disadvantaged person to escape the perilous situation, it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; to intrude on someone else’s body or property without their consent. For example, they can defend themselves from the murderer only by taking a stranger’s axe (without their consent) to kill the murderer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The intrusion imposed is of a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; amount. For example, the owner of the axe does not need it for anything serious (otherwise, taking his axe may impose on him an unreasonable burden).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these conditions are met, I believe it is morally permissible to intrude upon someone in a situation that would ordinarily be a rights violation. One example was given when listing out the conditions, e.g. it is permissible to take someone’s axe without the owner’s consent (assuming the owner does not need the axe for anything serious) to defend oneself from a murderer. For another example, I believe it is morally permissible to break a neighbor’s fence to rescue a child drowning in their neighbor’s pool. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch11&quot;&gt;Nicolás Maloberti (2017)&lt;/a&gt; referred to these rights as “exception rights”. I give more detail on the justification and implications of exception rights in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/justifying-the-state-on-libertarian-grounds/&quot;&gt;separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other libertarians philosophers permit more defeaters to ownership rights. For example, left-libertarian Michael Otsuka has argued that rights infringements as &lt;em&gt;side-effects&lt;/em&gt; may be more justifiable than infringements as &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543979/file/8543981.pdf&quot;&gt;page 127&lt;/a&gt;, also see: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/&quot;&gt;the doctrine of double effect&lt;/a&gt;). Even right-libertarian &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nozick-political/#AttRig&quot;&gt;Robert Nozick&lt;/a&gt; believed that we may be permitted to intrude upon someone’s property in certain cases so long as the property owner is duly compensated (moreover, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/readings/nozick.pdf&quot;&gt;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&lt;/a&gt;, he does not rule out whether it is permissible to violate moral rights in order to avoid “catastrophic moral horror” [footnote of page 30]). Both Otsuka’s and Nozick’s positions seem fairly intuitive at first glance, but I don’t currently have a strong position on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it seems clear that intruding on someone’s body or property is permissible under the four conditions that I outlined earlier, i.e. as a necessary means to bring faultless individuals out of perilous circumstances. Therefore, ownership rights are &lt;em&gt;defeasible&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. they provide &lt;em&gt;prima-facie&lt;/em&gt; moral obligations as opposed to &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; obligations. This means that ownership rights should be understood as entailing a strong moral &lt;em&gt;presumption&lt;/em&gt; against intruding on someone’s body or property, while granting that intrusions can be justified in certain extenuating circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to summarize the main claims of this post post. First, like almost all libertarians, I endorse self-ownership, which is constituted by a bundle of specific rights including a liberty-right to use their body in ways that they choose and a claim-right that others do not use one’s body without their consent. Regarding world-ownership, I believe we should have a strong presumption towards treating resources as private property. I believe private property ought to be distributed such that everyone has the opportunity to acquire equally valuable shares of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. When privatization is not feasible, resources should be treated as common property. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/state-activities-compatible-with-libertarian-ownership-rights/&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt;, I discuss the implications that I believe my theory of libertarian ownership rights has on the permissible activities of the state.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">I will describe in this post what I take to be a plausible form of libertarian ownership rights. This post is meant as an exercise to formulate, rather than justify, my preferred form of libertarianism. I will occasionally provide some justifications for my positions on various issues, but they must be brief (otherwise the post would never end!). This exercise allows me to clarify and connect a wide range of my political opinions. I start by illuminating what most libertarians take to be the core of libertarianism: self-ownership. I will describe the nature of self-ownership and explain why it is not a mysterious or implausible concept. Next, I discuss world-ownership, which concerns the ownership of non-persons. Here, I describe my theory of private property and describe cases where resources ought to be treated as common property rather than private property. Finally, I will consider questions related to the indeterminacy and defeasibility of ownership rights. Self-ownership Most libertarians, myself included, ground their theory in self-ownership (some libertarians attempt to ground their theory in something like the non-aggression principle, but there are many serious problems with this kind of view as Zwolinski (2016) has described). In this section, I will describe the nature of self-ownership and explain why it is not a mysterious or implausible concept. To show that self-ownership is not mysterious, I will describe the nature of moral rights and enumerate some of the rights associated with self-ownership. To show that self-ownership is not implausible, I will show how the vast majority of people (including libertarians, liberals, and even socialists) appeal to self-ownership (or something close to self-ownership) to explain many of the rights they find important. Ownership When libertarians speak of “ownership”, they are not speaking about what people legally own. Libertarianism is not a legal theory. Some people might take this to be metaphysically mysterious. After all, what does it mean to say that someone owns an entity above and beyond what the law specifies? It might seem that the rejection of a legal sense of ownership commits one to a queer and implausible metaphysical sense of ownership, based on some weird metaphysical relation between a person and the entity that they own. But libertarianism is not committed to such metaphysical claims about ownership. Libertarianism is only committed to moral claims about ownership. When libertarians claim that a person owns an entity, this only necessitates a moral relation between the person, the entity, and other persons. That moral relation consists in a “bundle of rights” associated with the entity. Vallentyne et al (2005) (page 204) described the “bundle of rights” associated with ownership as follows: Full private ownership of an object consists of a full set of the following ownership rights: (1) control rights over the use of the object; (2) rights to compensation if someone uses the object without one’s permission; (3) enforcement rights (to prevent the violation of these rights or to extract compensation owed for past violation); (4) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan); and (5) immunity to the nonconsensual loss of any of the rights of ownership. What was said about “ownership” above can also be said about “rights” here. Rights should not be understood as legal rights. Libertarianism is not concerned with interpreting legal rights. Libertarianism is concerned with moral rights. Just like the idea of “ownership”, someone might object to the idea of “moral rights” due to an assumption that the idea involves mysterious metaphysical claims about the existence of said rights. After all, there are no rights found in nature independent of human construction. But, also like the idea of “ownership”, the invocation of moral rights does not commit one to any metaphysical claims. To say that a person has certain moral rights is merely to assert a set of moral claims. More specifically, to ascribe to a person a certain moral right is to make claims about what they are morally permitted to do and what others are morally prohibited from doing. Surely, there is nothing metaphysical mysterious about saying that people are morally permitted to perform or prohibited from performing certain actions. Following the SEP article on rights, most rights consist of some combination of some number of four basic components (which are called “Hohfeldian incidents”): Privileges (or liberties): A has a privilege to φ if and only if A has no duty not to φ. Claims: A has a claim that B φ if and only if B has a duty to A to φ. Powers: A has a power if and only if A has the ability to alter her own or another’s Hohfeldian incidents. Immunities: B has an immunity if and only if A lacks the ability to alter B’s Hohfeldian incidents. For example, if you have the right to pick up a shell you find on the beach, this right would be a privilege (or liberty) to pick up the shell (i.e. you have no moral duty to not pick up the shell). If you have the right to privacy, then this right would be a claim on others (i.e. others have a moral duty to not intrude on your privacy). Some rights can be understood as either privileges or claims. For example, a right to food might be understood as a privilege to acquire food or a claim that others subsidize or refrain from interfering with one’s acquisition of food. From my perspective, all moral rights involve claims (within the context of political philosophy), and I will be operating from this perspective for the rest of the post. For an example of a power, consider when someone sells a house. Initially, when the person owns the house, they have the privilege to use the house and they have a claim that others not use the house with their consent. However, if they sell the house to someone else, then this will transfer these liberties and claims to the other person. Self-ownership Now that we understand the nature of ownership in general, we can understand the nature of self-ownership in particular. Recall from above that to own an entity is to possess a “bundle of rights” over that entity. Self-ownership, then, affirms that each person possesses a “bundle of rights” over their body. The SEP entry on libertarianism described self-ownership as follows: Most [libertarians], however, focus more on the idea of self-ownership. Famously, this view is attributed to Robert Nozick (Cohen 1995; but see the discussion below). On this view, the key libertarian starting point is that people have a very stringent (perhaps the most stringent possible) set of rights over their persons, giving them the kind of control over themselves that one might have over possessions they own. This includes (1) rights to control the use of the entity: including a liberty-right to use it as well as a claim-right that others not use it without one’s consent, (2) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale, rental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the non-consensual loss of these rights, (4) compensation rights in case others use the entity without one’s consent, and (5) enforcement rights (e.g. rights to restrain persons about to violate these rights). Self-ownership, therefore, explains many of the moral rights that we think many persons have. For example, some of the rights entailed from self-ownership include “liberty-right” to use one’s body as well as a “claim-right” that others not use one’s body without one’s consent. This suggests some common moral rights that many take to be important, e.g. that people have liberty-rights to engage in whatever sexual practices they choose, and that people have claim-rights that others not use their body against their will for e.g. forced slavery. Other rights entailed from self-ownership include the right to transfer to others the liberty-rights and claim-rights to control one’s body. This implies that one may, for example, sign a contract that modifies one’s liberty-rights and claim-rights. For example, if one agrees to a (legitimate) contract that they will perform certain labor in exchange for money, then they will no longer have a liberty-right to refrain from performing the contracted labor, and they will no longer have a claim-right that others not punish them for refraining from performing the contracted labor. Self-ownership accounts for many of our moral convictions I believe that self-ownership can explain many of our strongest moral convictions. This can be shown by considering cases where infringing on someone’s bodily autonomy may be a useful means to benefit someone else. For example, the majority of Americans (including most pro-lifers) believe that abortions should be legal in at least certain circumstances (e.g. in the case of rape or incest). For another example, consider McFall v. Shimp which was an actual court case concerning whether the government could force David Shimp to perform a bone marrow transfusion to save his cousin’s life. I think the vast majority of people would agree with the court’s decision in this case which appealed to the fact that “one human being is under no legal compulsion to give aid or to take action to save another human being or to rescue.” Our opinions in these cases are best explained by the fact that we think people have strong claim-rights that others not control their bodies without their consent. In other words, people own their bodies; each person gets to decide how to use their body. These views are all easily explained by invoking self-ownership. The vast majority of people endorse many other ordinary freedoms that are best explained by invoking self-ownership. Consider freedom of religion, freedom of sexuality, freedom of occupation, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, etc. An essential part of the justification of these freedoms involves the fact that people own their bodies, which gives them a moral right to decide how to use their bodies without being subject to the will of others (so long as they don’t violate a like-right of others). These are freedoms that almost everyone accepts, which suggests that self-ownership may be an implicit commitment that everyone accepts. In fact, many philosophers claim that self-ownership is also a core commitment of classical liberalism. For example, G.A. Cohen (1986) noted that “Liberalism, to idealize one of its traditional senses, may be defined as the thesis that each person has full private property in himself (and, consequently, no private property in anyone else). He may do what he likes with himself provided that he does not harm others” (page 79). Brennan et al. (2017) (page 209) has expressed a similar point: “Every liberal thinks we each have strong rights to freely use our persons and to exclude others from them. Every liberal thinks that a woman has the right to say no to a demand for sex, on the grounds that it’s her body. In this sense, then, all liberals accept some version of a self-ownership thesis, though many of them would not describe their beliefs as such…What liberals—both left liberals and libertarians— disagree about is how people own themselves, not that they own themselves.” Finally, consider the fact that even many socialists object to capitalism based on an implicit assumption of self-ownership. Many socialist critiques of capitalism posit that capitalism enables the exploitation of workers because it creates a system where workers are compelled to transfer surplus labor value to capitalists on pain of severe poverty. There are different socialist accounts of why such a system is exploitative. On one account, what makes this system exploitative is the fact that “that workers are entitled to the product of their labor, and that capitalists wrongly deprive them of it.” However, this is committed to the claim that workers own the product of their labor (in the sense that workers have a liberty-right to use the products of their labor as they please, they have a claim-right against others using these products without the workers’ consent, etc.). It seems that if workers own the product of their labor, then they must also own themselves (after all, if a person doesn’t own themselves, why would they own their labor?). So it seems that even socialists (at least the socialists that invoke this account of exploitation) are committed to some form of self-ownership. G.A. Cohen raised a similar point when criticizing Marx’s account of exploitation (see SEP article on exploitation) as being committed to the libertarian idea of self-ownership. World-ownership Libertarians who accept self-ownership usually do not believe that people merely own themselves. Rather, people also own (or are entitled to own) other resources in the world (so long as those resources are not persons). Most libertarians, including myself, accept private property, which are resources owned by private individuals who have wide liberty in determining how the resources are to be controlled. I outline my theory of private property in the next subsection. I believe that we should have a strong presumption towards treating resources as private property. However, sometimes it is not feasible to privatize certain resources. When this happens, such resources should be treated as common property. I will consider common property after describing my view on private property. Private property There is a spectrum of libertarian views on private property, ranging from far-right to far-left depending on the degree to which the theory imposes an egalitarian constraint on the ownership of natural resources. Peter Vallentyne (2009) gives examples of two libertarian theories with radically different stances on property ownership: Radical right-libertarianism holds “that there are no constraints on the ownership of natural resources” (page 18). This view permits agents to own an unlimited amount of natural resources. Most libertarians reject this view because it permits a privileged group of individuals to own all valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being morally forbidden from leading their own lives without being subject to the will of others. Non-property owners would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire basic external resources necessary to lead their own life. Instead, libertarians tend to adopt the Lockean proviso, which permits the ownership of natural resources only if “enough and as good” is left for others. Radical joint-ownership left-libertarianism holds that “individuals may use natural resources only with the collective (e.g., majority or unanimous) consent of the members of society” (page 17). Most libertarians reject this view because, just like with radical right-libertarianism, it also leaves individuals without the ability to lead their own lives without being subject to the will of others. Instead, libertarians tend to adopt unilateralist theories which maintain that “under a broad range of circumstances (although perhaps subject to various conditions), (1) agents are initially permitted to use natural resources without anyone’s consent, and (2) agent initially have the power to appropriate (acquire rights over) natural resources without anyone’s consent” (page 18). Like most libertarians, I reject both of these radical forms of libertarianism (and probably any other radical forms of libertarianism), and I reject them for the same reason: they deprive individuals of the ability to lead their own lives without being subject to the mercy or will of others (see my post here for more detail on why libertarians should reject these radical theories of property rights). Instead, I adopt a form of Lockean libertarianism, which is a libertarian theory that is unilateralist and that subjects property acquisition and ownership to the Lockean proviso__. Vallentyne describes Lockean Libertarianism as follows (page 20): Let us now consider Lockean libertarianism, which allows unilateral use and appropriation but requires that some version of the Lockean proviso be satisfied. It views natural resources as initially unprotected by any property rule (no consent is needed for use or appropriation) but as protected by a compensation liability rule. Those who use natural resources, or claim rights over them, owe compensation to others for any costs imposed by such use or appropriation. Various theories of Lockean libertarianism differ according to how they interpret the Lockean proviso, i.e. according to how they interpret “enough and as good.” Vallentyne (pages 20-22) gives examples of some forms of Lockean libertarianism: Nozickean right-libertarianism interprets the proviso to require that no one can be made worse off as a result of use or appropriation, compared with a baseline of non-use or non-appropriation. Sufficientarian libertarianism interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring something like a sufficientarian requirement, such that people must have access to an adequate share of natural resources. Equal share left-libertarianism: interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring equally valuable shares of natural resources for everyone. Equal opportunity left-libertarianism: interprets the Lockean proviso as requiring compensation for disadvantages that result from different natural abilities (such as the effects of genetic differences). I do not have strong confidence in any particular theory of resource ownership, but I currently lean towards something like equal-share left-libertarianism. Specifically, it seems to me that everyone is entitled to an opportunity to acquire an equally valuable share of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. The reason that opportunity to acquire natural resources specifically ought to be distributed in this egalitarian manner is that no person has any special moral entitlement to any specific natural resource. My view here is based on the fact that any appropriation of natural resources diminishes the freedom of everyone else (since no one else would be permitted to appropriate such resources). And because no one is entitled to more freedom than anyone else, it follows that no one is entitled to have more opportunity to benefit from natural resources than anyone else. In contrast to natural resources, people do have special moral entitlements to their own bodies and the products of their labor. Therefore, wide inequalities are permissible insofar as they result from disparities in the value of different bodies or different labor. For example, some people have more valuable bodies and labor than others (e.g., some people are more intelligent, charismatic, athletic, etc.), and these differences can produce morally acceptable inequalities. On the other hand, inequalities that are the result of disparities in access to natural resources are morally impermissible, since they reflect the fact that some people had more freedom than others. Everyone should have the opportunity to acquire equally valuable shares of natural resources. Common Property As stated earlier, we ought to have a presumption toward treating resources as private property. However, sometimes it is infeasible to divide resources into privatized units in a fair manner (where “fair” is defined as I described above). When resources cannot be privatized, the resources should be treated as “common property”. Billy Christmas (2019) describes two kinds of common property: (1) collective property refers to resources that are “privately owned by a group of persons” who have “the right to exclude (almost) any use of the resource by non-members”, and (2) public property refers to resources where people in general (not members of a particular group) have “the right to use the resource in a fairly narrow way” (page 12). Christmas gives a good example of a type of common property (page 14): Consider a large fishing pond. When an individual starts fishing, she acquires a right to the pond. No one may take the fish she catches, nor kick her off the embankment, nor engage in noise pollution that scares all the fish away, or water pollution that kills the fish, etc. An additional fisher would not necessarily interfere, however. Assuming the second fisher’s rate of capture did not come at the expense of that of the first fisher’s, then her fishing is non-interfering. The pond in this example is considered common (rather than private) because the pond is more open to new users than private property, and is considered public (rather than collective) because the rights to use the pond are not limited to some special group. The reason the pond in this example may be public is that individuals may use the pond in certain ways that do not interfere with others using the pond in the same way. However, because the pond is finite, there is a limit to the number of people who can use the pond before it is overcrowded. Once the pond is overcrowded, each individual user of the pond would interfere with existing users of the pond. Therefore, if the pond is at risk of overcrowding, this warrants treating the pond as collective (rather than public) property, i.e. this warrants a select group of individuals (e.g. perhaps only people that live around the pond) having the right to exclude other people from using the pond. Further questions regarding ownership rights Even if we determine which persons own which entities, this is not sufficient to answer all questions regarding if and when we may intrude on the property and bodies of others. There are (at least) two reasons for this: (1) there is some indeterminacy with respect to the “bundle of rights” associated with ownership, so we need further argument to determine which specific set of rights are entailed from one’s ownership of an entity; and (2) we need further argument to determine if it is ever permissible to violate someone’s ownership rights (i.e. to determine if ownership rights are defeasible). In this section, I will attempt to address both of these tasks in turn. I will adopt what one libertarian philosopher calls the “elbow room” postulate as a guide for delineating ownership rights when they are indeterminate, and I will give some conditions for what are called “exception rights” which permit intruding on someone’s property or body. Indeterminacy There is some indeterminacy regarding the specific “bundle of rights” associated with ownership. This is because there are many different rights associated with ownership and these rights can sometimes conflict. Vallentyne et al. (2005) (page 205) gives an example of some such indeterminacy regarding rights to enforcement, compensation, and immunity: Let us start by identifying the indeterminacy, which arises because there is no uniquely strongest set of ownership rights. This is so because strengthening one person’s compensation or enforcement rights weakens the immunity to loss of another person. Thus, there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights. Everyone could have very strong compensation and enforcement rights against those who violate their rights, but this would entail that everyone has a less than maximal immunity to loss of their ownership rights (since their liberty to use the things they own and the security against interference from others would be reduced when they violate the rights of others). Alternatively (to pick the other extreme), everyone could have very weak compensation and enforcement rights, while having a relatively strong immunity to loss. Neither set of rights is unequivocally stronger than the other. So some of the indeterminacy stems from the conflict between enforcement, compensation, and immunity rights. There is (I believe) more serious indeterminacy that stems from an inherent conflict between liberty-rights and claim-rights. Liberty-rights provide permissions (for the rights-holder) to perform certain actions, and claim-rights provide prohibitions (for non-rights-holders) to perform certain actions. So when determining how to delineate rights, liberty-rights and claim-rights can come into conflict and we must make a decision on how to resolve the conflicts. We have to be careful not to overvalue one component of these rights at the expense of the other. For example, if maximized everyone’s claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights, this would result in “moral paralysis”, i.e. we would be prohibiting from imposing the most minor intrusions on anyone else’s property (e.g. I would be prohibited from breathing because this might lead to air particles landing on your property), which makes all action impermissible. On the other hand, if we maximized everyone’s liberty-rights at the expense of claim-rights, this would result in “moral anarchy”, i.e. this would permit people to perform far many actions (e.g. you would have no claim-right against me taking your property). We need a guide to determine how to delineate rights in cases of the indeterminacy described above. The ideal delineation of rights must involve some trade-off between liberty-rights and claim-rights. Brennan and Vossen (2017) (page 209) discuss this trade-off in some more detail: More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protection (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other.” The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing on the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable. As a guide for determining how to delineate rights, I endorse using what Eric Mack (2015) calls the “elbow room” postulate. Mack defines the postulate as a claim that (page 197) “a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect.” He argues that a reasonable delineation of rights does not prohibit minor intrusions of someone’s property “since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying.” In other words, we should not ascribe claim-rights so strong that they nullify the liberty-rights that they were meant to protect. I consider this principle in more detail in a separate post. Defeasibility and exception rights One question regarding ownership rights concerns whether such rights are absolute. I said earlier that to ascribe a moral right to a person is to, in part, impose moral obligations on others, e.g. if I have the right to eat what I choose, then others are morally obligated to refrain from forcing me to have a certain diet. If moral rights are absolute, then they would produce conclusive moral obligations, i.e. the obligations hold in all cases. But if moral rights are defeasible, then they would merely produce what W.D. Ross calls “prima-facie moral obligations”. If one has a prima-facie moral obligation to X, then this establishes that one has an obligation to X unless there is a special reason that defeats the obligation in certain extenuating circumstances. In other words, a prima-facie obligation to X establishes a strong moral presumption to X. This is similar to the way “prima facie” is used in legal contexts where it refers to “a lawsuit or criminal prosecution in which the evidence before trial is sufficient to prove the case unless there is substantial contradictory evidence presented at trial.” In other words, while a prima-facie obligation can be defeated in special circumstances, it establishes a high burden of proof that must be met to justify violating the obligation. For an example of an ordinary prima-facie moral obligation, consider killing. Everyone agrees that we have a moral obligation to not kill others. However, there are clearly special circumstances where killing is permissible (e.g. killing in self-defense, killing to relieve someone of extreme suffering, killing in war, killing someone with their consent, killing as a means to save humanity from extermination, etc.). So how are we to understand the moral obligation against killing? One way to understand the obligation is to formulate it is as as a conclusive obligation that takes into account all of the exceptions, i.e. the prohibition on killing can be understood as the claim that “it is wrong to kill unless it is done in self-defense, or to relieve someone of suffering, or to save humanity from extermination, etc.” But this way of understanding the obligation on killing is implausible because there could be an unbounded number of exceptions and (I believe) we should never be confident that we have found all exceptions. Instead, the prohibition on killing should be understood as a prima-facie prohibition on killing, i.e. it is wrong to kill someone, aside from extenuating circumstances where special reasons can justify killing in such circumstances. I believe that ownership rights are prima-facie rather than conclusive (I’m not convinced that there are any conclusive moral obligations). I believe that there can be extreme circumstances in which individuals are permitted to intrude on someone’s body or property. For example, I believe such intrusions are permissible when the following conditions hold: A disadvantaged person finds themselves in a perilous situation. For example, their life is in danger. The disadvantaged person is in this situation through no fault of their own. For example, their life is in danger because a murderer is trying to kill them. In order for the disadvantaged person to escape the perilous situation, it is necessary to intrude on someone else’s body or property without their consent. For example, they can defend themselves from the murderer only by taking a stranger’s axe (without their consent) to kill the murderer. The intrusion imposed is of a reasonable amount. For example, the owner of the axe does not need it for anything serious (otherwise, taking his axe may impose on him an unreasonable burden). When these conditions are met, I believe it is morally permissible to intrude upon someone in a situation that would ordinarily be a rights violation. One example was given when listing out the conditions, e.g. it is permissible to take someone’s axe without the owner’s consent (assuming the owner does not need the axe for anything serious) to defend oneself from a murderer. For another example, I believe it is morally permissible to break a neighbor’s fence to rescue a child drowning in their neighbor’s pool. Nicolás Maloberti (2017) referred to these rights as “exception rights”. I give more detail on the justification and implications of exception rights in a separate post. Other libertarians philosophers permit more defeaters to ownership rights. For example, left-libertarian Michael Otsuka has argued that rights infringements as side-effects may be more justifiable than infringements as means (page 127, also see: the doctrine of double effect). Even right-libertarian Robert Nozick believed that we may be permitted to intrude upon someone’s property in certain cases so long as the property owner is duly compensated (moreover, in Anarchy, State, and Utopia, he does not rule out whether it is permissible to violate moral rights in order to avoid “catastrophic moral horror” [footnote of page 30]). Both Otsuka’s and Nozick’s positions seem fairly intuitive at first glance, but I don’t currently have a strong position on them. Regardless, it seems clear that intruding on someone’s body or property is permissible under the four conditions that I outlined earlier, i.e. as a necessary means to bring faultless individuals out of perilous circumstances. Therefore, ownership rights are defeasible rather than absolute, i.e. they provide prima-facie moral obligations as opposed to conclusive obligations. This means that ownership rights should be understood as entailing a strong moral presumption against intruding on someone’s body or property, while granting that intrusions can be justified in certain extenuating circumstances. Conclusion Allow me to summarize the main claims of this post post. First, like almost all libertarians, I endorse self-ownership, which is constituted by a bundle of specific rights including a liberty-right to use their body in ways that they choose and a claim-right that others do not use one’s body without their consent. Regarding world-ownership, I believe we should have a strong presumption towards treating resources as private property. I believe private property ought to be distributed such that everyone has the opportunity to acquire equally valuable shares of natural resources, where “valuable” is measured in terms of economic value. When privatization is not feasible, resources should be treated as common property. In another post, I discuss the implications that I believe my theory of libertarian ownership rights has on the permissible activities of the state.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why Consequentialism should be rejected</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Consequentialism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why Consequentialism should be rejected" /><published>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Consequentialism</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Consequentialism.html">&lt;p&gt;Following the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/&quot;&gt;consequentialism&lt;/a&gt; is a moral theory that states that the moral rightness of an act depends only on the goodness of certain consequences associated with the act. There are many different consequentialist systems, e.g. ethical egoism vs utilitarianism, act-consequentialism vs rule-consequentialism, etc. What consequentialist views share in common is that they take facts about the “right” to depend only on facts about the “good”.

In other words, once we know about the &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt; of certain consequences associated with an act (or rules permitting the act), we have all the information necessary to determine the moral &lt;em&gt;rightness&lt;/em&gt; of the act. This is unlike non-consequentialists such as Rawls or Kant who believe that the “right” to be in some ways prior to the “good”, or at least that the “right” is separate from the “good”. I agree with Rawls and Kant in this respect. Consequentialists are incorrect to state that facts about the “right” depend only on facts about the “good”. While the goodness of consequences is certainly &lt;em&gt;relevant&lt;/em&gt; to determining the rightness of an action, I will argue in this post that there are &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; features that are morally relevant as well. Before getting to the argument, we must first understand what is meant by “good” and “right”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-right-and-the-good-as-distinct-concepts&quot;&gt;The “right” and the “good” as distinct concepts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s immediate reaction to hearing that the “right” is prior to the “good” might be confusion. After all, don’t “good” and “right” pretty much express the same concept? They are both normative concepts that are ascribed to things that are in some way desirable or favorable, so in what sense can one be prior to the other? The “right” and the “good” might be related, but it can be shown that they do not express the same concept because they don’t have the same &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt;. They do not have the same meaning because the terms cannot be substituted with one another in a sentence without altering the meaning of the sentence. In the chapter “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ditext.com/ross/right1.html&quot;&gt;The Meaning of Right&lt;/a&gt;” from William David Ross’s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0199252653.001.0001/acprof-9780199252657&quot;&gt;The Right and the Good&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - which is “arguably one of the most important works of moral philosophy published in the twentieth century” according to the SEP entry on &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-david-ross/&quot;&gt;the author&lt;/a&gt; - Ross (1930) argued famously that the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; have different meanings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems to me clear that ‘right’ does not mean the same as ‘morally good’; and we can test this by trying to substitute one for the other. If they meant the same thing we should be able to substitute, for instance, ‘he is a right man’ for ‘he is a morally good man’; nor is our inability to do this merely a matter of English idiom, for if we turn to the sort of moral judgement in which we do use the word ‘right_, such as ‘&lt;em&gt;this is the right act, it is clear that by this we mean ‘this act is the act _that ought to be done&lt;/em&gt;’, ‘this act is &lt;em&gt;morally obligatory&lt;/em&gt;’; and to substitute either of these phrases for ‘morally good’ in ‘he is a morally good man’ would obviously be not merely unidiomatic, but absurd. It should be obvious, then, that ‘right’ and ‘morally good’ mean different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences between the concept of &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; and the concept of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; can be illustrated by contrasting the two normative classes that these concepts respectively belong to. &lt;em&gt;Right&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;deontic&lt;/em&gt; concept whereas &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;evaluative&lt;/em&gt; concept. Deontic concepts include normative concepts such as &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;duty&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;warrant,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;permitted, prohibited,&lt;/em&gt; etc. Evaluative concepts include normative concepts such as &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bad,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;noble,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;desirable, admirable,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;worthy,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/archive/TAPTNO.pdf&quot;&gt;Christine Tappolet (2014)&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted some of the key distinctions between deontic and evaluative concepts (p. 1):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The concepts that count as normative can appear quite heterogenous. However, some groupings seem natural. Thus, it is generally admitted that we can divide these concepts into two large distinct groups: evaluative or axiological concepts (from the latin &lt;em&gt;valores&lt;/em&gt; or the Greek axos, both meaning that which has worth), such as &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, and deontic concepts (from the Greek &lt;em&gt;deon&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that which is binding), such as &lt;em&gt;obligatory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;permissible&lt;/em&gt;… The distinction between evaluative and deontic consists in a generalisation of the traditional opposition between the good and the right .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the paper, she highlights a number of distinctions between the two conceptual families. Some examples include the following: the fact that we can make logical inference &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; either family but we can not (obviously) make such inference across families (p. 4); the fact that evaluative concepts can be applied to a wider range of things (e.g. actions, persons, objects, states of affairs can all be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;admirable&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) whereas deontic concepts are typically restricted to what is subject to the will of an agent (p. 10); the fact that deontic concepts are typically affirmed only of attitudes that an agent &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; adopt (e.g. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can&quot;&gt;ought implies can&lt;/a&gt;”) whereas evaluative concepts can be affirmed independently of the agent’s abilities (p. 11); etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So clearly deontic concepts are at least prima-facie distinguishable from evaluative concepts, which would mean that the concept &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; is not the same as the concept &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. However, this alone does not imply that consequentialists are wrong to claim that the rightness of an action depends only on the goodness of certain consequences related to the action. Consequentialists can make this claim coherently, so long as they maintain that the dependence is not &lt;em&gt;conceptual&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. so long as they don’t argue that “right” &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; “good”, or that the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of either can be reduced to the &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; of the other. For example, hedonists do not make an error in &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; (although I would argue that they are nevertheless &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt;) when they claim that pleasure is the only intrinsic good. However, due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore-moral/#1&quot;&gt;Moore’s Open Question Argument&lt;/a&gt;, a hedonist &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; make an error in &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; if they claimed that “good” &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; the same thing as “pleasurable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that preliminaries are out of the way, we can get into why I believe consequentialism is wrong. First, I will show that consequentialism broadly can avoid most of the issues that plague utilitarianism (issues that I outlined in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/why-im-not-a-utilitarian/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;). This can be done with a less ambitious consequentialism that does not attempt to precisely specify either how collective goodness is to be measured or how collective goodness relates to one’s moral duties. However, I will then argue that even this less ambitious consequentialism should be rejected because there are special features relevant to the moral rightness of an action that cannot be reduced to the goodness of any consequences associated with the action. Ultimately, my argument will consist in appealing to intuitions (which I think are held by most reasonable people), which means the argument will not persuade a die-hard consequentialist who does not feel moved by the same intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-utilitarian-consequentialism&quot;&gt;Non-utilitarian consequentialism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/why-im-not-a-utilitarian/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I argued that classic utilitarianism (a particular form of consequentialism) should be rejected because some components of the theory are unreasonable. In this section, I consider whether consequentialism broadly can avoid those criticisms by abandoning these unreasonable components. To recap, I rejected utilitarianism because of the following components of the theory: &lt;em&gt;hedonism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;total consequentialism&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;agent-neutrality&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;equal consideration&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;actual consequentialism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maximizing consequentialism&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these components can be easily replaced under a different form of consequentialism. Consider the following examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hedonism can be replaced with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#TheWelBei&quot;&gt;different theory of well-being&lt;/a&gt;, such as e.g. a desire-theory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consequentialist theory can base moral rightness on &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;foreseeable&lt;/em&gt; consequences rather than &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; consequences, which is more plausible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A consequentialist theory can adopt an &lt;em&gt;agent-relative&lt;/em&gt; theory of goodness to avoid the problems with agent-neutrality and equal consideration. For example, ethical egoism is a fully agent-relative form of consequentialism that only gives weight to the goodness of the agent performing the action when determining the rightness of an action. Or, more plausibly, a consequentialist moral system can be partially agent-relative and partially agent-neutral. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.public.asu.edu/~dportmor/Consequentializing_Moral_Theories.pdf&quot;&gt;Douglas Portmore (2007, p. 11)&lt;/a&gt; describes a kind of consequentialism where agents can assign additional weight to their own utility while still taking into account the utility of others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while consequentialism can adequately handle those issues, it’s not clear to me if a consequentialist system can avoid all of the unreasonable components of utilitarianism. Specifically, it does not seem that a consequentialist system can replace &lt;em&gt;total consequentialism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maximizing consequentialism&lt;/em&gt; with adequate substitutes. I base this on the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While consequentialism need not adopt total consequentialist, it seems that alternatives may have equally damning flaws. For example, &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; consequentialism states that the goodness of a group depends on the average goodness of each individual. But on this theory, the world would be worsened by producing a life that is worse than the average life in the world, even if the new life is of very high quality and even if it doesn’t make anyone else worse off. This seems unintuitive; creating a life of very high quality that doesn’t harm anyone else is never bad. In general, I am skeptical that any consequentialist aggregation function can avoid extremely unintuitive conclusions. It seems that we lose important information when we try to measure the goodness of &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; individuals into a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional metric. I’m also suspicious of whether the concept of an “overall” or “collective” goodness - as something distinct from individual goodness - is even intelligible. For example, it might make sense to say that one state of affairs is &lt;em&gt;better for&lt;/em&gt; a particular group of people affected, and &lt;em&gt;worse for&lt;/em&gt; another group, but it does not seem sensible to say that it is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;. Partially, this is because I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.Relational.Good.pdf&quot;&gt;Christine Korsgaard (2013)&lt;/a&gt; that the concept of &lt;em&gt;good-for&lt;/em&gt; is prior to the notion of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; itself, or, in her own words, that “there is something essentially relational about the notion of the good itself” (although I don’t mean to imply that Korsgaard shares my skepticism of the notion of collective goodness).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is not clear whether a consequentialist theory could adequately replace the &lt;em&gt;maximizing component&lt;/em&gt; of utilitarianism with a suitable replacement. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/browse/maximizing-and-satisficing-consequentialism&quot;&gt;satisficing consequentialism&lt;/a&gt;, while perhaps allowing for supererogatory actions and moral options, might suffer similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/browse/demandingness-of-consequentialism&quot;&gt;demandingness issues&lt;/a&gt; as maximizing consequentialism. For example, if a large enough number of people are below some satisfactory threshold, and if the only way to bring others up to a satisfactory level is for one to make &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; personal sacrifices, then one would be morally obligated to make such sacrifices under satisficing consequentialism. This seems implausible. However, one response could be to adopt a proviso that agents are never morally obligated to make unreasonable sacrifices to themselves. I’m not sure how feasible this strategy is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am not confident that consequentialism can find suitable replacements for total and maximizing consequentialism. However, fortunately for consequentialists, consequentialism does &lt;em&gt;not need&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;replace&lt;/em&gt; these components. A less ambitious consequentialist could abandon those components and refuse to replace them. The only component of consequentialism that is &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; is the following proposition: &lt;em&gt;the moral rightness of an act depends only on the value (or goodness) of certain consequences associated with that act&lt;/em&gt;. However, a theory can adopt this principle without having a systematic method of &lt;em&gt;measuring&lt;/em&gt; collective goodness, or fleshing out in precise details the relationship between collective goodness and moral rightness. These are structural, systematic details which, while commonly associated with forms of consequentialism, are not required for consequentialism per se. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Particular-Consequentialism%3A-Why-Moral-and-Need-Olson-Svensson/d190f40e8e397869fe89463ab0f8932db211fc86https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Particular-Consequentialism%3A-Why-Moral-and-Need-Olson-Svensson/d190f40e8e397869fe89463ab0f8932db211fc86&quot;&gt;Olson and Svensson (2003)&lt;/a&gt; have even argued that one can simultaneously be both a consequentialist and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-particularism/&quot;&gt;particularist&lt;/a&gt;. For example, a consequentialist particularist might propose a list of consequentialist pro-tanto or prima-facie principles (similar to W.D. Ross’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/william-david-ross/#Rig&quot;&gt;prima-facie duties&lt;/a&gt;). One such list of consequentialist principles might include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Promotion.&lt;/em&gt; The good or lack of badness that obtains in the foreseeable outcome of an action (relative to alternative actions) contributes to the rightness of that action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harm Reduction&lt;/em&gt;. The badness or lack of good that obtains in the foreseeable outcome of an action (relative to alternative actions) contributes to the wrongness of that action.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritarianism&lt;/em&gt;. The goodness contributed to worse-off individuals contributes more to the amount of goodness in the world than equal amounts of goodness contributed to better-off individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agent-Relativity&lt;/em&gt;. The amount of goodness &lt;em&gt;relative to an agent&lt;/em&gt; in the intended or foreseeable outcome of an action contributes more towards the rightness of an action than the amount of &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;simpliciter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just possible consequentialist pro-tanto or prima-facie principles that I chose arbitrarily. A different consequentialist could select entirely different principles. They could remove some of the principles here, or they might add some new principles such as: the principle against producing harm takes priority over the principle of producing goodness, a large amount of small benefits is not as valuable as a small amount of big benefits, etc. A consequentialist might also say, like Ross’s prima-facie duties, that these principles can conflict, and that there is no higher principle to systematically settle which principle to follow in the case of such conflicts. Further, a consequentialist need not supply a method for measuring overall goodness. We might expect these methods from specific consequentialist “systems”, but they are not required for consequentialism &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. A less ambitious consequentialist theory that consists only of pro-tanto or prima-facie principles will remain purely consequentialist so long as the rightness of an action depends &lt;em&gt;only on&lt;/em&gt; the goodness of certain consequences associated with the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it seems like consequentialism &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; avoid all of the aforementioned problems that plagued utilitarianism. The question to be asked now is: are consequentialist principles the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; principles that determine the rightness of an act? Are there &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; instances where the moral rightness of an act depends on some special features &lt;em&gt;other than&lt;/em&gt; the goodness of certain outcomes associated with the act? As should be obvious from the title, I believe that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some such special features. I will list some of these special features in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features-relevant-to-the-right-but-not-to-the-good&quot;&gt;Features relevant to the right but not to the good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe consequentialism should be rejected because, sometimes, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; facts relevant to an action’s rightness other than just the goodness of the action’s consequences. These include special features related to either the agent performing the action or the agents affected by the action. These morally relevant special features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt; of the person(s) impacted by the action. Typically, for example, an agent has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; moral reason to alleviate serious harm to another person if the agent can do so by undergoing a “reasonable” sacrifice. However, if the person is &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for their harm, then this can reduce the agent’s reason or obligation to alleviate their harm, and this can reduce the level of sacrifice that the agent is obligated to endure. For example, if an agent has to choose between alleviating an identical burden from person A and person B, where person B is &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for needy situation and person A is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; responsible, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize alleviating the burden from person A.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desert/&quot;&gt;desert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the person(s) impacted by the action. Typically, for example, an agent has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; moral reason to provide a large benefit to another person if the agent can do so at a little or no cost to themselves. However, if the person is &lt;em&gt;deserving&lt;/em&gt; of that benefit, then this can be &lt;em&gt;amplify&lt;/em&gt; the agent’s reason to provide them the benefit. For example, if an agent has to choose between distributing an identical benefit to two different persons, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize distributing the benefit to the person who is more deserving of the benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;debts&lt;/em&gt; owed by the agent performing the action. Typically, for example, an agent has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; moral reason to alleviate serious harm to another person if the agent can do so by undergoing a “reasonable” sacrifice. However, if the agent has &lt;em&gt;wronged&lt;/em&gt; the person in the past, then this can &lt;em&gt;amplify&lt;/em&gt; the agent’s reason to alleviate the harm, and this can &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the level of sacrifice that the agent is obligated to endure. For example, if one has to choose between alleviating an identical burden from person A and person B, where person A’s burden was the result of being &lt;em&gt;wronged&lt;/em&gt; by the agent and person B’s burden has some other cause, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize alleviating the burden from person A.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;past agreements&lt;/em&gt; (consent, contracts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises&quot;&gt;promises&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) that have been made by person(s) involved in the action. Past agreements by agents can modify our moral obligations and moral permissions in at least two ways. For example, an agent’s moral obligation to alleviate the harms to a person can be &lt;em&gt;mitigated&lt;/em&gt; if the person previously consented to endure (or risk enduring) those harms. Or, an agent’s moral obligation to alleviate a certain harm can be &lt;em&gt;amplified&lt;/em&gt; if the agent previously agreed or promised to alleviate the harm.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/&quot;&gt;rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of the person(s) involved in the action. Two actions with the same amount of goodness/harm in their outcome may have different statuses as right/wrong if one action, but not the other, violates someone’s rights. For example, a certain action may be morally permissible in ordinary circumstances because it promotes a certain balance of goodness over harm, but a different action that produces the same balance of goodness over harm might not be morally permissible if it violates someone’s &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt;. Consider rights to bodily autonomy as one common example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;reasonableness&lt;/em&gt; of the interests of the person(s) affected by an action. When assessing the moral status of an action, the goodness/harm that would be produced from the fulfillment of an &lt;em&gt;unreasonable&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;illegitimate&lt;/em&gt; interest should not have as much weight as the same amount of goodness/harm that would be produced from the fulfillment of a reasonable interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibility&quot;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of the relevance of responsibility, consider imprisonment. Most people would agree that we should imprison &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt; suspects (i.e. criminals) for crimes but we should not imprison &lt;em&gt;innocent&lt;/em&gt; suspects. This is a clear case where the rightness and wrongness of certain actions (namely, the act of imprisoning a person) depends on facts about responsibility (namely, whether the person is &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for committing the relevant crime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consequentialist could object by saying that responsibility is not &lt;em&gt;intrinsically&lt;/em&gt; morally relevant in this case. Rather, responsibility is merely &lt;em&gt;instrumentally&lt;/em&gt; relevant. The consequentialist might say that the only factor that matters &lt;em&gt;intrinsically&lt;/em&gt; is the expected benefits that are produced by imprisoning the suspect, and whether a suspect is guilty of committing a crime conveys information about the expected benefits that would be produced by imprisoning him. For example, if Adam is guilty of recklessly killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence, then that raises the probability that he will produce similar harms in the future. Therefore, imprisoning Adam has the positive expected benefit of reducing such injuries and deaths in the future, and it has the expected benefit of rehabilitation and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while these benefits are definitely relevant, they are usually not &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; to justify imprisonment. Let’s assume that imprisoning Adam – the guilty drunk-driver – for 5 years is expected to prevent, say, 2 car accidents within the next 5 years because the number of potential drunk drivers on the road is reduced by 1. Now, imagine that we have a crystal ball that reveals that imprisoning Bob – a perfectly innocent driver – for 5 years will result in a slightly different flow of traffic which results in 2 fewer car accidents. It seems clear to me that it would be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; to imprison Bob in this example even though the benefits of doing so are comparable to the benefits of imprisoning Adam. This implies that benefits are (usually) not sufficient to justify imprisoning someone; the suspect must also be &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for committing the relevant crime (I say “usually” because the benefits may be sufficient in unusual circumstances, e.g. if imprisoning an innocent person somehow resulted in stopping a nuclear fallout). This means that &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt; is also relevant to the &lt;em&gt;rightness&lt;/em&gt; of an action independently of the benefit of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rights&quot;&gt;Rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example of the relevance of rights, consider actions that violate one’s bodily autonomy in order to produce a larger benefit for someone else. In ordinary situations, one might be justified in imposing a minor harm on someone in order to alleviate a more serious harm or to produce a major amount of good for others. For example, enacting a system of mandatory confiscation of wealth from the rich to be redistributed to the poor (i.e. taxation) seems morally justified because the goodness produced by the action far outweighs the harm produced by the action. However, similar reasoning does not apply when the action involves violating the bodily autonomy of the one who is harmed. For example, taking a kidney from a healthy person is a relatively minor harm compared to the benefit it might bestow on someone else (i.e. saving someone else’s life). However, it would nevertheless be morally wrong to enact a system of mandatory confiscation of kidneys from healthy people to be redistributed to unhealthy people. Such a system would be wrong even if we used a crystal ball to only confiscate kidneys from persons whom we knew would not need them in the future. What explains the different moral status of mandatory confiscation of wealth vs mandatory confiscation of bodily organs? The difference is related to the &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt; that persons have. People have &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt; to their bodily organs that are far stronger than any rights that they might have to their wealth (if people even have rights to their wealth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that none of this implies that rights can never be violated. The point is simply to note that whether an action would violate someone’s rights is a morally relevant consideration. This morally relevant consideration, of course, may be overridden by stronger moral considerations. For example, it would be morally right to take someone’s kidney in order to prevent the world from being destroyed, even though this would nevertheless violate that person’s right. The explanation for this is that the reasons against violating someone’s rights in this case are outweighed by the reasons in favor of preventing the world from being destroyed. However, in ordinary situations, the mere fact that an action produces more benefit than harm is not sufficient to justify violating someone’s rights (as the kidney example shows). This shows that we cannot merely consider the benefits and harms that would be produced by the action. Rights must also be taken into account when considering the moral rightness and wrongness of an action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unreasonable-interests&quot;&gt;Unreasonable interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of an unreasonable or illegitimate interest is the pleasure that a sadist takes in the unconsented suffering of others. Another example might be someone who unjustifiably believes that a particular group of people are inferior, which leads to this person judging that their dignity has been assaulted (resulting in a kind of subjective harm for that person) when he is treated equally as members of that group. Harms that are produced that stem from these unreasonable or illegitimate interests do not have as much weight as harms that stem from reasonable interests. Typically, unreasonable interests are interests that an agent &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have avoided holding (e.g. if they had a better upbringing and socialization), but this need not be a necessary condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more specific example of the importance of unreasonable interests, imagine we have the power to distribute valuable resources (e.g., money, food, health, etc.) to two individuals – Adam and Bob. Let’s also make a fairly reasonable assumption about Adam and Bob: the marginal benefit of each unit of resource decreases for both individuals as they acquire more total resources (diminishing returns). Now, let’s assume we have three scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In scenario 1, Adam and Bob are completely isolated from one another; neither individual has access to any information the other. Also, both individuals derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources. In this scenario, it seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute equal resources to both Adam and Bob. A consequentialist moral theory can explain this intuition because the only considerations that seem morally relevant in this situation are the benefits that would be produced for Adam and Bob by these valuable resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In scenario 2, Adam and Bob are again completely isolated from one another. But, unlike scenario 1, both individuals do not derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources. Adam requires slightly more resources than Bob in order to derive the same amount of goodness (i.e. well-being). The reason for this is that Adam needs slightly more resources to help him manage a physical disability caused by a genetic disorder. In this scenario, it seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute more resources to Adam. A consequentialist moral theory can explain this intuition because, again, the only considerations that seem morally relevant in this situation are the benefits that would be produced for Adam and Bob by these valuable resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In scenario 3, Adam and Bob are not isolated from each other. Like scenario 2, both individuals do not derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources; Adam requires slightly more resources than Bob in order to derive the same amount of goodness. But, unlike scenario 2, the reason for this is not that Adam has a physical disability; rather, Adam believes that Bob belongs to an inferior race and therefore would feel that his dignity has been assaulted (which causes some subjective suffering) if he is provided with equal resources as Bob. Adam will feel respected only if he is provided with substantially more resources than Bob. Because of Adam’s racist beliefs, slightly &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; goodness would be produced by giving slightly more resources to Adam at the expense of Bob; this strikes the perfect balance between raising goodness by appeasing Adam’s racist beliefs and raising goodness by providing resources to Bob. Despite this, it still seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute equal resources to both Adam and Bob; this might not maximize the amount of goodness because of Adam’s racist beliefs, but the goodness produced by Adam’s racist beliefs should not be given weight in this context because his racist beliefs are an &lt;em&gt;unreasonable&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;illegitimate&lt;/em&gt; interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;qualifications&quot;&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further examples shouldn’t be too difficult to imagine. Simply stipulate that two actions will produce identical distributions of goodness to a set of agents. Then further stipulate that the agents involved differ with respect to their responsibility, desert, rights violations, previous agreements or the reasonableness in their interests. If it seems that these differences constitute &lt;em&gt;morally relevant&lt;/em&gt; differences, then that is sufficient to show that these features are relevant to the rightness of actions in a way that doesn’t depend on their relation to the goodness of the action’s outcome. I have a few points to note about the features I mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This list is not exhaustive. Possibly, there are other morally relevant features that I have yet to think of. For example, in Thomas Scanlon’s &lt;em&gt;What We Owe to Each Other&lt;/em&gt;, Scanlon argues that the inherent &lt;em&gt;unfairness&lt;/em&gt; of an action can directly contribute to its wrongness, even if all alternative actions produce similar goods/harms (see the SEP &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/#ReaBeyWelBei&quot;&gt;entry on contractualism&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some of the features may be reducible to the other features mentioned there. For example, it seems plausible that the relevance of &lt;em&gt;desert&lt;/em&gt; can be explained in terms of the relevance of &lt;em&gt;responsibility&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, some even say that the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of desert is explained by the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of responsibility (although &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iep.utm.edu/desert/#SSH1ci&quot;&gt;this is debated&lt;/a&gt;). For another example, it also seems plausible that the relevance of responsibility and the relevance of past agreements can be explained in terms of the relevance of &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;. This post will remain agnostic about the irreducibility of these features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many of the features mentioned here are themselves moral (or, at least, normative) concepts. For example, there is no straightforward non-normative account of what it means for an agent to be “responsible”, to be “deserving”, to have certain “rights”, or for an interest to be “reasonable”. Likely, these would need to be defined according to some broader moral theory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, these features provide &lt;em&gt;pro-tanto&lt;/em&gt; reasons for or against the rightness/wrongness of an action; they do not provide &lt;em&gt;overriding&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;conclusive&lt;/em&gt; reasons. For example, the fact that an agent is responsible for the harm that they experience is a pro-tanto reason against others having a moral duty to alleviate that harm, but this can be overridden due to other moral considerations (e.g. the harm may be so large that we have a moral duty to assist them even if they’re fully responsible).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the features listed in this section constitute good reasons for abandoning consequentialism. These are all features that are relevant to the moral &lt;em&gt;rightness&lt;/em&gt; of an action even in cases where they are not relevant to the &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt; of any outcome associated with the action. If this is correct, then this suffices to show that the moral rightness of an action does not depend &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on the goodness of outcomes, which suffices to show that consequentialism is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few types of responses a consequentialist might give here. Firstly, one might move away from &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;-consequentialism to something like &lt;em&gt;rule-_consequentialism to account for the moral relevance of the aforementioned features under a consequentialist theory. I find this response unsatisfactory because (1) rule-consequentialism has its own &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iep.utm.edu/util-a-r/#SH4b&quot;&gt;set of objections&lt;/a&gt; which I hope to investigate in a future post; and (2) the aforementioned features are morally relevant under rule-consequentialism _only if&lt;/em&gt; certain rules respecting those features would increase the goodness of society, but it seems to me that those features would still be morally relevant &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; such rules had, say, a negligible impact on the goodness of society. Secondly, a consequentialist could &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; that these features are morally relevant if they have no impact on the goodness of an action’s outcome. I have no interest in entertaining such an absurd idea here. Finally, a consequentialist might insist that the features that I mentioned above are morally relevant &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are relevant to an action’s &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the consequentialist could provide a theory of goodness that makes direct reference to responsibility, desert, etc. I will consider this response in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keeping-the-right-and-the-good-separate&quot;&gt;Keeping the “right” and the “good” separate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reject the idea that we should build responsibility, desert, rights, respect for previous agreements, etc. into a theory of the &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. This, or something like this, is recommended by some consequentialists who believe that all moral theories can (and should) be “consequentialized”, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/12473535/BROWN_C_Consequentialize_This.pdf&quot;&gt;Campbell Brown (2011&lt;/a&gt;) has defined as follows: “To ‘consequentialize’ is to take a putatively nonconsequentialist moral theory and show that it is actually just another form of consequentialism.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.edu/academics/philosophy/sites/brown.edu.academics.philosophy/files/uploads/StructuresOfNormativeTheories_0.pdf&quot;&gt;James Dreier (1993, p. 23)&lt;/a&gt; states that “The main strategy for “consequentializing” any given moral theory” is to “take the features of an action that the theory considers to be relevant, and build them into the consequences”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this strategy is &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; feasible, I reject it because I don’t think responsibility, desert, respect for rights, etc. &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a part of a theory of goodness (i.e. they are not inherently relevant to the amount of goodness in the world). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.edu/academics/philosophy/sites/brown.edu.academics.philosophy/files/uploads/StructuresOfNormativeTheories_0.pdf&quot;&gt;John Dreier (1993, p. 24)&lt;/a&gt; has argued that to reject this strategy is actually &lt;em&gt;conceptually&lt;/em&gt; confused because he believes “every moral view is consequentialist”. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brown.edu/academics/philosophy/sites/brown.edu.academics.philosophy/files/uploads/Dreier%20In%20Defense%20of%20Consequentizling.pdf&quot;&gt;(2011)&lt;/a&gt; has argued that our concept of &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; is inextricably tied to our concept of &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;, so there cannot be any meaningful substantive divergence between them. In fact, he claims that if two theorists agree about what’s &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; but disagree about what’s &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, then this is merely a notational dispute. I believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://philarchive.org/archive/SCHCAI-11v1&quot;&gt;Schroeder (2017)&lt;/a&gt; has given a good rebuttal to Drier’s conceptual claim, but I won’t directly address this debate here. Instead, I’ll give an indirect argument against Dreier’s conceptual claim by arguing from intuitive moral judgments for why responsibility, desert, rights, etc. are not &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; related to the amount of goodness in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[premise] The amount of &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt; in the world is reducible to what is &lt;em&gt;good for&lt;/em&gt; each individual in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[premise] What is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; an individual is reducible to what contributes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/&quot;&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; of that individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[premise] Desire-satisfaction and/or happiness are the only features that are &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the well-being of an individual. All other features are merely &lt;em&gt;instrumentally&lt;/em&gt; relevant to well-being, contingent upon their ability to produce desire-satisfaction and/or happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[premise] Responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are not &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt; to any individual’s desire-satisfaction or happiness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[from 3 and 4] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; relevant to any individual’s well-being. Rather, they may be sometimes &lt;em&gt;instrumentally&lt;/em&gt; relevant to some individual’s well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[from 2 and 5] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; relevant to what is &lt;em&gt;good for&lt;/em&gt; an individual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[from 1 and 6] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never &lt;em&gt;inherently&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the amount of goodness in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the most controversial premise in this argument is premise 3, but even that is fairly uncontroversial. I think most people accept some form of desire-theory or happiness theory of well-being. This merely excludes certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#ObjLisThe&quot;&gt;objective-list&lt;/a&gt; theories of well-being which posit that certain factors are components of an individual’s well-being independently of that agent’s desires or happiness. I won’t argue this here because I take it that most find such objective-list theories to be fairly unintuitive. Assuming the other premises in the argument are true (which seems uncontroversial), it follows that responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are not inherently relevant to the amount of goodness in the world. But, if the earlier points in this post are correct, these features &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; relevant to the rightness of an action. Thus, these features would demonstrate that there are features relevant to the rightness of an action which are not relevant to the goodness associated with that action. This suffices to show that consequentialism should be abandoned. An alternative moral system should be adopted to account for a more complete range of all morally relevant features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;further-questions&quot;&gt;Further Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some issues that have been touched on here that I hope to explore further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I expressed my skepticism that the concept of an “overall” or “collective” goodness is intelligible. I hope to elaborate on why I believe this in a future post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would like to provide an explanation for why the moral features that I listed - responsibility, desert, previous agreements, rights, interest reasonableness - are morally relevant. Likely, this will involve appealing to some broader moral theory, which leads to my next point.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If consequentialism is not a viable option as a moral theory, I should investigate an adequate replacement. I’m currently inclined towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&quot;&gt;contractualism&lt;/a&gt;, which (I believe) explains the intrinsic moral relevance of some of the aforementioned moral features and which captures the way most people engage in moral reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Following the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), consequentialism is a moral theory that states that the moral rightness of an act depends only on the goodness of certain consequences associated with the act. There are many different consequentialist systems, e.g. ethical egoism vs utilitarianism, act-consequentialism vs rule-consequentialism, etc. What consequentialist views share in common is that they take facts about the “right” to depend only on facts about the “good”. This is sometimes expressed by saying that the “good” is prior to the “right”. In other words, once we know about the goodness of certain consequences associated with an act (or rules permitting the act), we have all the information necessary to determine the moral rightness of the act. This is unlike non-consequentialists such as Rawls or Kant who believe that the “right” to be in some ways prior to the “good”, or at least that the “right” is separate from the “good”. I agree with Rawls and Kant in this respect. Consequentialists are incorrect to state that facts about the “right” depend only on facts about the “good”. While the goodness of consequences is certainly relevant to determining the rightness of an action, I will argue in this post that there are additional features that are morally relevant as well. Before getting to the argument, we must first understand what is meant by “good” and “right”. The “right” and the “good” as distinct concepts One’s immediate reaction to hearing that the “right” is prior to the “good” might be confusion. After all, don’t “good” and “right” pretty much express the same concept? They are both normative concepts that are ascribed to things that are in some way desirable or favorable, so in what sense can one be prior to the other? The “right” and the “good” might be related, but it can be shown that they do not express the same concept because they don’t have the same meaning. They do not have the same meaning because the terms cannot be substituted with one another in a sentence without altering the meaning of the sentence. In the chapter “The Meaning of Right” from William David Ross’s book The Right and the Good - which is “arguably one of the most important works of moral philosophy published in the twentieth century” according to the SEP entry on the author - Ross (1930) argued famously that the right and the good have different meanings: It seems to me clear that ‘right’ does not mean the same as ‘morally good’; and we can test this by trying to substitute one for the other. If they meant the same thing we should be able to substitute, for instance, ‘he is a right man’ for ‘he is a morally good man’; nor is our inability to do this merely a matter of English idiom, for if we turn to the sort of moral judgement in which we do use the word ‘right_, such as ‘this is the right act, it is clear that by this we mean ‘this act is the act _that ought to be done’, ‘this act is morally obligatory’; and to substitute either of these phrases for ‘morally good’ in ‘he is a morally good man’ would obviously be not merely unidiomatic, but absurd. It should be obvious, then, that ‘right’ and ‘morally good’ mean different things. The differences between the concept of right and the concept of good can be illustrated by contrasting the two normative classes that these concepts respectively belong to. Right is a deontic concept whereas good is an evaluative concept. Deontic concepts include normative concepts such as right, wrong, duty, ought, reason, must, warrant, permitted, prohibited, etc. Evaluative concepts include normative concepts such as good, bad, noble, desirable, admirable, worthy, etc. Christine Tappolet (2014) has highlighted some of the key distinctions between deontic and evaluative concepts (p. 1): The concepts that count as normative can appear quite heterogenous. However, some groupings seem natural. Thus, it is generally admitted that we can divide these concepts into two large distinct groups: evaluative or axiological concepts (from the latin valores or the Greek axos, both meaning that which has worth), such as good and bad, and deontic concepts (from the Greek deon, meaning that which is binding), such as obligatory and permissible… The distinction between evaluative and deontic consists in a generalisation of the traditional opposition between the good and the right . Throughout the paper, she highlights a number of distinctions between the two conceptual families. Some examples include the following: the fact that we can make logical inference within either family but we can not (obviously) make such inference across families (p. 4); the fact that evaluative concepts can be applied to a wider range of things (e.g. actions, persons, objects, states of affairs can all be good, bad, admirable, etc.) whereas deontic concepts are typically restricted to what is subject to the will of an agent (p. 10); the fact that deontic concepts are typically affirmed only of attitudes that an agent can adopt (e.g. “ought implies can”) whereas evaluative concepts can be affirmed independently of the agent’s abilities (p. 11); etc. So clearly deontic concepts are at least prima-facie distinguishable from evaluative concepts, which would mean that the concept right is not the same as the concept good. However, this alone does not imply that consequentialists are wrong to claim that the rightness of an action depends only on the goodness of certain consequences related to the action. Consequentialists can make this claim coherently, so long as they maintain that the dependence is not conceptual, i.e. so long as they don’t argue that “right” means “good”, or that the meaning of either can be reduced to the meaning of the other. For example, hedonists do not make an error in meaning (although I would argue that they are nevertheless incorrect) when they claim that pleasure is the only intrinsic good. However, due to Moore’s Open Question Argument, a hedonist would make an error in meaning if they claimed that “good” means the same thing as “pleasurable”. Now that preliminaries are out of the way, we can get into why I believe consequentialism is wrong. First, I will show that consequentialism broadly can avoid most of the issues that plague utilitarianism (issues that I outlined in a previous post). This can be done with a less ambitious consequentialism that does not attempt to precisely specify either how collective goodness is to be measured or how collective goodness relates to one’s moral duties. However, I will then argue that even this less ambitious consequentialism should be rejected because there are special features relevant to the moral rightness of an action that cannot be reduced to the goodness of any consequences associated with the action. Ultimately, my argument will consist in appealing to intuitions (which I think are held by most reasonable people), which means the argument will not persuade a die-hard consequentialist who does not feel moved by the same intuitions. Non-utilitarian consequentialism In a previous post, I argued that classic utilitarianism (a particular form of consequentialism) should be rejected because some components of the theory are unreasonable. In this section, I consider whether consequentialism broadly can avoid those criticisms by abandoning these unreasonable components. To recap, I rejected utilitarianism because of the following components of the theory: hedonism, total consequentialism, agent-neutrality, equal consideration, actual consequentialism and maximizing consequentialism. Some of these components can be easily replaced under a different form of consequentialism. Consider the following examples. Hedonism can be replaced with a different theory of well-being, such as e.g. a desire-theory. A consequentialist theory can base moral rightness on intended or foreseeable consequences rather than actual consequences, which is more plausible. A consequentialist theory can adopt an agent-relative theory of goodness to avoid the problems with agent-neutrality and equal consideration. For example, ethical egoism is a fully agent-relative form of consequentialism that only gives weight to the goodness of the agent performing the action when determining the rightness of an action. Or, more plausibly, a consequentialist moral system can be partially agent-relative and partially agent-neutral. For example, Douglas Portmore (2007, p. 11) describes a kind of consequentialism where agents can assign additional weight to their own utility while still taking into account the utility of others. However, while consequentialism can adequately handle those issues, it’s not clear to me if a consequentialist system can avoid all of the unreasonable components of utilitarianism. Specifically, it does not seem that a consequentialist system can replace total consequentialism and maximizing consequentialism with adequate substitutes. I base this on the following reasons. While consequentialism need not adopt total consequentialist, it seems that alternatives may have equally damning flaws. For example, average consequentialism states that the goodness of a group depends on the average goodness of each individual. But on this theory, the world would be worsened by producing a life that is worse than the average life in the world, even if the new life is of very high quality and even if it doesn’t make anyone else worse off. This seems unintuitive; creating a life of very high quality that doesn’t harm anyone else is never bad. In general, I am skeptical that any consequentialist aggregation function can avoid extremely unintuitive conclusions. It seems that we lose important information when we try to measure the goodness of multiple individuals into a single-dimensional metric. I’m also suspicious of whether the concept of an “overall” or “collective” goodness - as something distinct from individual goodness - is even intelligible. For example, it might make sense to say that one state of affairs is better for a particular group of people affected, and worse for another group, but it does not seem sensible to say that it is better simpliciter. Partially, this is because I agree with Christine Korsgaard (2013) that the concept of good-for is prior to the notion of good itself, or, in her own words, that “there is something essentially relational about the notion of the good itself” (although I don’t mean to imply that Korsgaard shares my skepticism of the notion of collective goodness). It is not clear whether a consequentialist theory could adequately replace the maximizing component of utilitarianism with a suitable replacement. For example, satisficing consequentialism, while perhaps allowing for supererogatory actions and moral options, might suffer similar demandingness issues as maximizing consequentialism. For example, if a large enough number of people are below some satisfactory threshold, and if the only way to bring others up to a satisfactory level is for one to make extreme personal sacrifices, then one would be morally obligated to make such sacrifices under satisficing consequentialism. This seems implausible. However, one response could be to adopt a proviso that agents are never morally obligated to make unreasonable sacrifices to themselves. I’m not sure how feasible this strategy is. So I am not confident that consequentialism can find suitable replacements for total and maximizing consequentialism. However, fortunately for consequentialists, consequentialism does not need to replace these components. A less ambitious consequentialist could abandon those components and refuse to replace them. The only component of consequentialism that is essential is the following proposition: the moral rightness of an act depends only on the value (or goodness) of certain consequences associated with that act. However, a theory can adopt this principle without having a systematic method of measuring collective goodness, or fleshing out in precise details the relationship between collective goodness and moral rightness. These are structural, systematic details which, while commonly associated with forms of consequentialism, are not required for consequentialism per se. In fact, Olson and Svensson (2003) have even argued that one can simultaneously be both a consequentialist and a particularist. For example, a consequentialist particularist might propose a list of consequentialist pro-tanto or prima-facie principles (similar to W.D. Ross’s prima-facie duties). One such list of consequentialist principles might include the following: Good Promotion. The good or lack of badness that obtains in the foreseeable outcome of an action (relative to alternative actions) contributes to the rightness of that action. Harm Reduction. The badness or lack of good that obtains in the foreseeable outcome of an action (relative to alternative actions) contributes to the wrongness of that action. Prioritarianism. The goodness contributed to worse-off individuals contributes more to the amount of goodness in the world than equal amounts of goodness contributed to better-off individuals. Agent-Relativity. The amount of goodness relative to an agent in the intended or foreseeable outcome of an action contributes more towards the rightness of an action than the amount of goodness simpliciter. These are just possible consequentialist pro-tanto or prima-facie principles that I chose arbitrarily. A different consequentialist could select entirely different principles. They could remove some of the principles here, or they might add some new principles such as: the principle against producing harm takes priority over the principle of producing goodness, a large amount of small benefits is not as valuable as a small amount of big benefits, etc. A consequentialist might also say, like Ross’s prima-facie duties, that these principles can conflict, and that there is no higher principle to systematically settle which principle to follow in the case of such conflicts. Further, a consequentialist need not supply a method for measuring overall goodness. We might expect these methods from specific consequentialist “systems”, but they are not required for consequentialism per se. A less ambitious consequentialist theory that consists only of pro-tanto or prima-facie principles will remain purely consequentialist so long as the rightness of an action depends only on the goodness of certain consequences associated with the action. So it seems like consequentialism can avoid all of the aforementioned problems that plagued utilitarianism. The question to be asked now is: are consequentialist principles the only principles that determine the rightness of an act? Are there ever instances where the moral rightness of an act depends on some special features other than the goodness of certain outcomes associated with the act? As should be obvious from the title, I believe that there are some such special features. I will list some of these special features in the next section. Features relevant to the right but not to the good I believe consequentialism should be rejected because, sometimes, there are facts relevant to an action’s rightness other than just the goodness of the action’s consequences. These include special features related to either the agent performing the action or the agents affected by the action. These morally relevant special features include: The responsibility of the person(s) impacted by the action. Typically, for example, an agent has some moral reason to alleviate serious harm to another person if the agent can do so by undergoing a “reasonable” sacrifice. However, if the person is responsible for their harm, then this can reduce the agent’s reason or obligation to alleviate their harm, and this can reduce the level of sacrifice that the agent is obligated to endure. For example, if an agent has to choose between alleviating an identical burden from person A and person B, where person B is responsible for needy situation and person A is not responsible, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize alleviating the burden from person A. The desert of the person(s) impacted by the action. Typically, for example, an agent has some moral reason to provide a large benefit to another person if the agent can do so at a little or no cost to themselves. However, if the person is deserving of that benefit, then this can be amplify the agent’s reason to provide them the benefit. For example, if an agent has to choose between distributing an identical benefit to two different persons, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize distributing the benefit to the person who is more deserving of the benefit. The debts owed by the agent performing the action. Typically, for example, an agent has some moral reason to alleviate serious harm to another person if the agent can do so by undergoing a “reasonable” sacrifice. However, if the agent has wronged the person in the past, then this can amplify the agent’s reason to alleviate the harm, and this can increase the level of sacrifice that the agent is obligated to endure. For example, if one has to choose between alleviating an identical burden from person A and person B, where person A’s burden was the result of being wronged by the agent and person B’s burden has some other cause, then (assuming all else is equal) the agent should prioritize alleviating the burden from person A. The past agreements (consent, contracts, promises, etc.) that have been made by person(s) involved in the action. Past agreements by agents can modify our moral obligations and moral permissions in at least two ways. For example, an agent’s moral obligation to alleviate the harms to a person can be mitigated if the person previously consented to endure (or risk enduring) those harms. Or, an agent’s moral obligation to alleviate a certain harm can be amplified if the agent previously agreed or promised to alleviate the harm. The rights of the person(s) involved in the action. Two actions with the same amount of goodness/harm in their outcome may have different statuses as right/wrong if one action, but not the other, violates someone’s rights. For example, a certain action may be morally permissible in ordinary circumstances because it promotes a certain balance of goodness over harm, but a different action that produces the same balance of goodness over harm might not be morally permissible if it violates someone’s rights. Consider rights to bodily autonomy as one common example. The reasonableness of the interests of the person(s) affected by an action. When assessing the moral status of an action, the goodness/harm that would be produced from the fulfillment of an unreasonable or illegitimate interest should not have as much weight as the same amount of goodness/harm that would be produced from the fulfillment of a reasonable interest. Responsibility For an example of the relevance of responsibility, consider imprisonment. Most people would agree that we should imprison guilty suspects (i.e. criminals) for crimes but we should not imprison innocent suspects. This is a clear case where the rightness and wrongness of certain actions (namely, the act of imprisoning a person) depends on facts about responsibility (namely, whether the person is responsible for committing the relevant crime). A consequentialist could object by saying that responsibility is not intrinsically morally relevant in this case. Rather, responsibility is merely instrumentally relevant. The consequentialist might say that the only factor that matters intrinsically is the expected benefits that are produced by imprisoning the suspect, and whether a suspect is guilty of committing a crime conveys information about the expected benefits that would be produced by imprisoning him. For example, if Adam is guilty of recklessly killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence, then that raises the probability that he will produce similar harms in the future. Therefore, imprisoning Adam has the positive expected benefit of reducing such injuries and deaths in the future, and it has the expected benefit of rehabilitation and deterrence. However, while these benefits are definitely relevant, they are usually not sufficient to justify imprisonment. Let’s assume that imprisoning Adam – the guilty drunk-driver – for 5 years is expected to prevent, say, 2 car accidents within the next 5 years because the number of potential drunk drivers on the road is reduced by 1. Now, imagine that we have a crystal ball that reveals that imprisoning Bob – a perfectly innocent driver – for 5 years will result in a slightly different flow of traffic which results in 2 fewer car accidents. It seems clear to me that it would be wrong to imprison Bob in this example even though the benefits of doing so are comparable to the benefits of imprisoning Adam. This implies that benefits are (usually) not sufficient to justify imprisoning someone; the suspect must also be responsible for committing the relevant crime (I say “usually” because the benefits may be sufficient in unusual circumstances, e.g. if imprisoning an innocent person somehow resulted in stopping a nuclear fallout). This means that responsibility is also relevant to the rightness of an action independently of the benefit of the action. Rights For an example of the relevance of rights, consider actions that violate one’s bodily autonomy in order to produce a larger benefit for someone else. In ordinary situations, one might be justified in imposing a minor harm on someone in order to alleviate a more serious harm or to produce a major amount of good for others. For example, enacting a system of mandatory confiscation of wealth from the rich to be redistributed to the poor (i.e. taxation) seems morally justified because the goodness produced by the action far outweighs the harm produced by the action. However, similar reasoning does not apply when the action involves violating the bodily autonomy of the one who is harmed. For example, taking a kidney from a healthy person is a relatively minor harm compared to the benefit it might bestow on someone else (i.e. saving someone else’s life). However, it would nevertheless be morally wrong to enact a system of mandatory confiscation of kidneys from healthy people to be redistributed to unhealthy people. Such a system would be wrong even if we used a crystal ball to only confiscate kidneys from persons whom we knew would not need them in the future. What explains the different moral status of mandatory confiscation of wealth vs mandatory confiscation of bodily organs? The difference is related to the rights that persons have. People have rights to their bodily organs that are far stronger than any rights that they might have to their wealth (if people even have rights to their wealth). Keep in mind that none of this implies that rights can never be violated. The point is simply to note that whether an action would violate someone’s rights is a morally relevant consideration. This morally relevant consideration, of course, may be overridden by stronger moral considerations. For example, it would be morally right to take someone’s kidney in order to prevent the world from being destroyed, even though this would nevertheless violate that person’s right. The explanation for this is that the reasons against violating someone’s rights in this case are outweighed by the reasons in favor of preventing the world from being destroyed. However, in ordinary situations, the mere fact that an action produces more benefit than harm is not sufficient to justify violating someone’s rights (as the kidney example shows). This shows that we cannot merely consider the benefits and harms that would be produced by the action. Rights must also be taken into account when considering the moral rightness and wrongness of an action. Unreasonable interests One example of an unreasonable or illegitimate interest is the pleasure that a sadist takes in the unconsented suffering of others. Another example might be someone who unjustifiably believes that a particular group of people are inferior, which leads to this person judging that their dignity has been assaulted (resulting in a kind of subjective harm for that person) when he is treated equally as members of that group. Harms that are produced that stem from these unreasonable or illegitimate interests do not have as much weight as harms that stem from reasonable interests. Typically, unreasonable interests are interests that an agent could have avoided holding (e.g. if they had a better upbringing and socialization), but this need not be a necessary condition. For a more specific example of the importance of unreasonable interests, imagine we have the power to distribute valuable resources (e.g., money, food, health, etc.) to two individuals – Adam and Bob. Let’s also make a fairly reasonable assumption about Adam and Bob: the marginal benefit of each unit of resource decreases for both individuals as they acquire more total resources (diminishing returns). Now, let’s assume we have three scenarios: In scenario 1, Adam and Bob are completely isolated from one another; neither individual has access to any information the other. Also, both individuals derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources. In this scenario, it seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute equal resources to both Adam and Bob. A consequentialist moral theory can explain this intuition because the only considerations that seem morally relevant in this situation are the benefits that would be produced for Adam and Bob by these valuable resources. In scenario 2, Adam and Bob are again completely isolated from one another. But, unlike scenario 1, both individuals do not derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources. Adam requires slightly more resources than Bob in order to derive the same amount of goodness (i.e. well-being). The reason for this is that Adam needs slightly more resources to help him manage a physical disability caused by a genetic disorder. In this scenario, it seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute more resources to Adam. A consequentialist moral theory can explain this intuition because, again, the only considerations that seem morally relevant in this situation are the benefits that would be produced for Adam and Bob by these valuable resources. In scenario 3, Adam and Bob are not isolated from each other. Like scenario 2, both individuals do not derive equal benefit from the same amount of resources; Adam requires slightly more resources than Bob in order to derive the same amount of goodness. But, unlike scenario 2, the reason for this is not that Adam has a physical disability; rather, Adam believes that Bob belongs to an inferior race and therefore would feel that his dignity has been assaulted (which causes some subjective suffering) if he is provided with equal resources as Bob. Adam will feel respected only if he is provided with substantially more resources than Bob. Because of Adam’s racist beliefs, slightly more goodness would be produced by giving slightly more resources to Adam at the expense of Bob; this strikes the perfect balance between raising goodness by appeasing Adam’s racist beliefs and raising goodness by providing resources to Bob. Despite this, it still seems plausible that the morally right action is to distribute equal resources to both Adam and Bob; this might not maximize the amount of goodness because of Adam’s racist beliefs, but the goodness produced by Adam’s racist beliefs should not be given weight in this context because his racist beliefs are an unreasonable or illegitimate interest. Qualifications Further examples shouldn’t be too difficult to imagine. Simply stipulate that two actions will produce identical distributions of goodness to a set of agents. Then further stipulate that the agents involved differ with respect to their responsibility, desert, rights violations, previous agreements or the reasonableness in their interests. If it seems that these differences constitute morally relevant differences, then that is sufficient to show that these features are relevant to the rightness of actions in a way that doesn’t depend on their relation to the goodness of the action’s outcome. I have a few points to note about the features I mentioned: This list is not exhaustive. Possibly, there are other morally relevant features that I have yet to think of. For example, in Thomas Scanlon’s What We Owe to Each Other, Scanlon argues that the inherent unfairness of an action can directly contribute to its wrongness, even if all alternative actions produce similar goods/harms (see the SEP entry on contractualism). Some of the features may be reducible to the other features mentioned there. For example, it seems plausible that the relevance of desert can be explained in terms of the relevance of responsibility. Indeed, some even say that the concept of desert is explained by the concept of responsibility (although this is debated). For another example, it also seems plausible that the relevance of responsibility and the relevance of past agreements can be explained in terms of the relevance of choice. This post will remain agnostic about the irreducibility of these features. Many of the features mentioned here are themselves moral (or, at least, normative) concepts. For example, there is no straightforward non-normative account of what it means for an agent to be “responsible”, to be “deserving”, to have certain “rights”, or for an interest to be “reasonable”. Likely, these would need to be defined according to some broader moral theory. Finally, these features provide pro-tanto reasons for or against the rightness/wrongness of an action; they do not provide overriding or conclusive reasons. For example, the fact that an agent is responsible for the harm that they experience is a pro-tanto reason against others having a moral duty to alleviate that harm, but this can be overridden due to other moral considerations (e.g. the harm may be so large that we have a moral duty to assist them even if they’re fully responsible). I believe that the features listed in this section constitute good reasons for abandoning consequentialism. These are all features that are relevant to the moral rightness of an action even in cases where they are not relevant to the goodness of any outcome associated with the action. If this is correct, then this suffices to show that the moral rightness of an action does not depend only on the goodness of outcomes, which suffices to show that consequentialism is false. There are a few types of responses a consequentialist might give here. Firstly, one might move away from act-consequentialism to something like rule-_consequentialism to account for the moral relevance of the aforementioned features under a consequentialist theory. I find this response unsatisfactory because (1) rule-consequentialism has its own set of objections which I hope to investigate in a future post; and (2) the aforementioned features are morally relevant under rule-consequentialism _only if certain rules respecting those features would increase the goodness of society, but it seems to me that those features would still be morally relevant even if such rules had, say, a negligible impact on the goodness of society. Secondly, a consequentialist could deny that these features are morally relevant if they have no impact on the goodness of an action’s outcome. I have no interest in entertaining such an absurd idea here. Finally, a consequentialist might insist that the features that I mentioned above are morally relevant because they are relevant to an action’s goodness. For example, the consequentialist could provide a theory of goodness that makes direct reference to responsibility, desert, etc. I will consider this response in the next section. Keeping the “right” and the “good” separate I reject the idea that we should build responsibility, desert, rights, respect for previous agreements, etc. into a theory of the good. This, or something like this, is recommended by some consequentialists who believe that all moral theories can (and should) be “consequentialized”, which Campbell Brown (2011) has defined as follows: “To ‘consequentialize’ is to take a putatively nonconsequentialist moral theory and show that it is actually just another form of consequentialism.” James Dreier (1993, p. 23) states that “The main strategy for “consequentializing” any given moral theory” is to “take the features of an action that the theory considers to be relevant, and build them into the consequences”. While this strategy is technically feasible, I reject it because I don’t think responsibility, desert, respect for rights, etc. should be a part of a theory of goodness (i.e. they are not inherently relevant to the amount of goodness in the world). John Dreier (1993, p. 24) has argued that to reject this strategy is actually conceptually confused because he believes “every moral view is consequentialist”. He (2011) has argued that our concept of good is inextricably tied to our concept of right, so there cannot be any meaningful substantive divergence between them. In fact, he claims that if two theorists agree about what’s right but disagree about what’s good, then this is merely a notational dispute. I believe that Schroeder (2017) has given a good rebuttal to Drier’s conceptual claim, but I won’t directly address this debate here. Instead, I’ll give an indirect argument against Dreier’s conceptual claim by arguing from intuitive moral judgments for why responsibility, desert, rights, etc. are not inherently related to the amount of goodness in the world. [premise] The amount of goodness in the world is reducible to what is good for each individual in the world. [premise] What is good for an individual is reducible to what contributes to the well-being of that individual. [premise] Desire-satisfaction and/or happiness are the only features that are inherently relevant to the well-being of an individual. All other features are merely instrumentally relevant to well-being, contingent upon their ability to produce desire-satisfaction and/or happiness. [premise] Responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are not identical to any individual’s desire-satisfaction or happiness. [from 3 and 4] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never inherently relevant to any individual’s well-being. Rather, they may be sometimes instrumentally relevant to some individual’s well-being. [from 2 and 5] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never inherently relevant to what is good for an individual. [from 1 and 6] Therefore, responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are never inherently relevant to the amount of goodness in the world. I believe that the most controversial premise in this argument is premise 3, but even that is fairly uncontroversial. I think most people accept some form of desire-theory or happiness theory of well-being. This merely excludes certain objective-list theories of well-being which posit that certain factors are components of an individual’s well-being independently of that agent’s desires or happiness. I won’t argue this here because I take it that most find such objective-list theories to be fairly unintuitive. Assuming the other premises in the argument are true (which seems uncontroversial), it follows that responsibility, desert, promises, etc. are not inherently relevant to the amount of goodness in the world. But, if the earlier points in this post are correct, these features are relevant to the rightness of an action. Thus, these features would demonstrate that there are features relevant to the rightness of an action which are not relevant to the goodness associated with that action. This suffices to show that consequentialism should be abandoned. An alternative moral system should be adopted to account for a more complete range of all morally relevant features. Further Questions Some issues that have been touched on here that I hope to explore further in the future. I expressed my skepticism that the concept of an “overall” or “collective” goodness is intelligible. I hope to elaborate on why I believe this in a future post. I would like to provide an explanation for why the moral features that I listed - responsibility, desert, previous agreements, rights, interest reasonableness - are morally relevant. Likely, this will involve appealing to some broader moral theory, which leads to my next point. If consequentialism is not a viable option as a moral theory, I should investigate an adequate replacement. I’m currently inclined towards contractualism, which (I believe) explains the intrinsic moral relevance of some of the aforementioned moral features and which captures the way most people engage in moral reasoning.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on &lt;em&gt;consequences&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to the circumstances or the intrinsic nature of the act or anything that happens before the act).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evaluative Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the consequences (as opposed to non-evaluative features of the consequences).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actual Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; consequences (as opposed to foreseen, foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of &lt;em&gt;that act itself&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to the consequences of the agent’s motive, of a rule or practice that covers other acts of the same kind, and so on).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximizing Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on which consequences are &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; (as opposed to merely satisfactory or an improvement over the status quo).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aggregative Consequentialism = which consequences are best is some function of the values of &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt; of those consequences (as opposed to rankings of whole worlds or sets of consequences).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average net good per person).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Universal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends on the consequences for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; people or sentient beings (as opposed to only the individual agent, members of the individual’s society, present people, or any other limited group).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Equal Consideration = in determining moral rightness, benefits to one person matter &lt;em&gt;just as much&lt;/em&gt; as similar benefits to any other person (as opposed to putting more weight on the worse or worst off).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agent-neutrality = whether some consequences are better than others does not depend on whether the consequences are evaluated from the perspective of the agent (as opposed to an observer).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hedonism = the value of the consequences depends only on the &lt;em&gt;pleasures&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pains&lt;/em&gt; in the consequences (as opposed to other supposed goods, such as freedom, knowledge, life, and so on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I refer to “utilitarianism”, I will be referring to this narrow definition. Utilitarianism, like most consequentialist moral theories, can be broken down into two broad components: (1) a theory of goodness, and (2) a theory of how the goodness of the outcome of an act relates to that act’s rightness. Utilitarianism says that (1) goodness is constituted by the total summation of the pleasure over pain of all sentient creatures where each creature is given equal consideration, and (2) an act is right if and only if the actual consequences of that act have more goodness than any other alternative. Further, I believe that a theory of goodness can be broken down into two subcomponents: (1a) a theory of &lt;em&gt;individual goodness&lt;/em&gt;, and (1b) a theory of how the goodness of individuals relates to the &lt;em&gt;collective&lt;/em&gt; goodness (e.g. using some sort of aggregation function). Utilitarianism says that (1a) individual goodness is constituted by the total amount of pleasure and pain for that individual, and (1b) the collective goodness is simply the total summation of every sentient creature’s individual goodness. In this post, I will criticize each of these three components of utilitarianism. These criticisms, I believe, provide sufficient reason to reject utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;individual-goodness&quot;&gt;Individual goodness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most unattractive features of utilitarianism is its theory of individual goodness: &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/&quot;&gt;hedonism&lt;/a&gt;. Hedonism states that the value or goodness of our lives depends only on the pleasure and pain that we experience. I reject hedonism because it advocates performing the action that produces the most pleasure even when this conflicts with one’s strongest goals and plans in life. For example, imagine that there exists a special drug such that consuming the drug for the rest of one’s life was the best way to maximize the expected amount of pleasure one would experience. However, anyone who takes the drug becomes severely addicted and is rendered unable to pursue any of their other goals or plans in life; the rest of their life is spent in either inebriation or acquiring resources necessary to gather additional drugs to restore their inebriated state. Now imagine someone is given the opportunity to chose whether to consume the drug (also assume that their decision has no significant impact on other people, to avoid complications due to moral considerations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this individual &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have more reason to decline to consume the drug, assuming he had other goals that he considered more important than the pleasure that would be produced by this drug, e.g. goals related to his career, projects, hobbies, etc. (I say “could” rather than “would” because presumably there &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be circumstances where an individual actually had more reason to consume the drug). However, this doesn’t quite make sense under hedonism. Hedonism states that the best life is the one with more pleasure over pain, and presumably we have most reason (absent moral considerations) to make our lives go best. Thus, if hedonism were true, it could not be the case that the individual could have more reason to refrain from taking the drug since, by hypothesis, taking this drug would produce the highest expected amount of pleasure and (therefore) good for that person. For this reason, I believe a proper theory of individual goodness should be some sort of refined desire theory, where goodness for an agent is constituted by the satisfaction of that agent’s fully informed and fully rational desires. More specifically, I believe I proper theory of individual goodness should be based on what an agent has &lt;em&gt;reason&lt;/em&gt; to desire, where an agent’s reasons (&lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/reasons-internalism-an-argument-from-theoretical-reasons/&quot;&gt;as I’ve argued here&lt;/a&gt;) are the rational extension of an agent’s motivational set (motivational set includes elements such as desires, values, goals, plans, normative judgments, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aggregation-function&quot;&gt;Aggregation Function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s assume we have a perfect theory of individual goodness. Let’s consider the aggregation function that utilitarianism endorses, i.e. let’s see what utilitarianism says about the relationship between (a) the goodness of &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; of the lives of the individual members of a group and (b) the overall goodness of the group as a whole. Following SEP, the aggregation function used by utilitarianism states that the relationship between individual goodness and collective goodness has the following components: Aggregative Consequentialism, Total Consequentialism, Universal Consequentialism, Equal Consideration, and Agent-neutrality. I reject utilitarianism’s aggregation function as I reject Total Consequentialism, Equal Consideration and Agent-neutrality. I will first consider Total Consequentialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Consequentialism states moral rightness depends only on the &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average net good per person). There are at least two objections to consequentialist theories that identify goodness with the summation of the individual goodness of each member in a group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first objection involves the possibility of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster&quot;&gt;utility monsters&lt;/a&gt;. Utility monsters are beings that produce far more value (according on one’s preferred theory of individual goodness, etc. narrow hedonism, preference hedonism, desire-satisfaction, etc.) for each unit of resources they consume than anyone else. For example, if there is a utility monster, then it would be best to give it all of our food even if it results in our starvation. Intuitively, this seems incorrect; it would be extremely bad if we all starved even if it produced an extreme amount of value in another being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A second objection is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/&quot;&gt;Repugnant Conclusion&lt;/a&gt; presented by Derick Parfit. The basic idea is that, if we accept Total Consequentialism, then “For any possible population of at least ten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there must be some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if other things are equal, would be better even though its members have lives that are barely worth living”. In other words, a large number of individuals whose lives are only barely valuable can have more total goodness than a small number of individuals whose lives are significantly good. Again, intuitively, it seems that this kind of world would not be better than our own. Another reason to reject total consequentialism is that it treats all utility gains of a given amount as equivalent, although it seems that utility gains for those who are significantly worse-off are better than identical utility gains for those who are significantly better-off. For these reasons, &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; consequentialism should be rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two components of utilitarianism’s aggregation function that I believe should be rejected are Equal Consideration and Agent-neutrality. Consider the following reasons to reject these components of utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agents have moral permission to assign special intrinsic priority to particular agents. To see why, imagine a scenario where an agent can save the lives of several innocent persons by amputating one of his arms. It seems to me that while undergoing such a sacrifice might be admirable, it is certainly not morally &lt;em&gt;obligatory&lt;/em&gt;. That is, an agent would not be morally &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. blameworthy) if they refused to undergo this sacrifice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agents are morally permitted to assign special priority to the goodness of their loved ones. For example, if a mother has to chose between saving her children versus a larger number of unrelated children (assume each of the unrelated children can be expected to produce just as much good as each of the mother’s children), it seems that the mother has &lt;em&gt;permission&lt;/em&gt; to chose her own children rather than sacrificing her children. In other words, the mother is not morally &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;blameworthy&lt;/em&gt; if she places special priority on her children. If my intuitions in these examples are reliable, then we should abandon the Equal Consideration and Agent-neutrality components of utilitarianism. Agents should have moral permission to ascribe to either themselves or their loved ones a special, finite weight to their goodness when evaluating the rightness of their actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agent-neutrality rules out agent-relative constraints. Without agent-relative constraints, an agent would be obligated to kill one innocent person to save the lives of a greater number of innocent persons. For example, consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#ConWhaRigRelRul&quot;&gt;Transplant thought experiment&lt;/a&gt; which is meant to be an objection to classic utilitarianism. Imagine that a doctor has five injured patients in a hospital who have each been stabbed in a different vital organ. Also, imagine that the doctor has the opportunity to kill a random healthy patient and distribute his organs to the sick patients to save the five. If we assume that each of the patients can be expected to produce the same amount of goodness in the future, then, on agent-neutral utilitarianism, the doctor would be morally &lt;em&gt;obligated&lt;/em&gt; to kill the healthy patient to save the five injured patients. This seems completely incorrect. The doctor is not morally obligated to kill the healthy patient in this case. In fact, it doesn’t even seem that he is morally &lt;em&gt;permitted&lt;/em&gt; to kill the healthy patient. However, the only way to account for this intuition is to introduce agent-relative considerations in the theory of value. If we use an agent-neutral theory of value, then we examine the goodness produced by actions from an impartial observer’s perspective. In that case, the world with less people dying is clearly superior to the world with more people dying. However, on an agent-relative theory of value, we examine the goodness produced by an action from the perspective of the agent who performs the action. With agent-relativity, we can say that, from the doctor’s perspective, it is worse to kill the healthy patient because it is worse that &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; kill an innocent patient than it is that someone else kills five innocents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relationship-between-collective-goodness-and-moral-rightness&quot;&gt;Relationship between collective goodness and moral rightness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s assume we have a perfect theory of individual goodness and a perfect aggregation function, which provides us with a perfect way to measure collective goodness. Let’s see how collective goodness relates to the rightness of actions. Following SEP, the following components of utilitarianism indicate how collective goodness relates to moral rightness: Actual Consequentialism, Direct Consequentialism and Maximizing Consequentialism. It seems to me that the adoption of actual and maximizing consequentialism has highly unintuitive implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firstly, it seems like foreseeable or intended consequences should be relevant instead of the actual consequences of an action. E.g. if someone attempts to murder an innocent person for an unacceptable reason (e.g. say, because they hated the race of the victim), this action is morally &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. the intended killer is morally &lt;em&gt;blameworthy&lt;/em&gt;) regardless of whether their attempt was successful. On the other hand, if a driver accidentally kills a pedestrian because the pedestrian recklessly ran before his car (imagine that the driver didn’t intend to injure anyone, nor could he reasonably foresee that the pedestrian would run into the world, nor was the driver negligent in any manner), then it doesn’t seem that the driver is morally wrong, i.e. he doesn’t seem blameworthy. So the actual consequences should be the basis for the moral assessment of an action. Rather, it should either be the intended or foreseeable consequences, as these consequences can inform us of the agent’s choices, which is crucially relevant in assessing his character.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secondly, it seems like maximizing consequentialism is far &lt;a href=&quot;https://philpapers.org/browse/demandingness-of-consequentialism&quot;&gt;too demanding&lt;/a&gt;. For the vast majority of agents, to maximize the goodness in the world would involve the agent undergoing huge sacrifices on themselves (so long as the agent does not ascribe to himself an unreasonably large priority). For example, imagine that an agent can kill themselves to save N other lives. Also, let N be greater than whatever additional weight the agent is free to ascribe to the goodness of his life. Let’s say that the agent weighs the goodness of his life at 10 times anyone else and N=20. Assume the goodness to be produced by each person involved in this scenario is the same. In this scenario, under maximizing consequentialism, the agent would be morally required to kill himself as that would maximize goodness, but presumably this is not right. Another problem with maximizing consequentialism is that it does not allow for &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supererogation/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;supererogatory&lt;/em&gt; actions&lt;/a&gt;. That is, it doesn’t allow for the existence of actions that are morally praiseworthy but which are not morally obligatory, but this seems wrong. It seems like it is possible for an agent to go above and beyond the requirements of morality, but this is not possible under maximizing consequentialism. For example, intuitively to spend all of one’s discretionary income on charity would be morally &lt;em&gt;praiseworthy&lt;/em&gt;, but not morally &lt;em&gt;obligatory&lt;/em&gt;. Maximizing utilitarianism would rule out this class of actions entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, I said that a consequentialist theory can be broken down into three components: (1) a theory of individual goodness (e.g. hedonism vs desire-theory), and (2) a theory of how the goodness of individuals relates to the collective goodness (e.g. summation vs average utilitarianism), and (3) a theory of how collective goodness relates to the rightness of actions (e.g. maximizing vs satisficing). I argued that utilitarianism has hugely unattractive implications for each of these components. In the future, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/why-im-not-a-consequentialist/&quot;&gt;I’ll make a post&lt;/a&gt; explaining why (1) consequentialist can avoid all of these issues that plague utilitarianism, and (2) despite this, why I’m not a consequentialist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Here are the primary features of classic utilitarianism from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on consequentialism (as of April 2021): Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on consequences (as opposed to the circumstances or the intrinsic nature of the act or anything that happens before the act). Evaluative Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the value of the consequences (as opposed to non-evaluative features of the consequences). Actual Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on the actual consequences (as opposed to foreseen, foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences). Direct Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of that act itself (as opposed to the consequences of the agent’s motive, of a rule or practice that covers other acts of the same kind, and so on). Maximizing Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on which consequences are best (as opposed to merely satisfactory or an improvement over the status quo). Aggregative Consequentialism = which consequences are best is some function of the values of parts of those consequences (as opposed to rankings of whole worlds or sets of consequences). Total Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the total net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average net good per person). Universal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends on the consequences for all people or sentient beings (as opposed to only the individual agent, members of the individual’s society, present people, or any other limited group). Equal Consideration = in determining moral rightness, benefits to one person matter just as much as similar benefits to any other person (as opposed to putting more weight on the worse or worst off). Agent-neutrality = whether some consequences are better than others does not depend on whether the consequences are evaluated from the perspective of the agent (as opposed to an observer). Hedonism = the value of the consequences depends only on the pleasures and pains in the consequences (as opposed to other supposed goods, such as freedom, knowledge, life, and so on). When I refer to “utilitarianism”, I will be referring to this narrow definition. Utilitarianism, like most consequentialist moral theories, can be broken down into two broad components: (1) a theory of goodness, and (2) a theory of how the goodness of the outcome of an act relates to that act’s rightness. Utilitarianism says that (1) goodness is constituted by the total summation of the pleasure over pain of all sentient creatures where each creature is given equal consideration, and (2) an act is right if and only if the actual consequences of that act have more goodness than any other alternative. Further, I believe that a theory of goodness can be broken down into two subcomponents: (1a) a theory of individual goodness, and (1b) a theory of how the goodness of individuals relates to the collective goodness (e.g. using some sort of aggregation function). Utilitarianism says that (1a) individual goodness is constituted by the total amount of pleasure and pain for that individual, and (1b) the collective goodness is simply the total summation of every sentient creature’s individual goodness. In this post, I will criticize each of these three components of utilitarianism. These criticisms, I believe, provide sufficient reason to reject utilitarianism. Individual goodness One of the most unattractive features of utilitarianism is its theory of individual goodness: hedonism. Hedonism states that the value or goodness of our lives depends only on the pleasure and pain that we experience. I reject hedonism because it advocates performing the action that produces the most pleasure even when this conflicts with one’s strongest goals and plans in life. For example, imagine that there exists a special drug such that consuming the drug for the rest of one’s life was the best way to maximize the expected amount of pleasure one would experience. However, anyone who takes the drug becomes severely addicted and is rendered unable to pursue any of their other goals or plans in life; the rest of their life is spent in either inebriation or acquiring resources necessary to gather additional drugs to restore their inebriated state. Now imagine someone is given the opportunity to chose whether to consume the drug (also assume that their decision has no significant impact on other people, to avoid complications due to moral considerations). It seems to me that this individual could have more reason to decline to consume the drug, assuming he had other goals that he considered more important than the pleasure that would be produced by this drug, e.g. goals related to his career, projects, hobbies, etc. (I say “could” rather than “would” because presumably there could be circumstances where an individual actually had more reason to consume the drug). However, this doesn’t quite make sense under hedonism. Hedonism states that the best life is the one with more pleasure over pain, and presumably we have most reason (absent moral considerations) to make our lives go best. Thus, if hedonism were true, it could not be the case that the individual could have more reason to refrain from taking the drug since, by hypothesis, taking this drug would produce the highest expected amount of pleasure and (therefore) good for that person. For this reason, I believe a proper theory of individual goodness should be some sort of refined desire theory, where goodness for an agent is constituted by the satisfaction of that agent’s fully informed and fully rational desires. More specifically, I believe I proper theory of individual goodness should be based on what an agent has reason to desire, where an agent’s reasons (as I’ve argued here) are the rational extension of an agent’s motivational set (motivational set includes elements such as desires, values, goals, plans, normative judgments, etc.). Aggregation Function Now, let’s assume we have a perfect theory of individual goodness. Let’s consider the aggregation function that utilitarianism endorses, i.e. let’s see what utilitarianism says about the relationship between (a) the goodness of each of the lives of the individual members of a group and (b) the overall goodness of the group as a whole. Following SEP, the aggregation function used by utilitarianism states that the relationship between individual goodness and collective goodness has the following components: Aggregative Consequentialism, Total Consequentialism, Universal Consequentialism, Equal Consideration, and Agent-neutrality. I reject utilitarianism’s aggregation function as I reject Total Consequentialism, Equal Consideration and Agent-neutrality. I will first consider Total Consequentialism. Total Consequentialism states moral rightness depends only on the total net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average net good per person). There are at least two objections to consequentialist theories that identify goodness with the summation of the individual goodness of each member in a group.

To say that a person &lt;em&gt;owns&lt;/em&gt; a certain entity implies that the person has certain &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; rights over the entity, including rights to control the use of the entity, rights to transfer these rights to others, immunities to the non-consensual loss of these rights, etc. (see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/&quot;&gt;entry&lt;/a&gt; on libertarianism for more details). In other words, ownership is simply a “bundle of particular rights” (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/OTSUKAM/leftlibP&amp;amp;PA.pdf&quot;&gt;Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204)&lt;/a&gt;). However, while it may be intuitive that persons have certain ownership rights (e.g. everyone owns their bodies), there is still an open question regarding how ownership rights should be delineated. In other words, there is still an open question as to which “bundle of rights” come with ownership. For example, you may own your car, but you do not have the moral right to drive your car onto oncoming traffic. So we need principles that govern how to delineate ownership rights. I will argue in this post that one such principle is what Eric Mack calls the “anti-paralysis” postulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will defend the “anti-paralysis” on grounds that almost all libertarians share. By “almost all” libertarians, I’m referring to libertarians who are neither far-left nor far-right. I will first consider some rights that almost all libertarians endorse. Then I will argue that the unifying rationale for these rights is a desire to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the will of others. This rationale suggests that we should delineate rights in accordance with the “anti-paralysis” postulate, i.e. in a way that does not cause “moral paralysis” - a condition whereby an individual is incapable of leading their own life without violating the rights of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;libertarian-rights&quot;&gt;Libertarian rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will first consider why libertarians place an inherent value on rights (as opposed to some other moral concept such as utility). Next, I consider some specifications of particular rights that almost all libertarians endorse. I will argue that the unifying rationale for endorsing these rights is to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being controlled by the will of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-rights&quot;&gt;Why rights?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the purpose of morality is to constrain our rational self-interested behavior. In other words, morality is meant to guide our behavior towards ends that we wouldn’t otherwise pursue if we were fully rational, self-interested creatures. Thus, to understand the motivation of any moral theory, it might help to imagine a world where people did not behave according to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; moral theory - a kind of “moral anarchy” as Nicolás Maloberti describes. This might help illuminate some of the motivations for adopting a rights-based moral system as opposed to, say, a consequentialist based moral system. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch11&quot;&gt;Nicolás Maloberti (2017, p. 156)&lt;/a&gt; describes moral anarchy as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In moral anarchy, individuals are free to treat others as mere resources for the satisfaction of their own personal goals. Moral anarchy could result in a state of affairs in which a great number of individuals are powerless to arrange their lives in the way they want. Having different goals and preferences regarding how best to achieve those goals, and having a natural tendency to care more strongly about the satisfaction of their own goals than the goals of others, individuals under moral anarchy might constantly interfere with one another in their corresponding pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, under moral anarchy, individuals are morally permitted to pursue their own self-interested goals and preferences. They are “free” in the sense that there is no moral duty to refrain from maximizing the satisfaction of their preferences. However, the sense in which they are “free” seems meaningless. Sure, you have the liberty to pursue your personal goals and preferences, but other individuals have the same liberty to pursue their personal goals and preferences, even if the fulfillment of their goals seriously frustrates your own. In other words, other individuals have the liberty to treat you as a means for whatever their goals might happen to be, regardless of the limitations imposed on your freedom. If everyone is given maximum &lt;em&gt;moral&lt;/em&gt; liberty to live their life the way they choose, then no one (other than the most powerful) has &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; liberty to live their life as they choose. Under moral anarchy, might effectively makes right, which means individuals would be consumed under the all-consuming conflict and demands of competitors and stronger agents with conflicting goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with moral anarchy is that we need moral &lt;em&gt;prohibitions&lt;/em&gt; so that individuals can make use of their moral &lt;em&gt;permissions&lt;/em&gt;. Nicolás Maloberti (p. 156) understands moral theories as ways of “specifying the conditions under which individuals must constrain their self-interested pursuit of goals.” In other words, moral theories provide solutions to moral anarchy by specifying (among other things) the moral prohibitions that should constraint individuals’ behaviors. This characterization makes sense to me. One such solution is provided by utilitarianism. I reject &lt;a href=&quot;https://categoricalrigor.wordpress.com/2019/11/30/why-im-not-a-utilitarian/&quot;&gt;utilitarianism&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://categoricalrigor.wordpress.com/2019/11/30/why-im-not-a-consequentialist/&quot;&gt;consequentialism&lt;/a&gt; generally) for a variety of reasons that I explore elsewhere. But for present purposes, it suffices to say that I reject utilitarianism as a solution to moral anarchy because it does not satisfactorily address the main detestable features of moral anarchy. Moral anarchy is detestable because it allows individuals to be used as resources by other people which results in people being unable to lead their own lives. But, as Maloberti (p. 157) points out, utilitarianism does not seem to adequately accommodate this worry because it unconditionally permits these same behaviors so long as the end result is more happiness over suffering. Whereas moral anarchy allows individuals to be used as resources by the strongest, utilitarianism allows individuals to be used as resources by anyone who would produce more net happiness by such usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at possible solutions to moral anarchy from a rights-based moral theory. If we think of moral &lt;em&gt;permissions&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights, then the problem with moral anarchy is that it focuses &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; on liberty-rights. What is a liberty-right to life if other people have a liberty-right to terminate your life? It’s clear that liberty-rights are not sufficient. There is another essential dimension of rights that moral anarchy ignores: &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights. Claim-rights impose moral &lt;em&gt;prohibitions&lt;/em&gt; on how individuals live their lives, specifically by restricting the ways an individual can interfere with another person’s life. Interestingly, the rationale for granting people claim-rights is the very same as the rationale we might have for granting people liberty-rights. The reason we might grant someone liberty-rights is to enable individuals to lead their own lives, but this very goal is frustrated by other people exercising their liberty-rights unless we also propose &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights which constrain those liberty-rights. In other words, in order to allow for the &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; use of liberty-rights, we need claim-rights to attenuate our liberty-rights. For these reasons, it is clear that claim-rights are just as important as liberty-rights. As Maloberti (p. 157) notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In contrast to classical versions of utilitarianism, rights theories do not propose to escape from moral anarchy by means of providing a unique goal that all must serve either directly or indirectly. Instead, they propose to protect individuals’ pursuits of their own personal goals regardless of their optimality in the maximization of aggregative value. In order to accomplish this, rights theories allocate control to each individual over a specific set or range of actions. These allocations of control allow the individual to perform or refrain from performing the corresponding actions, and they impose on others the obligations not to interfere. Those ranges of actions might then be understood as configuring areas of freedom. Within those areas, the individual is taken to be fully sovereign in terms of what may be done…Within libertarian theory, individuals’ most basic areas of moral freedom are generally specified in terms of ownership rights, that is, in terms of the material objects that those individuals are entitled to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise boundaries of ownership rights are not to be discussed here. The point is merely to mention the attractive features of a rights-based theory such as libertarianism. The attraction of rights-based theories lies in their ability to protect us from being used as resources for others. It grants us a sovereign space by carving out boundaries within which we can lead our own lives (so long as we don’t encroach on anyone else’s boundaries) without being subject to the will of anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;property-rights&quot;&gt;Property rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All libertarians are committed to each individual having strong ownership of their body (i.e self-ownership). That is, individuals have a claim-right against other people who might control their body without consent, and they have a liberty-right to use their body as they see fit (so long as it doesn’t encroach on like-rights for others). But almost all libertarians (including anarchists) believe that we also have the right to acquire ownership over objects beyond our individual bodies. The rationale for property ownership is the same as the rationale for self-ownership: if we only had self-ownership and no property ownership, our self-ownership would be merely formal; all individuals need the ability to control extrapersonal objects in order to live, to pursue their projects, and to lead their own lives. These are the same motivations to support self-ownership rights to begin with. So, if we have reasons to grant individuals self-ownership rights, we also have reasons to grant them property ownership rights. Now, there are infinitely many different ways libertarians might specify property rights. Philosophers have been labeled as either right-leaning or left-leaning libertarian depending on the extent to which their conceptions of property rights entail egalitarian ownership of resources (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/#LeftRight&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some examples). Interestingly, most libertarians have rejected both extreme left-leaning and extreme right-leaning conceptions of property rights for surprisingly similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of an extreme left-leaning conception of property rights is a universal joint-ownership conception of property. On this theory, every individual owns an equal portion of every external resource. Maloberti (p. 157) describes it as a system whereby “each individual would be assigned a claim right against every other, against the use and possessions of those resources. No individual would thus have the liberty to use or possess such resources without the approval of everybody else”. Because we have given every individual extreme &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights, the result is that everyone’s &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights are effectively minimized. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;pid=sites&amp;amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwcm9mZXNzb3JlcmljbWFja3xneDo5NDMzMGE1ODkxOTJiOWY&quot;&gt;Eric Mack (2015, p. 213)&lt;/a&gt; signs on to this complaint when he says, “if the earth were the joint property of all mankind…there would be no elbow room for individuals to exercise their most fundamental natural right, viz., ‘the right everyone had to take care of, and provide for their Subsistence’ (Locke 1689, First Treatise, §87). For (almost) any exercise of this fundamental right requires that individuals be at liberty to acquire private property or, at the very least, to make use of portions of the earth.” So the problem with extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights is the same problem that we experienced with moral anarchy: individuals would have effectively no liberty to acquire the resources which are necessary to lead their own lives. We would be at the mercy of the will of everyone else in order to lead our lives. Interestingly, the source of the problem is the &lt;em&gt;reverse&lt;/em&gt; of moral anarchy: in moral anarchy, the problem was we maximized liberty-rights at the expense of claim-rights; under robust joint ownership, we maximized claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, most libertarians “accept that individuals can acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without having to ask the consent of approval of other people, some governing body, or anything else” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/#PowerApp&quot;&gt;section 3&lt;/a&gt; of the SEP on Libertarianism), which means they reject extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights. However, most libertarians accept that permissible property acquisition, while unilateral, must be subject to the &lt;em&gt;Lockean Proviso&lt;/em&gt; that the acquisition leaves “enough, and as good” for others. As Eric Mack (p. 214) notes, the Lockean Proviso “requires that the acquisition and disposition of property rights not on net make the extra-personal world less susceptible to any individual’s efforts to exercise his powers in ways that serve his ends.” Only the most extreme &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;-leaning conceptions of property rights reject &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; forms of the Lockean Proviso. Note that the complaint against extreme &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;-leaning conceptions of property rights is the same as the complaint against extreme &lt;em&gt;left&lt;/em&gt;-leaning conceptions: without the Lockean Proviso, a privileged group of individuals could in principle come to own all valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being unable to lead their lives; everyone else would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire basic external resources necessary to lead their own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even though the complaint against both extreme left-leaning and extreme right-leaning conceptions of property are the same, the &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of the complaints is the reverse. On the one hand, extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights are rejected because they overly privilege &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights. On the other hand, extreme right-leaning conceptions are rejected because they overly privilege &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights. Granting people excessive claim-rights (to all external resources) under joint ownership &lt;em&gt;causes the same problem&lt;/em&gt; as granting people excessive liberty-rights (to acquire unowned resources) without a Lockean Proviso: individuals are left unfree to lead their own lives; they are instead at the mercy of the will of others (whether its at the mercy of other landowners or the general population). This reveals an important lesson: when delineating the specifications of individual rights, we have to perform a trade-off between the claim-rights and liberty-rights that are specified. We cannot increase one without reducing the other. Further, this trade-off must not overly privilege either dimension at the exclusion of the other. Otherwise, the result is that there is no effective liberty for people to lead their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enforcement-rights&quot;&gt;Enforcement rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above has focused on basic ownership rights, both of one’s body and of property. But there is another right that almost all libertarians (including anarchists) agree that we have: &lt;em&gt;enforcement&lt;/em&gt; rights. Enforcement rights involve rights to retaliatory threats and self-defense to prevent future rights violations, and potentially the right to seek restitution and perhaps punishment for past rights violations. Every non-pacifist libertarian accepts some form of enforcement right, and (I would argue) for good reason. Given the observations made earlier in this post, I believe we can give an adequate explanation for why some libertarians are pacifists, an explanation that (I believe) reveals where they go wrong. One explanation for why some libertarians might support pacifism is that they assign special privilege to the claim-rights that individuals have; our claim-rights to our body/property are so strong that we maintain those claim-rights even when we are violating or have violated someone else’s rights, which makes it morally impermissible for others to retaliate in self-defense. Hopefully, the error here is clear. The error with this pacifist argument is that it &lt;em&gt;overly&lt;/em&gt; privileges our claim-rights at the exclusion of our liberty-rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Maloberti (p. 158) argues, “Anything short of that [permitting enforcement rights] will fail to provide the holders of basic rights with a sphere of moral freedom that is not contingent on others’ willingness to respect it.” Eric Mack (p. 214) echoes this sentiment in his argument for enforcement rights: “One natural line of argument goes from the prospective victim’s self-ownership to her possession of a moral liberty to defend herself against violations of that right, and from that moral liberty to harm-inflicting defensive acts not being [rights violations].” In other words, the reason that we ought to ascribe to individuals enforcement rights is that, without such rights, their basic ownership rights are effectively meaningless. If our ownership rights are to provide us with any &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; liberty, then we must have not only the &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-right against individuals who might violate our rights, but also &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights to retaliate against individuals who might do so. Thus, the motivation for supporting enforcement rights is the same motivation for supporting basic ownership rights in the first place. If one’s ownership rights are to mean anything, they must be complemented with enforcement rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;minor-intrusions&quot;&gt;Minor intrusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, consider &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; intrusions on someone’s body or legitimately acquired resources. Typically, libertarians treat minor intrusions with equal (or at least comparable) seriousness as major intrusions. E.g. just as it is impermissible for me to steal your kidney, it is also impermissible for me to steal your dollar. In both cases, I’m taking something that you &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt;, which means in both cases, I’m violating your &lt;em&gt;rights&lt;/em&gt;. If that is correct, then this would seem to erase our moral permissions to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. After all, whenever I burn leaves in my backyard, I cause smoke particles to fall in your yard. Whenever I use a telephone or a radio, I cause electromagnetic waves to be sent through your body and your property. Whenever I produce sound, I send sound waves through your home which impacts your eardrums. Whenever I breathe, I emit carbon dioxide which pollutes your airspace, and hence your property and your lungs. This leaves no room for what we are morally permitted to do, i.e. “moral paralysis”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/667863&quot;&gt;David Sobel (2012)&lt;/a&gt; argues this point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of difficult to avoid, minor infringements on other people’s bodies makes the simple argument [from libertarian rights to standard libertarian conclusions] unattractive. Strong moral constraints against all such infringements would make too many things impermissible. The thought that, quite generally, my self-ownership creates very powerful moral constraints on any and all involuntary infringements on my body would unacceptably interfere with your liberty as Nozick saw…Could the philosophical theory named for liberty actually turn out to be unacceptably restrictive of our liberty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/91ba/b231fe7e9f517779cf443b7578aaf78c262b.pdf&quot;&gt;Peter Railton (1985)&lt;/a&gt; has made similar arguments related to pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will argue that when one attempts to apply such [Lockean rights] theories to moral questions about pollution, they present a different face, one set so firmly against laissez faire – or laissez polluter – as to countenance serious restriction of what Lockeans have traditionally taken to be the proper sphere of individual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, from earlier lessons, we can see the error with these claims. The arguments by Sobel and Railton are mistaken in that they ignore that there are two separate dimensions of rights - &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights and _liberty-_rights. As stated earlier, a reasonable delineation of rights must not overly privilege one dimension at the exclusion of the other. The arguments by Ratilon and Sobel rest on a conception of rights that maximizes claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights. This is the same criticism as pacifism and joint-ownership of property. As stated earlier, a proper delineation of rights involves giving significant weight to both claim-rights and liberty-rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delineating-ownership-rights&quot;&gt;Delineating ownership rights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-multiple-dimensions-of-rights&quot;&gt;The multiple dimensions of rights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations provide some insight into the nature of ownership. It might be assumed that self-ownership is a single concept with a precise, determinate content. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/OTSUKAM/leftlibP&amp;amp;PA.pdf&quot;&gt;Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204)&lt;/a&gt; define “full self-ownership” as “a bundle of rights that is (roughly) equal to the logically strongest set of ownership rights that people can have over themselves compatible with others having equal such rights over themselves”. However, there is no &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; “logically strongest” set of rights. Indeed, the authors later note that “full self-ownership involves some undeniable indeterminacy” because “there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights” (p. 205). For example, if you have two bundles of rights X and Y, then X might be stronger than Y along one dimension (e.g. in terms of liberty-rights), but Y might be stronger than X along another dimension (e.g. in terms of claim-rights).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781317486794.ch14&quot;&gt;Jason Brennan and Bas van der Vossen (2017, p. 209)&lt;/a&gt; articulated the multifaceted nature of self-ownership:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protections (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing on the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not know what is the best mix of liberty-rights and claim-rights. In fact, I am not even sure if there could be a satisfactory answer. However, as the examples thus far have shown, I am in confident that the proper mix does not involve the &lt;em&gt;exclusion&lt;/em&gt; of either variable. Maximizing liberty-rights at the exclusion of claim-rights leads to “moral anarchy”. Maximizing claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights leads to “morally paralysis”, as everyone would be prohibited from imposing even minor intrusions on others. Both are unacceptable as they leave us at the mercy of the will of others, without any &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; freedom, and without the ability to lead our own lives. This insight leads to the anti-paralysis postulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anti-paralysis-postulate&quot;&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate by Eric Mack (he now refers to it as the “Elbow Room postulate” but I prefer the older naming) is a principle that specifies that rights must be delineated without causing “moral paralysis”. Mack (p. 197) details the postulate as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to this postulate, a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect. When Railton and Sobel point out that the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, they are pointing out that this impermissibility would systematically morally preclude individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that are ascribed to them—the exercise of which is supposed to be protected by the claim-rights ascribed to them. The elbow room postulate tells us that, since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, a reasonable delineation of rights does not construe minor intrusions as boundary-crossings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have interpreted Mack’s postulate as treating claim-rights as a form of force that a moral theory must protect individuals from, just as moral theories must protect individuals from coercion from other individuals. &lt;a href=&quot;https://philarchive.org/rec/SOBQPO&quot;&gt;David Sobel (2018)&lt;/a&gt; gave the following interpretation of the postulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mack seems to be saying that the point of rights is to provide protection not only from other people forcibly preventing me from living my life by my lights, but also from a system of rights that would morally prohibit me from doing so…Mack can therefore be interpreted as saying that the point of rights is to enhance our ability to live our own lives by our own lights, unprevented by others or by the moral force of other people’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, just as we should not grant individuals excessive &lt;em&gt;liberty&lt;/em&gt;-rights since that would make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral anarchy”), we also should not grant individuals excessive &lt;em&gt;claim&lt;/em&gt;-rights since that would also make the rights of others meaningless (“moral paralysis”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the rationale for the anti-paralysis postulate is not ad-hoc or anti-libertarian. The justification of the anti-paralysis postulate is based on the exact same rationale for ascribing to individuals libertarian ownership rights in the first place. We ascribe to individuals liberty-rights so that they can have a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being at the mercy of the will of others. We further ascribe to individuals claim-rights which &lt;em&gt;formally&lt;/em&gt; reduces their liberty-rights, but which &lt;em&gt;effectively&lt;/em&gt; enhances those liberty-rights by protecting their liberty-rights from being frustrated other individuals exercising their excessive liberty-rights. The same motivations justify unilateral property acquisition, the Lockean Proviso, enforcement rights, and minor intrusions. In all cases, the motivation is to avoid mixes of liberty-rights and claim-rights that effectively nullify our liberty-rights. Since the very reason we ascribed claim-rights to individuals in the first place is to enhance our effective liberty-rights, it makes sense that the claim-rights do not systematically preclude the exercise of those liberty-rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-paralysis postulate has many important implications. As stated earlier, it can explain many of the rights that almost all libertarians accept, e.g. enforcement rights, rights to impose minor intrusions, the Lockean Proviso, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;http://reasonwithoutrestraint.com/justifying-the-state-on-libertarian-grounds/#How_to_delineate_ownership_rights&quot;&gt;I also argued in another post&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-paralysis postulate can also justify mandatory taxation by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name>JayMoss</name></author><summary type="html">Libertarians are in near-unanimous agreement in their endorsement of ownership rights, both over one’s person and over private property. To say that a person owns a certain entity implies that the person has certain moral rights over the entity, including rights to control the use of the entity, rights to transfer these rights to others, immunities to the non-consensual loss of these rights, etc. (see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on libertarianism for more details). In other words, ownership is simply a “bundle of particular rights” (see Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204)). However, while it may be intuitive that persons have certain ownership rights (e.g. everyone owns their bodies), there is still an open question regarding how ownership rights should be delineated. In other words, there is still an open question as to which “bundle of rights” come with ownership. For example, you may own your car, but you do not have the moral right to drive your car onto oncoming traffic. So we need principles that govern how to delineate ownership rights. I will argue in this post that one such principle is what Eric Mack calls the “anti-paralysis” postulate. I will defend the “anti-paralysis” on grounds that almost all libertarians share. By “almost all” libertarians, I’m referring to libertarians who are neither far-left nor far-right. I will first consider some rights that almost all libertarians endorse. Then I will argue that the unifying rationale for these rights is a desire to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being subject to the will of others. This rationale suggests that we should delineate rights in accordance with the “anti-paralysis” postulate, i.e. in a way that does not cause “moral paralysis” - a condition whereby an individual is incapable of leading their own life without violating the rights of others. Libertarian rights In this section, I will first consider why libertarians place an inherent value on rights (as opposed to some other moral concept such as utility). Next, I consider some specifications of particular rights that almost all libertarians endorse. I will argue that the unifying rationale for endorsing these rights is to grant each individual a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being controlled by the will of others. Why rights? I believe the purpose of morality is to constrain our rational self-interested behavior. In other words, morality is meant to guide our behavior towards ends that we wouldn’t otherwise pursue if we were fully rational, self-interested creatures. Thus, to understand the motivation of any moral theory, it might help to imagine a world where people did not behave according to any moral theory - a kind of “moral anarchy” as Nicolás Maloberti describes. This might help illuminate some of the motivations for adopting a rights-based moral system as opposed to, say, a consequentialist based moral system. Nicolás Maloberti (2017, p. 156) describes moral anarchy as follows: In moral anarchy, individuals are free to treat others as mere resources for the satisfaction of their own personal goals. Moral anarchy could result in a state of affairs in which a great number of individuals are powerless to arrange their lives in the way they want. Having different goals and preferences regarding how best to achieve those goals, and having a natural tendency to care more strongly about the satisfaction of their own goals than the goals of others, individuals under moral anarchy might constantly interfere with one another in their corresponding pursuits. In other words, under moral anarchy, individuals are morally permitted to pursue their own self-interested goals and preferences. They are “free” in the sense that there is no moral duty to refrain from maximizing the satisfaction of their preferences. However, the sense in which they are “free” seems meaningless. Sure, you have the liberty to pursue your personal goals and preferences, but other individuals have the same liberty to pursue their personal goals and preferences, even if the fulfillment of their goals seriously frustrates your own. In other words, other individuals have the liberty to treat you as a means for whatever their goals might happen to be, regardless of the limitations imposed on your freedom. If everyone is given maximum moral liberty to live their life the way they choose, then no one (other than the most powerful) has effective liberty to live their life as they choose. Under moral anarchy, might effectively makes right, which means individuals would be consumed under the all-consuming conflict and demands of competitors and stronger agents with conflicting goals. The issue with moral anarchy is that we need moral prohibitions so that individuals can make use of their moral permissions. Nicolás Maloberti (p. 156) understands moral theories as ways of “specifying the conditions under which individuals must constrain their self-interested pursuit of goals.” In other words, moral theories provide solutions to moral anarchy by specifying (among other things) the moral prohibitions that should constraint individuals’ behaviors. This characterization makes sense to me. One such solution is provided by utilitarianism. I reject utilitarianism (and consequentialism generally) for a variety of reasons that I explore elsewhere. But for present purposes, it suffices to say that I reject utilitarianism as a solution to moral anarchy because it does not satisfactorily address the main detestable features of moral anarchy. Moral anarchy is detestable because it allows individuals to be used as resources by other people which results in people being unable to lead their own lives. But, as Maloberti (p. 157) points out, utilitarianism does not seem to adequately accommodate this worry because it unconditionally permits these same behaviors so long as the end result is more happiness over suffering. Whereas moral anarchy allows individuals to be used as resources by the strongest, utilitarianism allows individuals to be used as resources by anyone who would produce more net happiness by such usage. Now, let’s look at possible solutions to moral anarchy from a rights-based moral theory. If we think of moral permissions as liberty-rights, then the problem with moral anarchy is that it focuses solely on liberty-rights. What is a liberty-right to life if other people have a liberty-right to terminate your life? It’s clear that liberty-rights are not sufficient. There is another essential dimension of rights that moral anarchy ignores: claim-rights. Claim-rights impose moral prohibitions on how individuals live their lives, specifically by restricting the ways an individual can interfere with another person’s life. Interestingly, the rationale for granting people claim-rights is the very same as the rationale we might have for granting people liberty-rights. The reason we might grant someone liberty-rights is to enable individuals to lead their own lives, but this very goal is frustrated by other people exercising their liberty-rights unless we also propose claim-rights which constrain those liberty-rights. In other words, in order to allow for the effective use of liberty-rights, we need claim-rights to attenuate our liberty-rights. For these reasons, it is clear that claim-rights are just as important as liberty-rights. As Maloberti (p. 157) notes: In contrast to classical versions of utilitarianism, rights theories do not propose to escape from moral anarchy by means of providing a unique goal that all must serve either directly or indirectly. Instead, they propose to protect individuals’ pursuits of their own personal goals regardless of their optimality in the maximization of aggregative value. In order to accomplish this, rights theories allocate control to each individual over a specific set or range of actions. These allocations of control allow the individual to perform or refrain from performing the corresponding actions, and they impose on others the obligations not to interfere. Those ranges of actions might then be understood as configuring areas of freedom. Within those areas, the individual is taken to be fully sovereign in terms of what may be done…Within libertarian theory, individuals’ most basic areas of moral freedom are generally specified in terms of ownership rights, that is, in terms of the material objects that those individuals are entitled to control. The precise boundaries of ownership rights are not to be discussed here. The point is merely to mention the attractive features of a rights-based theory such as libertarianism. The attraction of rights-based theories lies in their ability to protect us from being used as resources for others. It grants us a sovereign space by carving out boundaries within which we can lead our own lives (so long as we don’t encroach on anyone else’s boundaries) without being subject to the will of anyone else. Property rights All libertarians are committed to each individual having strong ownership of their body (i.e self-ownership). That is, individuals have a claim-right against other people who might control their body without consent, and they have a liberty-right to use their body as they see fit (so long as it doesn’t encroach on like-rights for others). But almost all libertarians (including anarchists) believe that we also have the right to acquire ownership over objects beyond our individual bodies. The rationale for property ownership is the same as the rationale for self-ownership: if we only had self-ownership and no property ownership, our self-ownership would be merely formal; all individuals need the ability to control extrapersonal objects in order to live, to pursue their projects, and to lead their own lives. These are the same motivations to support self-ownership rights to begin with. So, if we have reasons to grant individuals self-ownership rights, we also have reasons to grant them property ownership rights. Now, there are infinitely many different ways libertarians might specify property rights. Philosophers have been labeled as either right-leaning or left-leaning libertarian depending on the extent to which their conceptions of property rights entail egalitarian ownership of resources (see here for some examples). Interestingly, most libertarians have rejected both extreme left-leaning and extreme right-leaning conceptions of property rights for surprisingly similar reasons. An example of an extreme left-leaning conception of property rights is a universal joint-ownership conception of property. On this theory, every individual owns an equal portion of every external resource. Maloberti (p. 157) describes it as a system whereby “each individual would be assigned a claim right against every other, against the use and possessions of those resources. No individual would thus have the liberty to use or possess such resources without the approval of everybody else”. Because we have given every individual extreme claim-rights, the result is that everyone’s liberty-rights are effectively minimized. Eric Mack (2015, p. 213) signs on to this complaint when he says, “if the earth were the joint property of all mankind…there would be no elbow room for individuals to exercise their most fundamental natural right, viz., ‘the right everyone had to take care of, and provide for their Subsistence’ (Locke 1689, First Treatise, §87). For (almost) any exercise of this fundamental right requires that individuals be at liberty to acquire private property or, at the very least, to make use of portions of the earth.” So the problem with extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights is the same problem that we experienced with moral anarchy: individuals would have effectively no liberty to acquire the resources which are necessary to lead their own lives. We would be at the mercy of the will of everyone else in order to lead our lives. Interestingly, the source of the problem is the reverse of moral anarchy: in moral anarchy, the problem was we maximized liberty-rights at the expense of claim-rights; under robust joint ownership, we maximized claim-rights at the expense of liberty-rights. For this reason, most libertarians “accept that individuals can acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without having to ask the consent of approval of other people, some governing body, or anything else” (section 3 of the SEP on Libertarianism), which means they reject extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights. However, most libertarians accept that permissible property acquisition, while unilateral, must be subject to the Lockean Proviso that the acquisition leaves “enough, and as good” for others. As Eric Mack (p. 214) notes, the Lockean Proviso “requires that the acquisition and disposition of property rights not on net make the extra-personal world less susceptible to any individual’s efforts to exercise his powers in ways that serve his ends.” Only the most extreme right-leaning conceptions of property rights reject all forms of the Lockean Proviso. Note that the complaint against extreme right-leaning conceptions of property rights is the same as the complaint against extreme left-leaning conceptions: without the Lockean Proviso, a privileged group of individuals could in principle come to own all valuable resources, which would result in everyone else being unable to lead their lives; everyone else would be at the mercy of the privileged property owners to acquire basic external resources necessary to lead their own life. Interestingly, even though the complaint against both extreme left-leaning and extreme right-leaning conceptions of property are the same, the source of the complaints is the reverse. On the one hand, extreme left-leaning conceptions of property rights are rejected because they overly privilege claim-rights. On the other hand, extreme right-leaning conceptions are rejected because they overly privilege liberty-rights. Granting people excessive claim-rights (to all external resources) under joint ownership causes the same problem as granting people excessive liberty-rights (to acquire unowned resources) without a Lockean Proviso: individuals are left unfree to lead their own lives; they are instead at the mercy of the will of others (whether its at the mercy of other landowners or the general population). This reveals an important lesson: when delineating the specifications of individual rights, we have to perform a trade-off between the claim-rights and liberty-rights that are specified. We cannot increase one without reducing the other. Further, this trade-off must not overly privilege either dimension at the exclusion of the other. Otherwise, the result is that there is no effective liberty for people to lead their own lives. Enforcement rights The above has focused on basic ownership rights, both of one’s body and of property. But there is another right that almost all libertarians (including anarchists) agree that we have: enforcement rights. Enforcement rights involve rights to retaliatory threats and self-defense to prevent future rights violations, and potentially the right to seek restitution and perhaps punishment for past rights violations. Every non-pacifist libertarian accepts some form of enforcement right, and (I would argue) for good reason. Given the observations made earlier in this post, I believe we can give an adequate explanation for why some libertarians are pacifists, an explanation that (I believe) reveals where they go wrong. One explanation for why some libertarians might support pacifism is that they assign special privilege to the claim-rights that individuals have; our claim-rights to our body/property are so strong that we maintain those claim-rights even when we are violating or have violated someone else’s rights, which makes it morally impermissible for others to retaliate in self-defense. Hopefully, the error here is clear. The error with this pacifist argument is that it overly privileges our claim-rights at the exclusion of our liberty-rights. As Maloberti (p. 158) argues, “Anything short of that [permitting enforcement rights] will fail to provide the holders of basic rights with a sphere of moral freedom that is not contingent on others’ willingness to respect it.” Eric Mack (p. 214) echoes this sentiment in his argument for enforcement rights: “One natural line of argument goes from the prospective victim’s self-ownership to her possession of a moral liberty to defend herself against violations of that right, and from that moral liberty to harm-inflicting defensive acts not being [rights violations].” In other words, the reason that we ought to ascribe to individuals enforcement rights is that, without such rights, their basic ownership rights are effectively meaningless. If our ownership rights are to provide us with any effective liberty, then we must have not only the claim-right against individuals who might violate our rights, but also liberty-rights to retaliate against individuals who might do so. Thus, the motivation for supporting enforcement rights is the same motivation for supporting basic ownership rights in the first place. If one’s ownership rights are to mean anything, they must be complemented with enforcement rights. Minor intrusions Finally, consider minor intrusions on someone’s body or legitimately acquired resources. Typically, libertarians treat minor intrusions with equal (or at least comparable) seriousness as major intrusions. E.g. just as it is impermissible for me to steal your kidney, it is also impermissible for me to steal your dollar. In both cases, I’m taking something that you own, which means in both cases, I’m violating your rights. If that is correct, then this would seem to erase our moral permissions to do anything. After all, whenever I burn leaves in my backyard, I cause smoke particles to fall in your yard. Whenever I use a telephone or a radio, I cause electromagnetic waves to be sent through your body and your property. Whenever I produce sound, I send sound waves through your home which impacts your eardrums. Whenever I breathe, I emit carbon dioxide which pollutes your airspace, and hence your property and your lungs. This leaves no room for what we are morally permitted to do, i.e. “moral paralysis”. David Sobel (2012) argues this point: The ubiquity of difficult to avoid, minor infringements on other people’s bodies makes the simple argument [from libertarian rights to standard libertarian conclusions] unattractive. Strong moral constraints against all such infringements would make too many things impermissible. The thought that, quite generally, my self-ownership creates very powerful moral constraints on any and all involuntary infringements on my body would unacceptably interfere with your liberty as Nozick saw…Could the philosophical theory named for liberty actually turn out to be unacceptably restrictive of our liberty? Peter Railton (1985) has made similar arguments related to pollution. I will argue that when one attempts to apply such [Lockean rights] theories to moral questions about pollution, they present a different face, one set so firmly against laissez faire – or laissez polluter – as to countenance serious restriction of what Lockeans have traditionally taken to be the proper sphere of individual freedom. Fortunately, from earlier lessons, we can see the error with these claims. The arguments by Sobel and Railton are mistaken in that they ignore that there are two separate dimensions of rights - claim-rights and _liberty-_rights. As stated earlier, a reasonable delineation of rights must not overly privilege one dimension at the exclusion of the other. The arguments by Ratilon and Sobel rest on a conception of rights that maximizes claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights. This is the same criticism as pacifism and joint-ownership of property. As stated earlier, a proper delineation of rights involves giving significant weight to both claim-rights and liberty-rights. Delineating ownership rights The multiple dimensions of rights These considerations provide some insight into the nature of ownership. It might be assumed that self-ownership is a single concept with a precise, determinate content. For example, Vallentyne, Steiner, and Otsuka (2005, p. 204) define “full self-ownership” as “a bundle of rights that is (roughly) equal to the logically strongest set of ownership rights that people can have over themselves compatible with others having equal such rights over themselves”. However, there is no single “logically strongest” set of rights. Indeed, the authors later note that “full self-ownership involves some undeniable indeterminacy” because “there is no unique maximally strong set of ownership rights” (p. 205). For example, if you have two bundles of rights X and Y, then X might be stronger than Y along one dimension (e.g. in terms of liberty-rights), but Y might be stronger than X along another dimension (e.g. in terms of claim-rights). Jason Brennan and Bas van der Vossen (2017, p. 209) articulated the multifaceted nature of self-ownership: More precisely, we can think of self-ownership as being made up of two variables. On the one hand, self-ownership offers protections (in the form of Hohfeldian claim-rights) against unwanted incursions on one’s person. On the other hand, self-ownership offers the freedom (in the form of Hohfeldian liberties) to use one’s person. Since liberties logically entail the absence of duties (including duties correlating to claim-rights), it follows that the two variables (internal to the idea of self-ownership) can be traded off against each other. The real question, then, is what mix of the two variables internal to the idea of self-ownership (the claim to exclude and the freedom to use) is morally most desirable. This should be obvious, of course. Bas is a self-owner with the freedom to use his person, but this does not license him to punch Jason in the face. Self-ownership is not best understood by completely maximizing on the freedom variable to the complete denial of the exclusion variable. And, again pace Sobel, self-ownership is also not best understood by maximizing on the exclusion variable to the complete denial of the freedom variable. I do not know what is the best mix of liberty-rights and claim-rights. In fact, I am not even sure if there could be a satisfactory answer. However, as the examples thus far have shown, I am in confident that the proper mix does not involve the exclusion of either variable. Maximizing liberty-rights at the exclusion of claim-rights leads to “moral anarchy”. Maximizing claim-rights at the exclusion of liberty-rights leads to “morally paralysis”, as everyone would be prohibited from imposing even minor intrusions on others. Both are unacceptable as they leave us at the mercy of the will of others, without any effective freedom, and without the ability to lead our own lives. This insight leads to the anti-paralysis postulate. The anti-paralysis postulate The anti-paralysis postulate by Eric Mack (he now refers to it as the “Elbow Room postulate” but I prefer the older naming) is a principle that specifies that rights must be delineated without causing “moral paralysis”. Mack (p. 197) details the postulate as follows: According to this postulate, a reasonable delineation of basic moral rights must be such that the claim-rights that are ascribed to individuals do not systematically preclude people from exercising the liberty-rights that the claim-rights are supposed to protect. When Railton and Sobel point out that the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, they are pointing out that this impermissibility would systematically morally preclude individuals from exercising the liberty-rights that are ascribed to them—the exercise of which is supposed to be protected by the claim-rights ascribed to them. The elbow room postulate tells us that, since the impermissibility of minor intrusions would be hog-tying, a reasonable delineation of rights does not construe minor intrusions as boundary-crossings. Some have interpreted Mack’s postulate as treating claim-rights as a form of force that a moral theory must protect individuals from, just as moral theories must protect individuals from coercion from other individuals. David Sobel (2018) gave the following interpretation of the postulate: Mack seems to be saying that the point of rights is to provide protection not only from other people forcibly preventing me from living my life by my lights, but also from a system of rights that would morally prohibit me from doing so…Mack can therefore be interpreted as saying that the point of rights is to enhance our ability to live our own lives by our own lights, unprevented by others or by the moral force of other people’s rights. In other words, just as we should not grant individuals excessive liberty-rights since that would make the rights of others meaningless (i.e. “moral anarchy”), we also should not grant individuals excessive claim-rights since that would also make the rights of others meaningless (“moral paralysis”). Note that the rationale for the anti-paralysis postulate is not ad-hoc or anti-libertarian. The justification of the anti-paralysis postulate is based on the exact same rationale for ascribing to individuals libertarian ownership rights in the first place. We ascribe to individuals liberty-rights so that they can have a sovereign space within which they can lead their own lives without being at the mercy of the will of others. We further ascribe to individuals claim-rights which formally reduces their liberty-rights, but which effectively enhances those liberty-rights by protecting their liberty-rights from being frustrated other individuals exercising their excessive liberty-rights. The same motivations justify unilateral property acquisition, the Lockean Proviso, enforcement rights, and minor intrusions. In all cases, the motivation is to avoid mixes of liberty-rights and claim-rights that effectively nullify our liberty-rights. Since the very reason we ascribed claim-rights to individuals in the first place is to enhance our effective liberty-rights, it makes sense that the claim-rights do not systematically preclude the exercise of those liberty-rights. The anti-paralysis postulate has many important implications. As stated earlier, it can explain many of the rights that almost all libertarians accept, e.g. enforcement rights, rights to impose minor intrusions, the Lockean Proviso, etc. I also argued in another post that the anti-paralysis postulate can also justify mandatory taxation by the state. Relevant papers The primary papers that have influenced my position: Peter Railton, “Locke, Stock, and Peril: Natural Property Rights, Pollution, and Risk” (1985) - Argues that, contrary to popular belief, libertarianism places stringent limits on what we are able to with our property. The argument is based on the minor damages and risk associated with minor pollution forbids us from actions that we ordinarily think we have the right to do. [archive] David Sobel, “Backing Away from Libertarian Self-Ownership” (2012) - The first of a pair of papers that objects to the libertarian idea of self-ownership. This paper focuses on the implausible alleged implication of self-ownership that unnoticeably minor intrusions constitute rights violations. David Sobel, “Self-Ownership and the Conflation Problem” (2012) - The second paper from Sobel criticizing self-ownership. In this paper, he argues that libertarianism based on self-ownership is incapable of distinguishing the moral wrongness of minor intrusions and major intrusions when intuitively such a difference makes a huge difference morally. Eric Mack, “Elbow Room for Rights” (2015) in Oxford Studies in Political Philosophy, Volume 1 - Defends libertarianism from the objections put forth by Sobel and Railton. In it, Mack argues for what he calls the “elbow room postulate” (which I referred to as the “anti-paralysis postulate in this post) in order to permit the minor intrusions mentioned by Sobel and Railton. He also argues that other attempted solutions to the problem of minor intrusions fail to address the problem as well as the “elbow room postulate”. [archive] [selected papers by Eric Mack] Brennan and Van der Vossen, “The myths of the self-ownership Thesis” (2017) - Argues against many of the assumptions people have about self-ownership and libertarianism in general. They spend some time responding to Sobel’s objection based on minor intrusions. They also make the interesting claim that all liberals (not just libertarians) hold some form of the self-ownership thesis - the only live debate is over which conception of self-ownership to adopt. Published in The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism. The Google Books preview of the book contains this paper in its entirety. David Sobel, “The point of Self-ownership” (2018) - Consists largely of objecting to the response by Mack in his 2015 paper “Elbow Room for Rights”. He argues that Mack’s “elbow room postulate” cannot adequately handle the problem of minor intrusions without allowing for other conclusions that libertarians tend to reject.
