-- Metaethics

Normativity
- Intro
	- Examples
	- Contrast with descriptions
	- Plattitude
- Analysis (the structure of normative *language* - using strictly normative terms, not trying to reduce to non-normative terms)
	- Domains
		- Rationality
		- Goodness / Value
		- Epistemology
		- Aesthetics
		- Morality
		- Ettiquette
	- Flexibility of language
	- General: shoulds, justifications, warrant, etc. a relation involving an agent and an attitude. Grounds charges of criticism generally. 
	- Narrow: Reasons. A relation that grounds charges of irrationality specifically.
	- Kinds of reasons concepts
		- Normative vs non-normative "should" (e.g. "he should arrive here soon")
		- Explanatory vs Justificatory reasons
		- Intrinsic vs Instrumental
		- Objective vs Subjective reasons (e.g. reasons under lack of information)
		- Right/Wrong kinds of reasons
		- Internal vs External reasons
	- Other different categories of reasons
		- Deontic vs Evaluative (proposition P should be true versus agent A ought to acquire attitude X)
		- Agent-Neutral / Agent-relative
	- Not all based in pleasure/happiness
	- Not all based in teleology
	- Hierarchical structure, pro-tanto & prima facie
	- Works: Moore, Ross, Ewing, Sidgwick, Wiggins, McDowell, D'arms/Jacobson, Parfit, Raz

Normative Psychology (the *psychology* of normative judgments)
- Introduction: 
	- The problem and possible solutions
	- Descriptivism vs Non-descriptivism
	- Reasons judgments and motivation
- Failure of descriptivism 
	- Utilize common arguments
- Characterization of non-descriptivism
	- World-to-mind fit that cannot be otherwise reduced
	- Expressive of deliberative endorsement and prescriptive
	- Possibility of an alternative standard of truth
	- Competing motivational faculties
- Evolution: selections for descriptivism vs non-descriptivism
- Observations: examples of other evaluative language, normative education, emphasizing the dynamic component of certain terms (e.g. no one admits to being "racist" despite meeting the criteria)
- Objections:
	- Seems intuitively false
	- Frege-Geach
	- Which attitude
- Works: Stevenson, Ayer, Gibbard, Blackburn, Timmons/Horgan

Normative Correctness (the *correctness* of normative judgments)
- Introduction: 
	- The problem and possible solutions
	- Internalism vs Externalism
	- Connecting reasons and rationality/explanation
- Failure of externalism
	- Repeat many arguments from Williams's article
	- Use analogy with theoretical reasons
- Failure of broad internalism
	- Critique Williams's position
	- Use analogy with thoeretical reasons (e.g. desires don't justify beliefs, even if they can explain them).
- Constructivism
	- Normative judgments, not desires/sensations, provide reasons
	- Analogy with other domains
	- Constituitive features
	- Explaining intuitive reasons versus broad internalism, externalism, etc.
- Arguments:
	- Solid metaphysical/Epistemic gounding
	- Standards for procedural reasoning are required anyway.
- Objections
	- Methodology
		- General Theory unlikely
		- Conflicting reasons
		- Deliberation/reflection
- Works: Koorsgard, Street, Scanlon, Parfit, Frankfurt, Nagel, Gauthier

Moral Reasons
- Introduction: 
	- The Moral Problem - reconciling reasons and objectivity
	- Possible responses
- Viable Responses
	- Sentimentalism
	- Contractualism
- Methodology
	- General Theory unlikely
	- Conflicting interests
	- Argumentation/Discuss

Race and IQ
Group Success

More Unneeded Disputes
- Cause of racial IQ gaps
	- False dichotomy between genetics disparities and societal racism: There's a third option - internal environment. They aren't mutually exclusive - Accusations for/against racism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of the genetic differences.
	- Presumption that it influences solutions: Not necessarily. Two potential causes might require the same solution, e.g. if the cause is internal, it doesn't matter if it's culture or biology, the solution is the same. Incentivize people with good behaviors (whether due to biology or culture) to reproduce. This is lost if we ignore internal environment.
- Cause of gender differences in STEM:
	- False dichotomy between biology and sexism: there's a third option - different interests. They aren't mutually exclusive. Accusations for/against sexism require independent, direct evidence, regardless of cause of biological differences.
- Whether transgenderism is legitimate or a mental health issue: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced. Has no impact on whether such surgeries should be allowed.
- Whether preferred pronouns make sense: Has no impact on whether it should be governmentally enforced.
- There is male/white privilege (unintentional): Pointless, point directly to discrimination.
- There is white racism (intentional): Don't complain, beg for resect from oppressors. Instead, fight for rights (we already have that) and then use those rights to separate.

Miscellaneous
- Unnecessary Linguistic disputes (meaning of racism, moral terms, free will, knowledge, atheism, etc.)
- Unnecessary debates: when the truth of P is disagreed, but we agree that the truth of P reduces to S, and we agree on S
