<p>It is certainly possible that the Black-White IQ difference is largely genetic. There’s no law of biology that forbids this. After all, IQ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ">is largely heritable</a>, which means much of the <em>individual</em> variation in IQ is the result of genes. However, the extent to which IQ differences between Blacks and Whites (or any <em>groups</em>) is due to genes is a further question. To answer this question, we must <em>quantify</em> the genetic component of the racial IQ gap. So we need <em>direct</em> experiments/studies that isolate and quantify the environmental and genetic influences. Transracial adoption studies, I believe, are best suited to fulfill this purpose. I know of only four transracial adoption studies involving Blacks. I will consider each:</p>

<h3 id="problems-with-the-data">Problems with the data</h3>

<p>Focuses on upper-class successful families. Is this indicative of the Black community?</p>

<h3 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h3>

<p>It is believed by many that the fact that IQ is largely heritable and the mere existence of large IQ differences logically implies that a significant portion of these IQ differences are themselves due to genetics. But this is a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="current-iq-differences">Current IQ differences</h3>

<p>“One of the most serious misrepresentations in Rushton and Jensen’s (2005) article is their claim that the current difference in IQ between Blacks and Whites is slightly more than 15 points, or 1 standard deviation. The best evidence we have indicates that that value is out of date and that the Black–White IQ gap has lessened considerably in recent decades (Grissmer, 1994; Grissmer, Flanagan, &amp; Williamson, 1998; Grissmer, Williamson, Kirby, &amp; Berends, 1998; Hedges &amp; Nowell, 1998; Nisbett, 1995, 1998). We do not have actual IQ scores available to establish this point but rather various ability tests, most of which are highly correlated with IQ—some as high as .8 to .9. Though IQ scores would be preferable to speak directly to the question of IQ change, such data are unavailable in the form of a national random sample. In contrast, several probability samples of U.S. elementary and high school students are available. These include, over the period 1965–1994, the Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) survey, the National Longitudinal Study, the High School and Beyond survey, the National Education Longitudinal Study, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress program (NAEP).”</p>

<p>“The gap is substantially less than that at the present time, probably more like 0.6–0.7 standard deviation or approximately 10 IQ points.”</p>

<h3 id="exceeding-iq-expectations">Exceeding IQ Expectations</h3>

<p>“Data from the 1980 census show that the proportion of Chinese Americans employed in managerial, professional, or technical occupations was 55% and that of Japanese was 46%. (For Whites, the corresponding figure was 34%.) Using the well-established correlation between intelligence test scores and occupational level, Flynn (1991, p. 99) calculated the mean IQ that a hypothetical White group “would have to have” to predict the same proportions of upper-level employment. He found that the occupational success of these Chinese Americans - whose mean IQ was in fact slightly below 100 - was what would be expected of a White group with an IQ of almost 120! A similar calculation for Japanese Americans shows that their level of achievement matched that of Whites averaging 110.”

<p>“For eexample, Campbell and Ramey (1994) provided Black infants with an 8-hr per day intervention involving exercises designed to enhance cognitive, language, perceptual–motor, and social development. Mothers of the children had an average IQ of 85. At age 12, 56% of control children had IQs in the normal range (above 85), about what would be expected based on the mothers’ IQ and assuming that the fathers’ IQ was in the same vicinity. But 87% of children exposed to the intervention had IQs in the normal range. Only 13% of intervention-exposed children were of borderline IQ, and none were even mildly retarded. In contrast, 37% of control children were of borderline intelligence, and 7% were at least mildly retarded.”

<h2 id="transracial-adoption-studies">Transracial Adoption Studies</h2>

<h3 id="minnesota-transracial-adoption-study">Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study</h3>

<p>This one is fairly popular, so I need not give it too much detail. Basically, the study examined the IQs of mixed children, black children, and white children who were adopted by white families. The study found higher IQ for the whites adoptees compared to the black and mixed adoptees <a href="http://www.kjplanet.com/amp-31-10-726.pdf">[1]</a>. If this study did indeed equalize the environments for blacks &amp; whites, then the results would seem to indicate that the IQ gap is largely genetic. However, there are a few reasons to doubt that the study equalized the environments for blacks &amp; whites:</p>

<p>(a) the black children were adopted substantially later than the other children. The average white child was adopted at 19 months old, but the average black child was adopted at 32 months old <a href="http://www.kjplanet.com/amp-31-10-726.pdf">[2]</a>. The study showed that late adoptees had much lower IQs than early adoptees, e.g. black/mixed children adopted within one year of birth had a mean IQ of 99, whereas later adopted black/mixed children had a mean IQ of 92 <a href="https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-minnesota-transracial-adoption-study-a-follow-up-of-iq-test-performance-at-adolescence1.pdf">[3]</a> (there was no information on the effect of time of placement for the White children). Disparities in age of adoption could have instigated or exaggerated IQ disparities.</p>

<p>(b) Even though the study did somewhat equalize environments <em>after</em> adoption, it could not have equalized environments <em>before</em> adoption. This is particularly important given the late ages of adoption that I mentioned in (a). For example, a high blood lead level in infants can result in a noticeable reduction in IQ during adulthood: one study <a href="http://www.precaution.org/lib/low-level_lead_longterm_followup.19921001.pdf">[4]</a> found that a 10 μg/dL increase in blood lead level for infants aged 24-months was associated with a 5.8-point decline in their age-10 IQ, and an 8.9-point decline in their age-10 KTEA Battery Composite Score (normalized to a mean of 100 and SD of 15, just like IQ scores). Blood lead level might have been particularly important for the MTAS because, when it was first published in the 1970s, black children aged 6 months-5 years had much higher blood lead levels than similarly aged white children: over half of black children (52%) in this age range had a blood lead level greater than 20 μg/dL, compared to only 18% of white children <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad079acc.pdf">[5]</a>. Thus, blood lead level disparities (and any other potential pre-adoption environmental disparities) could have instigated or exaggerated IQ disparities.</p>

<p>It should be noted that despite little-to-no IQ gains, the black and mixed children saw much higher levels of academic achievement than their non-adopted racial peers. The mixed adoptees scored in the 60th, 59th, 50th, and 40th percentiles in vocabulary scores, reading scores, mathematics scores, and class rank, respectively <a href="https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/the-minnesota-transracial-adoption-study-a-follow-up-of-iq-test-performance-at-adolescence1.pdf">[6]</a>. For reference, the White adoptees scored in the 62th, 58th, 56th and 54th percentiles in those respective areas. The Black adoptees scored worse; they scored in the 54th, 48th, 36th, and 36th percentile. Considering the potential issues mentioned with (a) and (b), a 36 percentile is not <em>that</em> low (e.g. an IQ score in the 36th percentile is ~95). So while the black adoptees had significantly lower IQs, their academic achievement was not much lower than average.</p>

<p>In summary, ignoring the two issues raised by (a) and (b), this study seems compatible with a mainly genetic explanation of the IQ gap. However, the study is compatible with an environmental explanation of the <em>academic achievement</em> gap. Of the four adoption studies here, this is the study most in favor of a genetic explanation of the IQ gap, yet it <em>still</em> suggests that academic disparities are mainly environmental.</p>

<p>Other Problems:</p>

<p>“But perhaps the widening interracial differences in the MTRAS were genetically driven despite Rushton and Jensen’s error? Probably not, because attrition can explain the apparent widening. A total of 25 White adoptees were in the study when it began, nine of whom were lost at follow-up. The lost adoptees had relatively low IQs, so the remaining White adoptees were unrepresentatively high in IQ, as Mackintosh observed [25]. One can prove this by comparing the original IQs of the full sample and the subgroup who were measured at both ages 7 and 17; the latter subgroup had an initial mean IQ of 117.6 (with a minimum IQ of 92) but the full sample had an initial mean of 111.5 (minimum 62). Because initial and final IQs had a correlation of 0.63 among the White group, the elite subgroup would likely have had their final mean IQ inflated by about 0.63 × (117.6 − 111.5) = 3.8 points. Meanwhile, the BW and Black–Black adoptees lost to follow-up hardly differed in IQ from the remaining adoptees, so attrition inflated those groups’ mean IQs by about only 0.2 and −0.7 points respectively.”</p>

<p>“With the widening explained, the only racial IQ differences left to comment on are those present at initial testing. The scant initial gap of 2.5 ± 3.5 points between the fully White and BW adoptees is small enough to be simple statistical noise. Only the IQ of the Black–Black adoptees, who scored 12.2 ± 2.8 points below the BW adoptees, calls for a specific explanation. Differences in home environment are one possibility. On every reported environmental variable, the Black–Black adoptees were worse off than both the BW and fully White adoptees, which I quantify by comparing the former against the BW adoptees, measuring the environmental differences in BW SDs. I use the BW adoptees as a comparison group here because Scarr and Weinberg [13] present more data for BW adoptees than White adoptees. The Black–Black adoptees were older when adopted (by 2.1 SDs, or two years); had spent less time in their adoptive home (by 1.1 SDs); had more (by 0.4 SDs) and lower-quality (by 0.8 SDs) adoptive placements; and had adoptive parents with less education and lower mean IQ (by 0.2–0.3 SDs). Additionally, 97% of the BW adoptees had White mothers while the Black–Black adoptees all had Black mothers, with whatever prenatal environmental differences that entailed.”

<h3 id="german-iq-study-by-klaus-eyferth">German IQ study by Klaus Eyferth</h3>

<p>Psychologist Klaus Eyferth studied the IQs of white and mixed children in Germany. The mothers of the children were all white. Their fathers were either white or black members of the US occupation forces. The white children had a mean IQ of 97.2, whereas the mixed children had a mean of 96.5, a negligible difference <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyferth_study">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>There are some issues with this study, however. Firstly, the samples aren’t representative of the average population, because about 30% of black applicants were rejected admission to the armed forces, while only about 3% of whites were rejected. However, despite the unrepresentative sample, if racial IQ differences were mainly genetic, the white children should have had much higher scores than the mixed children because:</p>

<p>(a) The white GIs should have had higher IQs than the black GIs. Even though the admission test filtered out candidates below a certain threshold, the IQ scores for the white soldiers would <em>still</em> be distributed higher than that of the black soldiers (e.g. imagine removing all men and all women below 5’2 from the population; the resulting population would still have men taller than women, on average). If the IQ gap were mainly genetic, then this difference should manifest itself in their children.</p>

<p>(b) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability#Response_to_selection">Regression to the mean</a>. Even if we assume that the white and black soldiers had similar IQs, the black children should have had lower IQs than the white children because, assuming that the racial IQ gap is mainly genetic, the black children IQs would regress to the genetic black mean, while the white children IQs would regress to the genetic white mean. Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen, by far two of the most prominent supporters of genetic racial IQ differences, <a href="http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf">agree that</a> (go to section 9) this regression should occur insofar are racial IQ differences are genetic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For any trait, scores should move toward the average for that population. So in the United States, genetic theory predicts that the children of Black parents of IQ 115 will regress toward the Black IQ average of 85, whereas children of White parents of IQ 115 will regress toward the White IQ average of 100.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if racial IQ differences are mainly genetic, then regression to the mean should occur. This means that even if the black GIs and white GIs had similar IQs, the mixed children should have considerably lower IQs. Note that regression to the mean is found in other genetic traits such as height. This regression is quantified by geneticists by an equation known as “breeder’s equation”.</p>

<p>The study had other issues as well. For example, about 20-25% of the black GIs were actually French North African. Still, if racial IQ differences were mainly genetic, the remaining <em>75-80%</em> of the “mixed” children should have had below average IQs (for reasons given earlier), bringing down the total average for the “mixed” children considerably (unless the North African had extroadinarily large IQs to bring the average up, which we have no reason to assume). The lack of a considerable difference suggests a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.</p>

<h3 id="british-study-of-young-children-in-nurseries">British study of young children in nurseries</h3>

<p>In this study, psychologist Barbara Tizard studied black, white, and mixed children raised in British long-stay residential nurseries. The children were given psychological tests to determine their cognitive abilities. The scores were normalized to give a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 10. On the Reynell Comprehension test, the white children scored 102.6 and the black/mixed children scored 106.3. On the Reynell Expression test, the white children scored 98.5 and the black/mixed children scored 98.6. On the Minnesota Nonverbal test, the white children scored 101.3 and the black/mixed children scored 107.7 <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1127540.pdf?acceptTC=true">[8]</a>. Apparently there is a fourth test, but I didn’t manage to see it in the pdf. In any case, this study is compatible with a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.</p>

<h3 id="iq-scores-of-black-children-raised-by-white-families-versus-black-families">IQ scores of black children raised by White families versus Black families</h3>

<p>In this study, psychologist Elsie Moore compared IQ test scores among 23 black children adopted by middle-class white families and 23 age-matched black children adopted by middle-class black families. The black children adopted by black families scored a 104 IQ, while the black children adopted by white families scored a 117 IQ <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-24139-001">[9]</a>. These two groups of blacks likely differed in their <em>environment</em> and not their <em>genes</em>. Therefore, the difference in the black/white family environments likely accounts for the 13 IQ point gap. Keep in mind that the black &amp; white families were of similar socioeconomic status (middle-class). In actuality, the average black family has a much lower socioeconomic status than the average white family; therefore the difference in black/white environments would probably account for more than 13 IQ points. Clearly, this study is compatible with a mainly environmental explanation of the IQ gap.</p>

<p>The significance of the Moore study is not just the high IQ of the Black children; this demonstrates that the environment of the Black parents is not as conducive to cognitive development as the environment of the White parents. I don’t know the cause of this disparity (different people would argue for different causes, e.g. lead, peer groups, parenting, wealth, schools, culture, neighborhoods, etc.), but it’s clear from this study that Black and White <em>environments</em> have significantly different effects on IQ. And this environmental difference persists even though both groups of parents are <em>upper-middle class</em>. Imagine what the difference would be if we did <em>not</em> ensure that both parents were upper-middle class. If the Black parents were, say, disproportionately poor (as is the case in reality), then we would expect that 13-point IQ difference to widen.</p>

<h3 id="iqs-of-mixed-children-with-a-white-versus-black-mother">IQs of mixed children with a White versus Black mother</h3>

<p>“If the Black–White IQ gap is largely hereditary, then children having one Black and one White parent should have the same IQ on average, regardless of which parent is Black. But if one assumes that mothers are particularly important to the intellectual socialization of their children and if the socialization practices of Whites are more favorable to IQ development than those of Black mothers, then children of White mothers and Black fathers should have higher IQs than children of Black mothers and White fathers. This could of course not have a plausible genetic explanation. In fact, it emerges that children of White mothers and Black fathers have IQs 9 points higher than children with Black mothers and White fathers (Willerman, Naylor, &amp; Myrianthopoulos, 1974). This result in itself suggests that most of the Black–White IQ gap is environmental in origin. But because mothers are not the only environmental influence on the child’s IQ, the 9-point difference might be regarded as a very conservative estimate of the environmental contribution to the gap”</p>

<p>http://www1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Nisbett-commentary-on-30years.pdf</p>

<h3 id="follow-up-testing">Follow-up Testing</h3>

<p>Many have criticized the three latter studies because they did not do follow-up testing on the children. The claim is that the heritability of IQ increases as people age (which is true); thus the IQ gains from the improved environment may fade as the impact of environment diminishes with age. I have three responses to this:</p>

<p>(1) The potential decline in IQ gains for adopted children is not necessarily relevant. We are concerned with the IQ <em>gap</em> between blacks &amp; whites. The Minnesota Transracial Study implies that there is no significant change in the IQ <em>gap</em> after age 7, even though the IQ gains diminished for all racial groups. Looking at this study, the black-white IQ gap fluctuated by only about 2 points after age 7. Therefore, assuming that the MTAS study is representative in this regard, the lack of follow-up studies is no good reason to discount the latter three studies. The only transracial adoption study that we have which featured follow-up studies suggests that the racial IQ gap does not significantly widen with age. While adoption studies do indicate that IQ gains tend to diminish with age, as far as I know, there is no data indicating that the diminishment is particularly strong for Black adoptees compared to White adoptees.</p>

<p>(2) The heritability of IQ in children is fairly significant (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ">about 45%</a>), meaning genes play a significant role in the IQ of children. Therefore, if there were significant racial genetic IQ differences, then there would <em>not</em> be similar IQ scores for blacks and whites raised in similar environment <em>even as children</em>. Insofar as IQ is significantly heritable in children, and insofar as there are significant genetic racial IQ disparities, there will be a significant racial IQ gap at childhood even after equalizing environments. Therefore, the lack of an IQ gap during childhood after equalizing environments implies that either (a) the genetic component of IQ is not significant during childhood, or (b) there is no significant genetic Black-White IQ gap. We know that (a) is false, so (b) must be true.</p>

<p>(3) These IQ studies show that there are significant environmental differences between Black children who are adopted and those who are not (and between those adopted by White families versus Black families). It is unclear exactly what these environmental differences consists in. However, their mere existence indicates a predominantly environmental explanation of the IQ gap <em>at childhood</em>. Even if we remain agnostic about whether these differences explain much of the IQ gap in late adolescence, we can be confident that there is significant improvement that can be done regarding the IQ gap of Black and White <em>children</em>.</p>

<p>–&gt; Check if there are significant gaps between middle-upper class Black <em>children</em> (not teenagers/adults) versus middle-upper class White children on either academic achievement or IQ tests. If so, this has to be some environmental difference that is not just income (because we know children adopted by Whites do well on these tests). So this special environmental difference, whatever it is, persists across income levels.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It seems to me that the evidence suggests that the IQ gap is almost entirely environmental. The Minnesota study is the only adoption study that suggests otherwise, but it has flaws (as I’ve indicated earlier). The German study also has many flaws as well, but the latter two studies seem to support it. So three of the studies are compatible with a predominantly environmental explanation of the IQ gap. Taking a holistic account of all of the adoption studies seems to suggest that the IQ gap is, for the most part, environmental. The only way you could conclude otherwise is if you fully accepted the results of the MTAS and disregarded the latter three studies due to lack of follow-up testing. But even if so, then you would still have to admit that the <em>academic achievement</em> gap (arguably more important than IQ) in late adolescence is mainly environmental, and you would have to admit that the IQ/achievement gap at childhood is mainly environmental.</p>

<p>So the <em>best case scenario</em> for a genetic explanation of the IQ gap still implies that environmental differences explain most of the academic achievement gap. But if the races can attain roughly equal academic achievement, then I don’t really care about IQ differences. At the very least, we <em>know</em> that there is a significant environmental gap between Blacks and Whites that is plausibly responsible for much of the disparities we find in society today. Until we reach parity regarding academic achievement for Black &amp; White adults, and until we reach parity regarding IQ/achievement for Black and White children, there are still significant environmental gaps regarding intellectual development. Quantifying the precise proportion of the IQ/achievement gap that is due to environment (i.e. 40% or 80%) is important so that we know when we have exhausted the possible environmental efforts to reduce the gap. But we know we haven’t reached that point yet. Therefore, currently trying to precisely quantify the environmental proportion of the IQ/achievement gap serves more as a theoretical exercise than as a practical function. We can postpone answering questions about the exact genetic component of the gap until we know we’ve eliminated the significant environment differences. When that happens, the question will have more practical utility and we would likely be able to give more accurate answers.</p>

<p>So that’s all the data (that I’m aware of) that we have for transracial adoption studies with Black children. Even if you disagree with my interpretation, I hope that (at the very least) this post has been valuable as a coherent collection of all of the transracial adoption studies along with their biggest criticisms. With all of the raw data laid bare in one place, you can provide your own interpretation of the data that you find most compelling. Of course, there are very few of these adoption studies and many of them have several problems (which I hope to have made clear in this post), which means no interpretation is going to be perfect. Nevertheless, I believe the interpretation that I’ve provided here is the most reasonable response to the evidence.
