<p>Animals have desires and beliefs.
Both beliefs and desires are attitudes with proposition content.
“Belief” here is to be understood broadly as an attitude that is essentially representational.
Beliefs and similar attitudes are said to have a <em>mind-to-world</em> direction of fit.
The contents of these kinds of attitudes are aimed at matching or corresponding to reality.
A “desire” is to be understood as an attitude that is essentially dispositional.
Desires and similar attitudes are said to have a <em>world-to-mind</em> direction of fit.
These attitudes are such that the agent is disposed to modify the world to match the contents of the desire.
This characterization is just a rough sketch but it suffices for present purposes.</p>

<p>Hume noted that belief and desire are both necessary to explain and motivate intentional action.
Belief alone can never explain or motivate intentional action.
E.g. A’s belief that it’s raining cannot explain A’s motivation to wear an umbrella.
However, A’s belief that it’s raining <em>and</em> A’s desires to not be wet can explain A’s motivation to wear an umbrella.
In general, people with identical beliefs can have different action if they have different desires.
Likewise, desire alone can never explain or motivate intentional action.
E.g. A’s desire to not be wet cannot explain A’s motivation to wear an umbrella.
For example, if A believed it was not raining, A might not be motivated to wear the umbrella.
In general, people with identical desires can have different action if they have different beliefs.</p>

<p>These attitudes are shared with other animals.
When a dog rushes to the door excitingly at the sound of the doorbell, this can be explained (1) by a belief (or a similar mind-to-world attitude) that its owner is at the door and (b) by a desire (or a smiilar mind-to-world attitude) to see its owner.
One capacity that seperates us seemingly from most other animals is our capacity for self-reflection.
Many animals believe whatever they perceive. 
And they act according to whatever they desire at the moment.
There are some exceptions to this rule in particular contexts but nothing that seems to match the essentially deliberative and reflective nature found in normal humans.</p>

<p>This self-reflection allows us to have higher-order attitudes - attitudes about other attitudes.
We can form believes about our beliefs.
We can form desires about our desires.
We can form beliefs about our desires.
Perhaps, we can even have desires about our beliefs.
Some of these higher-order attitudes are normative judgments - judgments about what we ought to do or what we have reason to do.
More precisely, they are judgments about what attitudes we have reason to adopt.</p>

<p>As humans, our perceptions do not <em>always</em> produce corresponding beliefs.
We can step back from our perceptions and question whether we have reason to believe the appearances.
E.g. a person might experience certain perceptions due to a known optical illusion yet suspend belief in the information presented by their perception.
Nor do we always let desires produce action.
We can step back from our desires and question whether we have reason to act on a particular desire.
E.g. a person might have a strong desire to eat chocolate yet refrain from doing so if they know it isn’t good for them.
Unlike most animals whose base desires almost always drive their actions, humans are capable of <em>endorsing</em> certain desires over others.
In general, when we are unreflectively presented with certain inputs (such as a perception or desire), we can reflect and deliberate over whether we actually endorse those inputs as guiding our decisions, i.e. we can question what attitudes we ought to hold given those inputs.
This faculty of <em>deliberative endorsement</em> is what constitutes normative thinking and normative judgments.</p>

<p>The task here is to characterize the thoughts and attitudes involved in deliberative endorsement. 
Is it more like a belief which represents some kind of normative reality?
Or is it more like a desire that disposes agents to behave in certain ways?
When one makes a normative judgment, is this judgment capable of being true or false?
If normative judgments are like beliefs, what are they attempting to represent?
If they are like desires, then what kind of motivational states are they?
Before answering these questions, it makes sense to consider certain features of the endorsement involved with normative judgments.
Once we better understand what is involved with this kind of attitude, we will be better suited to answer the above questions.
I will be reviewing what I take to be four key features of normative judgments that must be accounted for by any characterization of normative thoughts.</p>

<h2 id="1-ubiquity">1. Ubiquity</h2>

<p>The first feature is the ubiquity of normative thinking. 
We find normative thinking everywhere in human lives. 
As already mentioned, we regularly endorse or reject beliefs and desires. 
E.g. we question whether our current and past perception provides us with reason for a belief, and we question whether our desires (and other attitudes) provides us with reason for action.
Normative thinking is also ubiquitous in another sense, in that it takes a wide variety of attitudes as its object.
Normative thinking is present whenever we are determining whether an attitude is <em>warranted</em>, <em>appropriate</em>, <em>justified</em>, <em>reasonable</em>, etc.
E.g. we question whether we have <em>reason</em> to have certain desires, whether fear is <em>justified</em> in certain contexts, whether we <em>should</em> admire certain people or certain acts, whether we <em>should</em> appreciate certain pieces of art, whether hatred or anger is <em>appropriate</em>, etc.</p>

<p>The precise terminology is not important.
Whether a person has a normative thought does not depend on whether they happen to use a particular term to express that thought, e.g. it doesn’t depend on whether they use the word “should”, “reason”, “justified”, etc. 
So trying to tie normative <em>thinking</em> to any necessarily normative <em>language</em> is not likely to be fruitful.
Normative terms are used here because they commonly refer to what we already understand to be normative thoughts.
However, these thoughts can be understood without reference to any particular terms.
In fact, we could even use prescriptive or declarative language to express normative thoughts without <em>any</em> normative terms. 
E.g. when a parent scolds their child and utters the prescriptive statement “Don’t hit people to settle disputes” or the declarative statement “We don’t hit each other to settle disputes!”, this can easily be understood as expressing the same thought as expressed by a normatively-laden statement such as “You <em>shouldn’t</em> hit people to settle disputes” or “It’s <em>wrong</em> to hit people to settle disputes”.</p>

<p>I take the idea of a normative thought or attitude to be basic, a kind of attitude familiar to all normal humans which can be better understood upon reflection.
Any agent who is unfamiliar with normative thoughts is unlikely to understand them through any kind of communication. 
It is impossible to explain what a kind of thought is like to a creature that has never experienced those thoughts or anything related to those thoughts. 
Just as it is impossible to explain what it is like to perceive certain colors to a blind person, it is also impossible to explain what it is like to have normative thoughts to someone who doesn’t already have them.
Creatures that do not have normative attitudes (e.g. think of creatures without higher-order attitudes, such as animals, young children, developmentally disabled adults, etc.) cannot hope to understand them.
Thus, I will be assuming we all have a shared understanding of normative thoughts and attitudes.
My task here is merely to point out features of normative attitudes to clarify this shared understanding.</p>

<p>All normative attitudes involve at least two entities: an agent A and some attitude X. 
All normative judgments can be reduced to: “A has reason to adopt attitude X”, “A ought to adopt attitude X”, “A is justified in adopting attitude X”, “it is appropriate for A to adopt attitude X”, etc.
Specific examples: we might judge that we have reason to go to a party (e.g. because it would make us happy), that we have reason to believe evolutionary theory over creationism, that we ought to admire generous people, that we have no reason to take our anger out the messenger, etc.
If we assumed that normative attitudes expressed truth-apt propositions (something which I do not assume at this point), then we can say they express that a relation holds between an agent and an attitude.</p>

<p>Note that not all instances of attitudes which can be the object of normative attitudes involve normative judgments.
Sometimes we are prompted with attitudes without reasoning.
For examlpe, a fear of spiders might be biological or instilled from environment, not because someone reasoned that they should fear spiders.
Many of our desires are not produced by reason; rather, they are simply inputs that we take into account during reasoning by deciding how much weight they should have in determining our action (which sometimes results in the desire disappearing after we realize the desire is unreasonable).s</p>

<p>I said before that all of normative thinking involves a judgment that an agent ought to adopt a certain attitude.
This implies that all normative concepts can be reduced to a relation involving an agent and an attitude. 
I believe this can be done with all actual normative concepts. 
Consider the following reductions of common normative concepts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“X is good” = “[some agent(s)] ought to <em>desire</em> X”</li>
  <li>“X is credible” = “[some agent(s)] ought to <em>believe</em> X”</li>
  <li>“X is morally wrong” = “[some agent(s)] ought not to <em>do</em> X” and/or “[some agent(s)] ought to <em>blame</em> those who do X”</li>
  <li>“X is beautiful” = “[some agent(s)] ought to <em>admire</em> or <em>appreciate</em> X”
etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, the terminology is not what’s important. 
In place of “reason” or “ought”, we could use any term that allows us to refer to a relation involving an agent and the <em>appropriate</em> or <em>justified</em> attitude.</p>

<p>There are two ways the normativity of belief can be misinterpreted.
Firstly, it should be noted that “X is credible” is not meant to be taken as “X is true”.
It is more akin to “X is justified”.
But we know there can be cases where a true belief is unjustified and cases where a false belief may be justified.
A belief is justified for a particular agent depending on whether that agent has evidence to support the belief.
A belief is true depending on whether it accurately corresponds to the world.
The former is a normative notion whereas the latter is a purely descriptive notion.
Secondly, the “ought” involved in the statement “X is credible” is not the same type of “ought” as in “X is morally obligatory”.
The former is concerned with epistemic justification, which is not identical to the justification involved with moral justification.</p>

<p>All normative concepts and thoughts are similar in that they are all concerned with a special kind of <em>endorsement</em> of a certain attitude.
They differ in terms of the attitude that the concept “calls for” or that the agent endorses.
There will be as many normative concepts as there are attitudes that can be subject to normative inquiry.
But what kind of attitudes can be subject to normative inquiry?</p>

<h2 id="2-motivation">2. Motivation</h2>

<p>I believe that the kinds of attitudes that can be subject to normative inquiry are what Thomas Scanlon calls <em>judgment-sensitive</em> attitudes.
This includes all attitudes X such that one’s judgment that they ought to adopt attitude X can in principle influence whether they actually adopt attitude X.
In other words, this includes attitudes whose adoption by an agent is influenced by that agent’s endorsement of the attitude.
As already mentioned, this includes beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.
One’s beliefs, desires, intentions, etc. are regularly changed depending on whether one thinks the beliefs, desires, intentions, etc. are warranted.
In the case of belief, this almost always happens immediately and without struggle.
E.g. if one judges that they have reason to believe X, they will almost always believe X.
In the case of desire or intention, there is a possibility for weakness of will.
E.g. sometimes a person thinks they have reason to do X, but they fail to do X because their degenerate desires (i.e. desires which they judge themselves not to have reason to give weight to) overpower their normative judgments.
E.g. one might judge that they have reason to study, but their desire to surf the internet wins out and they never study.</p>

<p>Other judgment-sensitive attitudes includes admiration, fear, anger, blame, pride, etc. 
All of these attitudes can in principle be motivated by judgments regarding their appropriateness.
Again, there are also regularly cases where one’s actual attitudes diverges from their normative judgments.
E.g. one might fear the dark even in contexts where they know they are safe and the fear is unjustified.
Insofar as one fails to adopt a judgment-sensitive attitude that they judge to be appropriate, they can be said to be <em>irrational</em>.
E.g. procrastinating when you know you shouldn’t, fearing the dark when you know you shouldn’t, etc. are all instances of irrational behavior.</p>

<p>Attitudes that cannot be the subject of normative inquiry are attitudes that are not judgment-sensitive. 
E.g. hunger, uncomfortableness, intoxicated, confused, having certain perceptions, etc.
These are attitudes or states of mind that one can adopt which are not influenced by one’s judgment of their appropriateness. 
E.g. it would not make sense to call someone irrational for <em>being</em> hungry, uncomfortable, intoxicated, confused, having certain perceptions, etc.
Of course, they might be irrational for earlier intentional actions that they did to make themselves, hungry, intoxicated, confused, etc. but the final attitudes themselves cannot be irrational, precisely because they are not influenced by normative judgments.
Because of this, these attitudes cannot be attributed to agents in the same way that judgment-sensitive attitudes can be attributed to agents. 
Judgment-sensitive attitudes can be attributed to agents because one’s judgment-sensitive attitudes indicates something about either their normative judgments (if they adopt the attitudes that they take to be appropriate) or their rationality (if they don’t adopt the attitudes that they take to be appropriate).</p>

<p>Because normative thinking only involves judgment-sensitive attitudes, this means that normative judgments must be intrinsically motivating.
Otherwise, no attitudes could in principle be influenced by one’s normative judgments, which means there would be no judgment-sensitive attitudes.
But if there are no judgment-sensitive attitudes, then normative thinking is not possible.
Since normative thinking clearly is possible, normative judgments must be intrinsically motivating.
An agent who comes to judge that they have reason to adopt attitude X must develop some motivation to adopt attitude X.
Note that this motivation is <em>defeasible</em>. 
The normative faculty is not perfect, because the normative faculty is not the only motivational system in humans.
As mentioned above, humans are motivated by normative judgments, but they are also motivated by other degenerate desires as well (e.g. desires that we do not endorse).
This occurs in everyday human life, especially for more impulsive people such as children or the mentally handicapped.
This covers the second feature of normative thinking: normative judgments are intrinsically motivating yet defeasible.</p>

<p>It might be questioned whether it makes sense to say that normative judgments must necessarily be intrinsically motivational if they are defeasible.
But we already accept this with other attitudes that are necessarily motivational.
E.g. desires are necessarily motivational states, but, for any particular desire, an agent might not act on that particular desire if they have a conflicting desire.
E.g. someone might desire to read a book, but a stronger desire to watch a movie might win out.
Likewise, a stronger desire might win out over a normative judgment.
Similar considerations apply to all attitudes like beliefs, fear, admiration, anger, etc. 
E.g. someone might judge that have no reason to be angry with someone, yet neverthless feel angry.
To endorse any of these attitudes entails some motivation, but it can be defeated by other base motivations.
Another way of putting it: normative judgments must be <em>capable</em> of motivating an agent to adopt the relevant attitude on its own, without the need to posit an additional desire.
In other words, the normative judgment that attitude X is appropriate entails a disposition to adopt attitude X, the same as any other motivational state such as a desire.</p>

<h2 id="3-disagreement">3. Disagreement</h2>

<p>The third feature of normative judgments is the possibility for normative disagreements.
Perhaps the most prominent case of this kind of disagreement concerns (normative) reasons for belief.
Most disagreements about what is true involve disagreements about what (normative) reason we have for belief.
E.g. imagine an atheist and a theist who agree with certain facts, e.g. that the universe is complex.
That might not only disagree over whether God exists, but they also disagree over whether a certain set of facts or observations (facts which they agree with) <em>justify</em> the belief in God, e.g. whether the complexity of the universe is a (normative) <em>reason</em> to believe in God.
It is a disagreement about what the <em>evidence supports</em>, which is a seperate question from what is true.
It is a question about what it is <em>appropriate</em> to infer given observations that we all agree with.
This is a normative dispute.</p>

<p>Similar disputes are had regarding the natural empirical world.
E.g. some pro gun-control advocates think that the <em>evidence indicates</em> that gun control reduces violent crime whereas some opponents think the opposite is supported by the evidence.
Again, these are seperate questions from what is true.
Whether a belief is justified for an agent depends on the evidence available to that agent.
Whether a belief is true is a seperate question.
A justified belief might be false and a true belief might be unjustified.</p>

<p>There are even arguments regarding more general principles for justifying beliefs.
There is agreement among most that certain methods of inference can justify beliefs. E.g. deduction, induction, abduction.
There is dispute about whether we are justified in relying on sense data, memories, inferring causation, etc. to form beliefs
There is dispute over various epistemic principles and how best to understand them: e.g. occam’s razor, whether falsifcation, verification, etc. are requirement of a scientific theory and what they consist in.
Most people accept these principles in at least some contexts.
The most extreme skeptics deny that they can ever justify a belief.
There are disagreements over general theories of justification. E.g. coherentism vs foundationalism.</p>

<p>The next most prominent form of normative disagreement is moral disagreement.
There is widespread disagreement over what we should do, who ought to be blamed for what actions, what kinds of beings deserve moral consideration, etc.
There are moral disagreements about political issues, e.g. what the government’s stance ought to be regrading abortion, immigration, taxation, welfare, affirmative action, free speech, etc.
There are moral disagreements regarding personal behavior, e.g. how one ought to treat their friends, loved ones, children, the appropriate standards for behavior in polite society and the ramification for failing to meet those standards.
We disagree with our friends, strangers in our society, strangers of other societies and cultures, about how people ought to behave and what ought to be acceptable.</p>

<p>There are moral disagreements about general ethical theories, often among philosophers. 
Consequentialists argue that actions are to be morally evaluated based on some relation to their consequent state of affairs.
Deontologists argue that actions are to be morally evaluated based on at least some features other than their consequent state of affairs.
Kantians argue that people are to never be treated as a mere means but always as an end.
Certain deontologists have certain rights that ought to never be violated for the sake of some overall good.
Certain anarchists argue that the initation of force is always wrong.
Hedonists argue that the only good thing is pleasure or happiness.
Pluralists argue that there are distinct and perhaps incomensurate types of value that cannot be reduced to any single good.
Generally speaking, when one person says “X is good” and another says “No, X is not good”, they have expressed <em>conflicting</em> attitudes.
Similar points apply when “good” is replaced with other common moral terms, such as “right”, “bad”, etc.</p>

<p>Similar disagreement (though often less heated) disagreement is found in other domains as well.
E.g. in aesthetics, people disagree over whether a piece of art is beautiful, whether someone is funny or not, whether a movie is good, etc. sAn analysis of normative terms must allow for and explain the conflict we regularly find in normative disagreements.</p>

<h2 id="4-non-empirical">4. Non-empirical</h2>

<p>Disagreement is so widespread in fact that two people can even agree that an object has certain physical properties while disagreeing on what attitudes are appropriate with regard to that object, without either person contradicting themselves.
This is due to the fourth and final feature of normative judgments: no set of empirical beliefs logically entail any set of normative judgments (or vice versa).
This relation is similar to the relation between beliefs and desire - no set of beliefs can logically entail any set of desires.
Just like any pair of beliefs and desire is possible, any pair of empirical beliefs and normative judgments is possible.
When a person judges that someone has reason to do something, we cannot infer that the judge also believes any particular <em>empirical</em> relation holds between the agent and the attitude.
E.g. two people might agree on all the relevant empirical facts regarding abortion, but still disagree over whether women should be able to perform abortions.
Also unlike empirical beliefs, we seem to discover normative truths a priori.
We ordinarily do not perform observations in the world to determine a normative truth.
Rather, we think conceptual analysis and reason alone is enough to establish normative truths.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Now that we have illustrated what I take to be the main features of normative judgments, we can now return to the original task.
We can now attempt to characterize the kind of attitude involved in <em>deliberative endorsement</em>. 
The characterization has to be one that can be applied to the normative judgments of virtually all people.
This universal characterization is required because it is necessary to ground a shared concept, and a shared concept is necessary for the genuine disagreements we have with others. 
Otherwise, these “disagreements” wouldn’t really be disagreements, we would just be talking past each other with different concepts.
E.g. if “good” for Adam meant “approved by society” and “good” for Bob meant “approved by God”, then when Adam says “X is good” and Bob says “No, X is not good”, what is really happening is Adam is saying “X is approved by society” and Bob is saying “No, X is not approved by God”. 
But this characterization of normative judgment clearly does not allow for a disagreement (there is no contradiction with X being approved by society and X not be approved by God).
Since Adam and Bob clearly do disagreement when one says “X is good” and the other says “No, X is not good” (i.e. Adam and Bob both judge that the other person is <em>incorrect</em>), this characterization does not suffice.</p>

<p>Possible characterizations can be broadly seperated into two categories - world-to-mind states of mind and mind-to-world states of mind.
Both are states of mind that that have propositional content as their objects, i.e. agents have beliefs and desires with regard to p where p is some proposition. 
Mind-to-world states of mind are states whereby the propositional content of the attitude is meant to <em>correspond</em> to an external reality. 
E.g. if one believes that p, then p is aimed at corresponding to reality. 
World-to-mind states of mind are states whereby the agent is disposed to modify the world so that the propositional content of the attitude is made true. 
E.g. if one desires that p, then they are disposed to try to make it the case that p is true. 
Whereas mind-to-world states have a <em>correspondence</em> role, world-to-mind states have a <em>dispositional</em> or <em>functional</em> role regarding one’s motivations.</p>

<p>How do we determine whether an attitude has a mind-to-world direction of fit or a world-to-mind direction of fit?
One test for the direction of fit of an attitude is to determine whether the attitude persists despite observing evidence against the propositional content of the attitude. 
For example, someone’s belief in p will tend to diminish upon observing evidence against p. 
E.g. if someone <em>believes</em> that their home football team will win the game tonight, this will (usually) tend to diminish as they observe evidence that the team will lose, e.g. if the home team loses their best player, then this will diminish one’s belief they they will win. 
On the other hand, if one <em>desires</em> that their home team win, then this attitude (usually) does not tend to diminish upon observing that the team will lose, e.g. if the home team loses their best player, then this will <em>not</em> diminish one’s desire that they win.
Like most desires, the desire here persists despite evidence against the truth of the corresponding propositional content.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that normative attitudes have a world-to-mind direction of fit.
That is, when a person endorses A’s adoption of attitude X, this does not tend to diminish as one learns that A fails to adopt attitude X.
This to me lends evidence to a non-cognitive analysis of normative judgments.
This implies that normative judgments are not <em>beliefs</em> or other cognitive states that represent a normative reality. 
Rather, they are sophisticated forms of desire-like states (or dispositions to have certain desire-like states).
However, other theories of normative talk purport to explain the appearances better. 
These theories are discussed in “Theories of Normative Talk”.
In the end, I believe that non-cognitivism is the best account of our normative thinking.</p>
