Note that this does not reduce internalism to an Actual Motivational view whereby an agent needs to be actually motivated to perform the action. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of <em>ideal</em> deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of <em>sound, valid, fully imaginative</em> (from Williams) deliberation. Other forms of internalism might require being in a sound state of mind, having full experience, etc. In other words, normative reasons are the rational extension of one’s motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is some rational procedure from an agent’s motivational reasons to C (without presupposing any new motivational states along the way).</p>

<p>??? question “Some questions left unanswered”
	- How to distinguish well-being (what makes a life go best) from reasons for action/desires? 
		- Some differences:
			1. X might provide high well-being without an agent having reason to X, e.g. experience machine, animals, etc.
			2. It is sensible to ask whether an agent has reason to do something that promotes their well-being due to some other end.
		- Reasons for action/desire = considerations in favor of an action, whether the agent knows it or not.
		- Well-being = how an agent assesses their own life to be going from their first-personal perspective, possibly under idealized conditions.
	- I understand the argument that there is no normative truth independent of normative judgments (i.e. the metaphysical/epistemological/motivational problems with realism).. But how do we establish that normative truth for a given agent’s depends on <em>that</em> agent’s normative judgments? E.g. why not the normative judgments of the agent’s community? Or the normative judgments of the speaker? Why not understood “reasons” broadly as a standard by which to criticize someone, e.g. because people are subject to criticism for being cruel, and because reasons are standards of criticism, why not say cruel people are unreasonable? There are infinitely many possible theories of normative truth that don’t reduce normative truth for A to A’s normative judgments, without also having the metaphysical/epistemological problems of realism. 
		- We can understand “should” claims as general standards to ground criticism, e.g. people “should” not act immorally, even though they may have no reason not to do so.
		- “Reasons” may be sometimes used in this broad sense, but for clarity this concept will be identified with the narrow sense (connected with an agent’s normative judgments) leaving “should” the job of handling general grounds for criticism. 
		- A motivational argument can be given perhaps. 
		- Kosgaard’s states that such an account is the only thing that can explain the normative authority of deliberation for agents. What does this mean?
		- Why focus on reasons in the internal sense? Similar considerations can be used to explain why reasons for belief are internal rather than external (i.e. rather than simply beliefs that are true).
		- The internal sense is what we use not just for charges of criticism but for charges of irrationality.
		- The internal sense is the kind of reason we acknowledge when we judge that something is a reason from a first-person perspective rather thana third-person perspective.
	- What is the general strategy for determining what is constitutive of a given activity?
	- What are the procedures for ideal deliberation?
	- Why do some attitudes have higher authority over others, i.e. the attitude that values the upshot of idealized reflection are more important than an agent’s present desires.

<h2 id="existence-internalism">Existence Internalism</h2>

<p>Some twists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Externalism too broad, move to internalism.</li>
  <li>Actual motivations too narrow, require idealized conditions.</li>
  <li>Not all actual states provide reasons, move to constructivism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider analogy with theoretical reasons along the way.</p>

<p>Varieties of internalism:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual Motivation: A has reason to X only if A is motivated to X.</li>
  <li>Actual State: A has reason to X only if A has some motivational attitude that supports doing X.</li>
  <li>Counterfactual Motivation: A has reason to X only if A would be motivated to X under circumstances C.</li>
  <li>Counterfactual State: A has reason to X only if A would have some motivational attitude that supports doing X under circumstances C.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Motivation views, “is motivated” and “can be motivated” don’t just mean some motivation that may be overridden by other motivations. It means the source of an agent’s volition that drives them to act intentionally. For State views, a Motivational attitude is a certain kind of psychological state which plays a role in motivation. These states are often taken to be desires, but can include other attitudes such as emotions, intentions, and aversions. Motivation views do not, by themselves, require the presence of any particular kind of psychological state which does the motivating, and State views do not, by themselves, require that the motivating state which is present actually does any motivating.</p>

<p>It is a platitude about reasons and rationality that: R is a normative reason for A to X iff R would be a motivating reason for A to X if A were rational and A was aware of R. In other words, reasons are the upshot of full rationality and full information. The question is how to characterize rationality. Internalism gives a <em>procedural</em> characterization of rationality. It usually specifies a form of ideal <em>deliberation</em>, i.e. of moving from certain motivations to action and other motivations. Externalism specifies an <em>substantive</em> characterization of rationality that specifies certain substantive elements like “a motivation to help others”. i.e. being rational might require being converted rather than sound reasoning.</p>

<p>The above is a true platitude only if we use a fairly broad definition of rationality. But Scanlon narrows rationality to just doing that which you judge yourself to have reason to do. Which means to be irrational is to fail to adopt the attitudes that one judges themselves to have reason to adopt. This makes sense to me. I wouldn’t call someone irrational if they failed to do what they would do if they reflected more or were more experienced. “Rationality” as used above seems to simply mean “idealized person”.</p>

<p>Existence internalism characterizes rationality without explicitly requiring any particular motivations. Note that this does not reduce internalism to an Actual Motivational view whereby an agent needs to be actually motivated to perform the action. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of <em>ideal</em> deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of <em>sound, valid, fully imaginative</em> (from Williams) deliberation. Other forms of internalism might require being in a sound state of mind, having full experience, etc. In other words, normative reasons are the rational extension of one’s motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is some rational procedure from an agent’s motivational reasons to C (without presupposing any new motivational states along the way).</p>

<h3 id="motivational-argument-1">Motivational Argument 1</h3>

<p>One argument for internal reasons states that reasons must be capable of motivating action.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R is characterized as propositions.</li>
  <li>A motivational set is merely a set of dispositions towards behaviors under certain beliefs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The argument:</p>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A were fully rational.</li>
  <li>A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>The central question here is (2). (1) and (3) are both a priori, conceptual truths. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements, so may seem to be question-begging. We need to give an independent argument for (2), in a way that explains how to pick out which dispositions provide reasons.</p>

<p>Modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Fully Rational” may need to be explicitly characterized in terms of “ideal sound deliberation” or something more specific, so that (2) is not seen as question-begging against the (rare) externalist who says that full rationality might endorse behaviors for A that A has no dispositions to do.</li>
  <li>From Scanlon: One option is to characterize “rationality” just in terms of consistency. So that one is irrational only if they fail to adopt an attitude that they do not judge themselves to have reason to have.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Procedural rationality</strong></p>

<p>This is to support (2) of the explanatory argument: A, if fully rational, would be motivated to X by believing R only if A is disposed to X by believing R. (2) depends on whether we take rationality to have substantive or procedural requirements. We need an independent argument for procedural rationality to support (2). And we also need to explain why it’s not just any ol’ dispositions that are needed to supply an agent with reasons for action, i.e. an agent might have a disposition to overvalue short-term gains at the expense of long-term losses, but this <em>mere</em> disposition is not what grounds any reasons to value short-term gains as one might think from (2). Instead, what matters is what dispositions that agent actually endorses under deliberation. But now we seem to be making the deliberative argument below:</p>

<h3 id="motivational-argument-2">Motivational Argument 2</h3>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if A would be motivated to X by believing R insofar as A deliberated soundly.</li>
  <li>A would be motivated to X by believing R under sound deliberation only if A is disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then A is not disposed to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, (1) needs to be argued for, as it is no longer merely a plattitude. It almost may seem to be question-begging against the externalist. We might be able to accept (1) if we accepted constructivism. Normative truth derives from the normative judgments an agent makes, and it is constituitive of agency to value one’s motivations under deliberation. So we just need to argue for constructivism.</p>

<h3 id="rational-argument">Rational Argument</h3>

<p>–&gt; “A judges that he has reason R to X” entails</p>

<ol>
  <li>For A to judge that he has reason to X entails that A would be irrational, from his own perspective, for A to not be motivated to X.</li>
  <li>…</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ol>

<p>This differs from the motivational arguments in two respects:
(1) It deals with the conditions necessary for someone to <em>judge</em> that they have a reason, rather than the conditions necessary for a reason to <em>apply</em> to them. Thus, it deals with the concept of a reason in this sense.
(2) Rationality here is not just defined as being receptive to reasons. Rather, it is supposed to be the kind of irraitonality related to not responding to standards that he holds himself to.</p>

<p>The idea is that there is this narrow concept of a reason which we ordinarily use. This concept is distinct from external reasons which serve as broad groads for criticism. E.g. if a “reason” is simply an external ground for criticism that comes from some evaluative perspective, e.g. a perspective of ettiquette, then it would not be irrational for someone to say that they have a reason to be kind (if they understand that “reason” in this to be standards generated from the ettiquette perspective) while lacking any motivation to be kind. On the other hand, it <em>would</em> be irrational for someone to say that they have a reason to X (if they understand “reason” in this sense to be internal to their own motivational sources) while lacking any motivation to X. This latter concept of reason is more closely related to rationality. Where rationality is defined in procedural terms, for reasons to be explained below. In particular, these reasons must be not just internal to their motivational set, but to their normative judgments (see constructivism).</p>

<h3 id="explanatory-argument">Explanatory Argument</h3>

<p>Normative reasons are counterfactual explanatory reasons (Michael Smith w/out ideal observer).</p>

<ol>
  <li>R is a reason for A to X only if R could explain why A would X under sound, ideal deliberation.</li>
  <li>That A is motivated to X by believing R can be explained only by something in A’s desires, goals, etc. favoring doing X by believing R.</li>
  <li>If R is an external reason for A to X, then there is nothing in A’s desires, goals, etc. that motivate a sound, deliberative A to X by believing R.</li>
  <li>Therefore there are no external reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note we have (1) which is not a plattitude which one might object to. However an argument for (1) might be: (1) should be accepted by considering the cases where we perform actions because of normative reasons. The times where there is a disconnect between our motivating and normative reasons, we can point to some sort of problem, either we aren’t aware of the reasons, we have false information, we suffer from addition, etc.</p>

<p>The reason that reasons statements are not based on the hypothetical motivational sets of e.g. a fully moral A, i.e. A+, is because it is important that reasons statements apply directly to A. Note, however, that we can still focus on the somewhat idealized A who has deliberated, because we can infer that A already values the motivations of himself after he has deliberated. We can infer this from the fact that he is in fact deliberating. So he already values his deliberation.</p>

<p>But why should reasons statements for A be based on what he actually values in any present moment? This seems question-begging against the externalist. Two reasons (1) We make claims about reasons for the purpose of influencing, motivating, or guiding agents. But the only thing that can guide agents (assuming they don’t suffer from addictions, false beliefs, etc.) are elements from their motivational set. And (2) this is a basic premise of constructivism (see below).</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-theoretical-reasons">Focus on Theoretical Reasons</h3>

<p>(not a different argument from above; perhaps an elaboration of the explanatory argument).</p>

<p>Points to be learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existence internalism may seem to be disproven by theoretical reasons because beliefs are justified by features other than one’s motivational set (i.e. one’s desires).</li>
  <li>However, the motivational set for beliefs wouldn’t just be desires; it would be other beliefs, perceptions, judgments, intuitions, etc. And these DO justify beliefs.</li>
  <li>Not all elements from one’s motivational set are relevant. E.g. desires don’t justify beliefs.</li>
  <li>Which elements are relevant?</li>
  <li>Why are those elements relevant?</li>
  <li>The relevant elements are the agent’s normative judgments.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, there is a narrow and broad sense of normative judgments. The broad sense refers to general “should” statements that could simply serve as standards by which we can criticize and evaluate the behavior of others - this includes internal and external reasons. There is also a narrow sense that refers to internal “reasons” statements. The question is why this distinction is important and what is special/important about internal reasons statements.</p>

<p>Consider reasons for belief. One could say that one has reason to believe just whatever is true. In a sense, this could be true. But it seems that there is another, independent role played by reasons statements about belief. Reasons in this more narrow sense are conferred to considerations that guide our deliberation as we decide what to believe. The fact that something is an external reason for belief - the fact that it’s true, for example - cannot be a consideration that one takes to be reason to decide their belief. I.e. if you asked someone why they believed X and they responded with “because X is true”, this would do nothing to explain their belief. We expect them to respond with an accessible feature of their motivational set - e.g. their other beliefs, their intuitions, their normative judgments, etc. Likewise, external reasons for action cannot be a consideration that someone takes to be a reason for action, unless we assume it’s already connected with their motivational set. E.g. if you asked someone why they did X, and they responded with “because X is kind” (yet they had no care for kindness), this wouldn’t really explain why they did X.</p>

<h3 id="procedural-rationality">Procedural Rationality</h3>

<p>There are two types of reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Internal: What could be entailed from the appropriate elements of an agent’s motivational set via some idealized procedure or set of conditions. The rational extension of one’s motivational set.</li>
  <li>External: general grounds for criticizing an agent, i.e. broad use of “should”. A general positive status that we confer to behaviors that we approve of.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why is the distinction important and what is special/important about internal reasons statements?</p>

<p>Consider the earlier discussion of theoretical reasons. That is, reasons for beliefs must be internal to an agent’s perceptions, intuitions, etc. even though there is a sense in which it is appropriate to confer a positive status to certain beliefs on the basis of external reasons i.e. their truth. The reason is because, regardless of the appropriateness a attitude on externalist grounds, we <em>need</em> a system to confer status to attitudes on internalist grounds. There are times when we don’t have access to considerations that warrant approval of certain attitudes. In those circumstances, we still need to make a choice. Thus, we need a procedure that determines which attitudes are worth adopting. And we need an element of language to play this role in explaining this status. Internal reasons statements play this role.</p>

<p>When we deliberate, we are trying to answer the question of which attitudes to adopt. During theoretical reasoning, we are determining what beliefs to adopt. During practical reasoning, we are determining what intentinos to adopt. Because theoretical reasoning involves determining whether a given proposition, say, P is true, the <em>mere fact that P is true</em> cannot possibly serve as a reason to believe P; at least not when “reason” is understood as the status we confer to beliefs during deliberation about what to believe. From the agent’s perspective, s/he begins unsure as to whether or not P is true and is trying to answer that question. He thus cannot use <em>the fact that P is true</em> as a reason to believe P. Similar considerations apply to practical reasoning. Practical reasoning involves determining whether a given intention X is to be adopted. Therefore, the <em>mere fact that X is virtuous or kind or fair</em> cannot serve as a reason to do X. Again, the agent begins unsure as to whether virtue or kindness or fairness is a reason to intend to something. Thus, the mere fact that an action has these properties cannot be taken as a reason for an intention. In general when deliberating, the only considerations that we can appeal to as reasons for action are considerations that we already accept to be reasons for action. There is no normative truth outside of what we take to be normative.</p>

<p>The very activity of normative reasoning is to address conflicts in motivations. The problem to which normative thinking is designed to address is conflicts in our motivations. This means that normative thinking is not designed to track any mind-independent truth. Evenif it can be said that there is some mind-independent truth external to the world of the relevant kind, there is no way that this could relate to normative reasoning. Normative thinking is only answerable to our given motivations and normative judgments.</p>

<h3 id="constructivist-argument">Constructivist Argument</h3>

<p>Constructivism + Judgment Internalism = Existence Internalism</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constructivism: A has a reason to X only if A’s normative judgments in some sense endorse X-ing.</li>
  <li>Judgment Internalism: A’s normative judgments endorse X-ing only if A has some motivation to X.</li>
  <li>Existence Internalism: A has a reason to X only if A has some motivation to X.</li>
</ol>

<p>Constructivism is actually a narrow form of existence internalism if we accept judgment internalism and if we believe one can have motivating reasons without judging them to be normative reasons. In that case, the motivating reasons corresponding to one’s normative judgments would be a strict subset of their motivational set. Of course, there is still the question of why we should accept constructivism in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="constructivism">Constructivism</h2>

<p>Three categories of normative judgments</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constituitive: normative judgments held by all agents insofar as they are rational</li>
  <li>Internal: normative judgments held by a particular agent, i.e. narrow use of “reason”. Or what is entailed from an agent’s normative judgments.</li>
  <li>External: grounds for criticizing an agent, i.e. broad use of “should”</li>
</ol>

<p>The question is why does the internal/external divide matter and why do internal reasons count as real reasons?</p>

<p>The answer is this: There is a sense of reasons such that if an agent fails to do what <em>he judges</em> to be a reason R, then he is irrational. But this can be true only if the agent judges R to be an internal reason. I.e. if an agent fails to do what he <em>endorses</em> (i.e. an internal reason judgment), then he is irrational. But if he fails to do what he judges to be endorsed from some other perspective (which would be an external reason judgment), e.g. the moral perspective, then he is not being irrational. So reasons in the sense of being connected with rationality or irrationality must be internal. The property of <em>being a reason</em> is a status we confer give to considerations that we endorse upon deliberation.</p>

<p>The question now is why assume rationality cannot be broadened to include substantive normative judgments, so that someone who fails to respond to e.g. moral reasons are irrationality beause rationality requires being moral?</p>

<p>Some Arguments</p>

<ol>
  <li>Little ontological baggage.</li>
  <li>Allows for a credible epistemology.</li>
  <li>Explains many constituitive properties of certain normative domains.</li>
  <li>Explains existence internalism (assuming we accept judgment internalism).</li>
  <li>Doesn’t seem like reasons can be discarded as meaningless. One can’t ask “why be rational”.</li>
</ol>

<p>See: Christine Korsgaard, Sharon Street, (Bernard Williams?)</p>

<p>The fact that X is a reason to Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgment that X is a reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of A’s other judgments about reasons. Note that X is never a reason in favor of Y, absolutely. X can only be in favor of Y for some particular agent, as determined by the standards set by the normative judgments of A himself.</p>

<p>A normative judgment withstands scrutiny for an agent only if the agent could mantain the judgment in full awareness, which is determined by the constituitive standards of the attitude in question. For example, someone who judges that X is a reason to Y cannot also simultaneously and in full awareness judge that X is not a reason to Y (consistency is constitutive of normative judgments). Also, one cannot take oneself to have conclusive reason to Y without taking oneself to have reason to take the means to Y (means-end reasoning is constituitive of normative judgments). The force of <em>cannot</em> is not rational, but what is <em>constituitive</em> of the concept of forming normative judgments. These standards of correctness are legislated by the very person making the normative judgments. This allows that one can be genuinely mistaken about their normative judgments only insofar as they are not in full awareness of certain relevant features of their judgments.</p>

<h3 id="disallowing-brute-error">Disallowing Brute Error</h3>

<p>See “Constructing Ortagorean Objectivity.md”</p>

<h3 id="theory-of-error">Theory of Error</h3>

<p>The basic idea is that we have reason to adopt attitude X if adopting attitude can be entailed from our current set of judgments.
But how to account for agents who have false normative judgments?
After all, such judgments are a part of their judgments, so it can be said to be “entailed” from their current set of judgments.</p>

<p>The answer is that some normative judgments are strictly of higher priority than others. 
There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Judgment A sets the context for when judgment B is relavent. E.g. the difference between endorsing what you would endorse if unemotional, fully reflective, etc. versus what one endorses in the heat of the moment. The former is an endorsement about the kinds of conditions that determine when one’s actual endorsements are valid.</li>
  <li>Judgment A is constituitive of the very activity. Thus, it cannot be discarded in favor of A. E.g. judging that one has reason to adopt the means to meet an end is constitutive of adopting the end.</li>
  <li>Judgment A is extremely difficult to get rid of. E.g. relying on induction, memories, perceptions, caring about our future selves, etc. In fact, insofar as someone were able to not rely on these features, they would have psychological states completely unlike anything of our own.</li>
</ol>

<p>Part of the practice of establishing normative attitudes is establishing attitudes that regulate other attitudes.
There is a hierarchy of normative judgments abound.
Other considerations for favoring one judgment over another:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is more likely to acccomplish
If there is no significant difference in any of the points mentioned above between two potential normative judgment, there is not necessarily a more “correct” position to adopt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-conceptions-of-truth">Alternative conceptions of truth</h3>

<p>There are plenty of other domains of propositions whereby truth is based on something other than correspondence. The general structure is that one takes an attitude with regard to a proposition p, and then finds standards of correctness constituitive of the attitude. Consider the following examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Descriptive judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a description D and reality R, namely that D represents R. S is true if and only if D represents reality.</li>
  <li>Logical judgments: Judgment S expresses a relation involving a set of propositions P1 and another set of propositions P2, namely that P1 entails P2, i.e. the truth values constitutive of P1 are also constitutive of P2. S is true if and only if P1 entails P2.</li>
  <li>Modal judgments:</li>
  <li>Probabilistic judgments:</li>
  <li>Causal judgments:</li>
  <li>Counterfactual judgments:</li>
</ul>

<p>Rational Judgments</p>

<ul>
  <li>Epistemic Rationality:</li>
  <li>Prudential Rationality:</li>
  <li>Moral Rationality:</li>
</ul>

<p>Under constructivism, for normative judgments, truth is not based on some correspondence to some mind-independent normative reality. There is no standard of correctness for normative judgments independent of what we ourselves decide to be valuable. There is no sense in determining that someone has a reason to do something if it cannot be inferred from what they actually judge themselves to have reason to do.</p>

<p>If we remain committed to the correspondence theory of truth, we can abandon truth-aptness. Normative judgments are rationalility-apt. Normative propositions have the property of being rational or irrational, whereas descriptive propositions have the property of being true or false. Ascriptions of rationality can be siblings to ascriptions of truth, while not being reduced in those terms. This can be considered a form of quasi-truth. All the purported values of cognitivism can be withheld:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normative thinking is a rational enterprise.</li>
  <li>Certain normative judgments are better than others.</li>
  <li>The better normative judgments are independent of our actual judgments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="constituitive-features">Constituitive Features</h3>

<p>The central question is how to determine what requirements are constitutive of a type of behavior. One candidate is this: a requirement is constituitive of a behavior if no agent could consciously reject the requirement in full awareness.</p>

<p>Logical Consistency. One basic constituitive feature of normative judgments (and thuoghts generally) is logical consistency. No person can consciously believe X and believe not-X in full awareness.</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Consistency: Consistent/Coherent norms trump inconsistent/incoherent norms (This is required for all other constituive features to have force). Without a concern for consistency, an agent could not count as a normative reasoning agent. The very activity of normative reasoning is to address conflicts in motivations.</li>
  <li>Soundness: Norms endorsed under a sound state of mind trump norms endorsed under psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc.</li>
  <li>Deliberation: Norms endorsed under deliberation trump unreflective dispositions that we discard under deliberation.</li>
  <li>Experience: Norms that maintain endorsement upon experiencing their outcome trump ends which are not.</li>
  <li>Full Information: Norms endorsed with full information trump norms based on false beliefs?</li>
</ol>

<p>Stability?
Commonality?</p>

<p><strong>Epistemic</strong></p>

<p>The normativity of beliefs (against people who think the normativity of beliefs just reduce to their truth, so normativity is descriptive):</p>
<ul>
  <li>We are all familiar with the idea of justifying beliefs. I.e. people who believe in Santa Clause who are exposed to the appropriate evidence have unjustified beliefs, people who believe in God (or lack belief if you’re religious), people with opposing beliefs about the efficacy of gun control, etc.</li>
  <li>Justification and truth are separate concepts, i.e. a belief can be justified yet false or unjustified yet true. So justification cannot be descriptive, as it is not concerned with truth.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Normative principles come prior to descriptive beliefs. We need normative principles to establish descriptive beliefs. We need a procedure to proceed from evidential input - i.e. sensory perceptions, memories, intuitions, etc. - to belief outputs. We must establish what counts as evidence to make this inference. Deductive reasoning is required at a minimum. But this is not sufficient, we need induction, abduction, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Deductive:
    <ul>
      <li>Basic constistency: we cannot believe P and ~P.</li>
      <li>Logical rules of inference: if P-&gt;Q and P, then Q.</li>
      <li>Constraints on thought. We cannot help but follow logical constraints in our thinking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Subjective:
    <ul>
      <li>Perceptions/memories: the reason that a perception that p provides one with reason to believe that p is because part of what it is to perceive p is to acquire an unreflective belief that p. If perceptions didn’t provide one with an unreflective belief that p, then perceiving that p would be like imagining that p, and this would not provide one with a reason to believe p. Similar considerations apply to memories.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Abduction:
    <ul>
      <li>Falsifiability</li>
      <li>Generality</li>
      <li>Parisomony (Occam’s Razor)</li>
      <li>Explanatory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Induction:
    <ul>
      <li>Past -&gt; Future</li>
      <li>Observed -&gt; Unobserved</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are either:
	- Constraints on our thoughts. We cannot help but believe them. Or,
	- Things we don’t <em>have</em> to trust, but which we just so happen to do. This isn’t just something that individuals happen to trust, but that everyone happens to trust. If there were beings that didn’t abide by induction or abduction, then we wouldn’t call them irrational; they just wouldn’t have cognitive structures like our own. Normativity only deals with resolving conflicts. Thus, if induction, abduction, etc. are already adopted by most people, then we don’t need to justify them.</p>

<p>This seems to be too low of a standard. It seems we can still question the validity of a belief system that is internally coherent and held by everyone else. E.g. think about beliefs about God back when everyone was religious. Why is this unjustified? Appeal to a more foundational principle that we all intuitive adopt, which is abduction. How do we know that abduction is more foundational than beliefs about God? (1) abduction is not a belief in that it is representation; it is a framework for establishing representations. (2) God is something we come to believe after engaging in abduction. (3) everyone participates in abduction, not everyone participates in believing God. Someone might say that they specifically place God on a more foundational level than abduction, but then their position wouldn’t be reasonable for other people. And usually, when we say X provides a reason to believe Y in circumstances C, we take that to be a universal claim, i.e. <em>every</em> agent has reason to take X to provide reason to believe Y in circumstances C.</p>

<p>Reason is purely procedural. It is concerned with amelierating <em>conflicts</em> and striving for <em>coherence</em> of our aims. Beliefs are not justified in isolation. Rather they are justified based on their coherence with other beliefs. It may seem that all propositions must be justified in a non-circular non-infinite regress, and any beliefs that cannot be justified are irrational. This is the case only because of the context of ordinary uses of “rational” or “irrational”. When we talk of “rational” in the context of a debate, it usually applied to propositions that can be justified to all parties involved. However, even though propositions may not be justifiable in this sense (in the sense of collective support), they can justifiable to an individual (based on their coherence with the individual’s other beliefs). The “rational” sense as used in collective support is not constituitive of rationality itself (i.e. agents can be rational without jutsifying themselves to others), but having debates with others implicitly commits oneself to a constructed “game” where the rules are intersubjective justifiability.</p>

<p>Objectivity: imagine people have widely divergent beliefs. Objectivity is possible when there happens to be an intersection in the beliefs held by these people. More specifically, it’s possible when there is an intersection in what these people judge to be solid methods for establishing truth. E.g. think of science. People might have widely different beliefs. But everyone agrees that one’s beliefs should cohere with their other beliefs, and we happen to be beings with sensory inputs that automatically impress beliefs within us (which means our beliefs must cohere with our sensory inputs), and our sensory inputs happen to converge a lot of the time. There are other features we happen to agree with as well (or can be shown to agree with), e.g. repeated observations from different independent sources/experiments provide more evidence for a hypothesis than one-offs, etc. It is this convergence that grounds the objectivity of science. I.e. two people might disagree over whether theory X or Y is true, but they can agree on method for determining whether X or Y is true, e.g. by appealing to observation, abduction, induction. Without this, objectivity is impossible. Even if we disagree on method, we can ideally point to a meta-principle that we both agree with (or can be shown to agree with) that settles which method is valid (e.g. reflective equilibrium).</p>

<p>Methodology:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no exhaustive general principles. There are only procedures for establishing principles and truths. Procedure -&gt; Principles -&gt; Truth.</li>
  <li>Conflicts must be handled by (1) reflective equilibrium - checking coherence with other beliefs/truths, and (2) by appeal to higher level principles that are agreed upon. Applies to individual beliefs and interpersonal disagreement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prudential</strong></p>

<p>Constructivism provides an easy explanation of the following norms of practical reasoning.</p>

<p>Constitutive Features</p>

<ol>
  <li>End-Satisfaction: agents have reason to satisfy their ends.</li>
  <li>Instrumental: agents have reason to adopt the means to satisfy their ends.</li>
  <li>Time: agents have reason to satisfy the goals of their future self. 
 Agents justified in criticizing the goals of our past selves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Other Features. May not be constitutive (?), but depend on features implicit in most people</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conflict: how to deal with conflicting goals? 
 Is there a goal hierarchy? 
 Ends constitutive of one’s identity (i.e. valuing reflection) trump conflicting ends.</li>
  <li>Feasibility: goals which are more likely to be satisfied trump equivalent goals that cannot be satisfied.</li>
  <li>Pain/Suffering: pain/suffering provides one with reason to avoid it is precisely because people judge that they have reason to avoid it (or they have an unreflective aversion towards it). 
 If a person had no (un)reflective aversion toward pain, then there would be no actual reason to avoid it. 
 It is not the pure sensation of pain that provides us with reason to avoid it.</li>
  <li>Desires: a desire to X tends to provide one with reason to X because
    <ul>
      <li>people tend to judge that they have reason to X if they desire to X, and</li>
      <li>all intentional actions are done because of some desire; otherwise, they would be involuntary actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="against-consequentialism">Against consequentialism</h3>

<p>For a particular agent, their reasons need not be consequentialist. For example, this is true insofar as the agent accepts that they have reason to hold certain attitudes, attitudes that cannot be reduced to merely promoting some desired state of affairs. For example, an agent might value friendship, meaning they think they have reason to be loyal to their friends, care about their interests, etc. These reasons are not reasons to promote some state of affairs. This would imply that there could be some end state of affairs that would justify them betraying these current reasons to reach that desired state, but this need not be what an agent has reason to do.</p>

<p>In sum, not all reasons are teleological, i.e. all states of affairs are given some amount of weight which can be theoretically quantified which competes against are conflicting states of affairs. Instead, there reasons can be structural, where some features are given zero weight due to higher order reasons.</p>

<p>Kinds of consequentialism:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Maximizing - Define some good which can be quantified, we have most reason to act so as to promote that quantity. This can be disproven above.</li>
  <li>Trivial - Rank possible states of affairs according to how you judge yourself to have most reason to act. Have a complete ranking of all the states. Because constructivism is true, we have most reason to promote that state of affairs. This seems trivially true.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

<p>Objectivity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no objectivity in the mind-independence sense. But there is a kind of objectivity in terms of what is constituitive of agency itself. E.g. in order to count as an agent who values anything, they must take themselves to have reason to adopt the means to fulfill their ends, they must value their capacity for agency, etc.</li>
  <li>One might doubt whether this is a important kind of objectivity. They might say: you are cheating by talking about what is valuable after presupposing someone is an agent. This isn’t really interesting.
–&gt; Response: this is the same kind of objectivity that we get with deductive reasoning. I.e. the only reason P -&gt; P, ~(P ^ ~P), (P-&gt;Q ^ P) -&gt; Q, etc. is because of what it is to believe a proposition to be true. It is constituitive of belief that one not believe contradictions. Indeed, for “agents” without these tendencies, we wouldn’t be able to rationally persuade them otherwise. But it’s not clear that the concept of “rationality” even applies to them. They’re neither rational nor irrational. No one questions the objectivity here:
—&gt; One might still question its objectivity because it doesn’t have the mind-independence. In that case, I question if this usage of “objectivity” is interesting or important. What does it take to call something “objectivity”? I look to the role that “objectivity” plays in discourse. When we call something objectivity, we apply this to domains of propositions that (1) people can be mistaken about, (2) we can criticize others/ourselves about, (3) we can have improve about, (4) we can disagree about, etc. The characterization given thus far fulfills that role. 
—&gt; Speaking of roles, think of normative “truth”. When we attribute the predicate TRUE to a normative judgment about what one ought to do, this implies something above and beyond typical desires:
—&gt; That that judgment will be more <em>stable</em> than other desires upon reflection. So reflective stability under ideal deliberation is a test for rationality among agents. Reflective stability under idealized <em>conditions</em> can be a test for the <em>reasons</em> of an agent (where the idealized conditions are the conditions that an agent endorses under ideal deliberation, i.e. full information, full experience, fully imaginative, etc.). Might stability under idealized social negotiation be a test <em>moral reasons</em>. Stability is one of the reasons why our value of reflection has normative authority over any conflicting unreflective judgments we might have.</li>
  <li>Another “kind” of objectivity. It may not be constituitive of agency per se, but it is nearly universal among humans:
—&gt; Standing in mutual recognition with other agents (i.e. being a moral agent). As an agent, one doesn’t <em>have</em> to care about this. But almost all agents do. Because for the ones who did not, they would have had a difficult time spreading their genes. Of course, evolutionarily, the circle of mutual recognition was often small, limited to one’s tribe or in-group. But we have the rational capacity to question whether differences between tribes are actually relevant, and most will conclude that they are not. This is not only evolutionarily necessary, it is also neurologically necessary for all current humans. Humans who are not touched and played with as infants either die or grow to have developmental disorders.
—&gt; A similar non-constituitive “tendency” that agents have is to value the values of their future self. This need not be constituitive of agency. However, it is near-universal among humans for very similar reasons as being a moral agent. For those who did not, they would have had a difficult time spreading their genes. Of course, our tendency to plan for the future is often limited based on certain factors (i.e. impulsivity, excitement, etc.), but we can question whether those considerations are rationally relevant, and most will conclude that they are not. [there is a further question as to whether caring for future selves commits one to care about other persons. This is a question I will not answer].</li>
  <li>Different kinds of constituitive features:
—&gt; Constituitive of psychological attitudes: Fear -&gt; Attributions of danger
—&gt; Constituitive of linguistic concepts: thick ethical concepts, coward -&gt; attribution of fear
—&gt; Constructed social norms: moral norms -&gt; impartial concern with others. Based on the role or function that the norms plays in our lives. Find the job description of morality. E.g. compare with ettiquette, science, etc. Morality is like thick ethical concepts in that sense. For that reason, they can sometimes be used non-motivationally, e.g. someone who sincerely (i.e. not in the “inverted comma” sense) says “X is a generous” might not have any motivation by focusing on the descriptive component of the thick ethical concept “generous” - i.e. that he give to others, etc. Likewise, someone can sincerely judge “X is wrong” without any motivational by focusing on the thick component of wrongness - i.e. that others have reason to blame one for this, that people motivated to stand in mutual recognition have reason to accept the norm, etc. The thick component here is also normative (i.e. it uses the concept of a reason), but it need not be motivational, because it relates to reasons for other people. So it may just express a disposition for motivation of the speaker in certain counterfactual circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="desire-theories">Desire Theories</h2>

<p>!!! danger “Deprecate”
	Delete this section. Consider the pros and cons of desire theories when discussing the merits of various forms of internalism.</p>

<p>This examines theories for normative correctness that reduce in some way to an agents desires, whether first-order or higher-order, actual or hypothetical, etc.</p>

<h3 id="humean-model">Humean Model</h3>

<p>The Humean theory of rationality states the following</p>

<p>A has a reason to X if and only if (1) X promotes A’s desire d and (2) d is not based on any false beliefs. This can be simplified to: A has a reason to X if and only if X promotes a foundational (rather than derivative) desire in A. Desires are then the upshot of the following</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full information</li>
  <li>Correct means-end deliberation (generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that X -&gt; Y).</li>
</ul>

<p>Desires can be given three components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A certain positive or negative sensation</li>
  <li>A disposition to promote some state of affairs</li>
  <li>An unreflective normative judgment that one has reason to promote a state of affairs</li>
</ul>

<p>Not clear if an “urge” can be reduced to a sensation/disposition pair.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>These are problems insofar as desires are divorced from normative judgments (e.g. plans, goals, etc.).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normativity of desires: Why would a desire, in terms of just sensations and dispositions, provide someone with reasons for action? Imagine someone had a disposition where they just felt the urge to turn on radios whenever they saw one but they didn’t think they had any reason to do so. Imagine A is injected with a drug that makes him crave the drug much more, and this is his strongest desire by far. Does he have most reason to take the drug?</li>
  <li>Disconnects: Assume the normativity of desires are accounted for. How to account for disconnects between an agent’s reasons and their desires? These disconnects can happen under physical addiction, emotional disturbances, psychological compulsions, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>We sometimes have reasons without corresponding desires - e.g. weakness of will</li>
      <li>We sometimes have desires without corresponding reasons - e.g. addictions</li>
      <li>These cannot be accounted for with full information. There can be degenerate desires that are produced from, or persist despite, full information. Imagine that if a person became fully informed about all the germs on one’s hands, this would trigger a natural underived disgust reaction in the person, causing them to never touch anything directly and to constantly wash their hands everyday. Imagine that they are aware that the germs cause no actual danger or harm. They would be against coming into contact with germs because of an intrinsic disgust reaction, and they would think, all things else considered, satisfying their desire to reduce germs is more important than the sacrifice that doing so requires. The fact that full information would produce certain responses in people doesn’t make those responses rational.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Priority: Assume the disconnect between reasons and desires is accounted for (perhaps by looking at a mode of desires). On this model, the authority of desires are simply based on their “strength”.
    <ul>
      <li>How does this account for the authority we want to give to categorically superior desires? E.g. the priority of higher-order desires or desires under full experience, reflection, sound state of mind, etc. which may have low strength?</li>
      <li>How can we ground criticisms of fully informed desires that are based on inexperience, lack of reflection, unsound, etc.?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prudence: Why agents have reason to satisfy the desires of their future self?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dispositionalism--sophisticated-humean-model">Dispositionalism / Sophisticated Humean Model</h3>

<p>The idealization for discovering reasons requires, at a minimum, full information and correct means-end-deliberation. Some other possibilities include. We can supplement the Humean model by incorportating other requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fully Informed</li>
  <li>Correct means-end deliberation.</li>
  <li>Reflection - desires endorsed under reflection have priority over others
    <ul>
      <li>Using imagination to determine how a desire would be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Deciding which desires one places most weight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Soundness - free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances.</li>
  <li>Fully Experienced - not merely knowledge of a proposition p, but exposure to a stimuli (i.e. a perception, an argument, etc.) that provokes the attitude.</li>
  <li>Systematically unified desires.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reasons = Full Experience + Full Information + Full Reflection + Sound mental state + …</p>

<p>At bottom, the concern is that we are starting with an agent’s given motivational set and find a sound deliberative route or procedure with the aforemention properties to discover reasons.</p>

<p>Some theories allow the creation/destruction of underived desires. Williams and Smith think this allows for the creation and destruction of underived desires via imagination and, for Smith, the focus on unification. Smith takes a more radical approach in that he believes certain seemingly arational desires (e.g. desiring value only one’s interests at the expense of others) are irrational. This is because some theories are “fully rational”, not merely fully informed, where “fully rational” extends beyond correct ends-means deliberation. This is necessary to handle irrational desires.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>Hasn’t solved the following problems from above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normativity of desires: why do mere sensations/dispositions even under idealized circumstances, in the absence of a normative judgment, provide a reason for action? It doesn’t seem that they do. Instead, we should focus on the normative judgments an agent would make (e.g. their plans, goals), under these idealized conditions.</li>
  <li>Unification: what do these conditions all have in common? It cannot just be that we all desire to satisfy the desires that we would have under these conditions because not everyone has this desire.</li>
  <li>Priority: assume everyone does actually desire the desires they would have under idealized conditions. What gives these desires the priority that they have? On desire-based theories, priority must be determined purely by “strength” and very often we can have desires that are stronger than our desire to satisfy the desires we would have under idealized conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>??? example “Ideal Observer”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>See: Peter Railton, Michael Smith

Ideal agent vs Ideal Observer: *Ideal agent*: an agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of themselves, A+, would desire to X in C. *Ideal Observer*: an ideal agent A has reason to X in circumstances C if and only if an ideal version of the agent, A+, would desire that A desires to X in C. 

*Observer-based not agent-based.* The reasons that X has reduces to whether A+ would desire A to desire X, not whether A+ would desire X. This is because doing otherwise cannot account for reasons under uncertainty. Consider the case when one has reason to seek new information. A fully informed being would have no desire to seek information, even though they have reason to do so.

It's not clear why this means we should focus on observers rather than agents. For example, imagine the case where someone drinks a glass of soda that they believe to be water and they desire to drink water. We can easily say that they have reason to not drink from the glass, even though they do have reason to drink from the glass given the information that they have. In this case, there is no problem with saying someone has most reason to do something which they have no rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs. Likewise, it seems we can say that people don't actually have reason to seek information, but rather they have reason to seek information given their currently held beliefs. There is no problem with saying, for example, that someone lost in the woods has most reason to take route X, even though this is not something which they have a rational way of endorsing given their currently held beliefs.

**Problems** 

- They cannot account for degenerate idealized counterparts. What if a fully idealized counterpart, A+, desired that his less idealized counterpart, A, do something that he didn't have reason to do? What if A+ was viscious? The only way to avoid this conclusion is by assuming that some desire or concern for the sake of others is somehow constitutive of a fully rational agent. But this seems dubious. This is especially dubious for theories that allow any non-self-defeating desire in principle to be rational (unlike, e.g. Smith who thinks that something like this might be constitutive of a fully rational agent). But these seem like poor candidates for an analysis as they are assuming substantive desires as being rational in their analysis... This, combined with the earlier notes on ideal observer, might be enough to ignore the observer aspect and focus on the agent. We can distinguish what to do under uncertainty versus full information by distinguishing rationality and reasons.
- ~~~They cannot account for rationality in general. Take an analysis of reasons for belief. A world-to-mind fit analysis might say "A has reason to believe X in C iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would desire that A believed X in C". But this certainly does not seem to be true. Let's assume A+ is concerned ultimately with the welfare of A above all else (which is a dubious assumption as mentioned earlier). Then this certainly makes it possible for there to be cases where A+ desires that A believes X even though A has normative reason to not believe X, e.g. if believing X made A's life worse, even though it was justified. Theories about the direct beliefs of A+ (i.e. "A has reason to believe X iff an idealized version of himself, A+, would believe X in those circumstances") fail because (1) insofar as the idealization involves full information, this is flawed because the reasons to hold a belief are not determined by the truth of that belief, and (2) insofar as the idealization involves full rationality, it is circular.~~~ Actually, this can account for rationality in general. The full information requirement is not to account for *rationality*, but to account for *reasons*. It is full information + rationality that provides reasons. The account of rationality is independent from full information, and this account can be extended to other domains.

<h3 id="general-problems">General Problems</h3>

<p>General problems with desire accounts and counterfactual attitude accounts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The elements posited as providing reasons (desires, informed desires, motivations, ideal desires, ideal observer’s desires, etc.) don’t necessarily provide reasons, i.e. when they disconnect with an agent’s normative judgments. Consider a case where dispositionalism (but not constructivism) would say someone has reason. On what grounds can the person be said to have that reason if they are not in some way committed to the action?</li>
  <li>Insofar as they do provide reasons, constructivism explains why they provide reasons, why they matter and a unifying theme explaining the authority of the elements that do matter. E.g. if certain features are constituitive of agency, caring about desires under experience, future desires, etc.</li>
  <li>Constructivism can give a clean general account of all reasons.
    <ul>
      <li>How to give a metaphysical account of reasons for belief? One response is that one has reason to believe P only if they would believe P in circumstance P. How to account for a reason to believe <em>that</em> counterfactual? The response is that one has reason to believe that they would believe P in circumstances C iff they would believe that “they would believe P in circumstances C” in circumstances C. This is circular… This may not actually be an issue on the metaphysical/epistemic level. It may still be an issue on the linguistic/psychological level, however.</li>
