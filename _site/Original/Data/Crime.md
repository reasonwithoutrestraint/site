----- Poverty -----

The link between the two isn't even that particularly strong. For the years 2006-2011, the Census-ACS provides estimates of the Mean Income, Median Income, and Poverty Rates for each urban center, allowing us to look at the correlations between crime, income and race. The correlations between the Mean Income and Median Income leves and the various crime categories generally fall in the range of -0.30 to -0.60, being moderately rather than strongly negative, usually well below our racial figures:


This is why when we look at places like Kentucky, home to a population that has the second highest white poverty rate in the nation (yet a violent crime rate that is 40 percent lower than the national average)

Appalachia is almost entirely white and the poorest region in the country. We see horrible rates of poverty, yet the crime that plagues Detroit, Norfolk, Richmond, Baltimore, St. Louis, Atlanta, Memphis isn't found.

‘Yet, The violent crime rate for Appalachia in 2010 was lower than the national violent crime rate average by 56.76%’

----- IQ -----

73% of the incarceration disparities is erased when we fix to persons with average IQ. For 29-year-olds, 13% of Blacks had ever been interviewed in a correctional facility (a proxy for incarceration), compared to 2% of Whites. For persons of average IQ (100), the number drops to 5% for Blacks and 2% for Whites (page 338 of The Bell Curve).

Gottfredson (1998) observes that youths with IQ of 75–90 are seven times more likely to be incarcerated than those with IQ of 110–125, and states: ‘‘no other trait or circumstance yet studied is so deeply implicated in the nexus of bad social outcomes’’ as low IQ.
