# Anti-Humean Theory of Normative Reasons

Hume believed that whereas our beliefs can be assessed in terms of truth or falsehood, and so could be rationally assessed baed on their truth, our desires could not be assessed in those terms. Therefore, desires are beyond rational criticism. What it is rational for an agent to do is to simply maximize his present desires. This section rejects the Humean theory of normative reasons in favor of an anti-Humean theory.

## Valuing

*Deliberative and inentional*. Intentional action can be explained from two perspectives, the *intentional* and the *deliberative*. From the intentional perspective, intentional action can be explained by citiing *motivating reasons*, i.e. by citing a belief-desire pair that fits into a pattern of teleological explanation. From the deliberative perspective, intentional action can be explained by citing *normative reasons*, i.e. by citing a pattern of rational deliberation that either did, or could have, produced it. This involves citing the considerations that one reflects over in deciding what to do. 

*Connection between normative and motivational*. The deliberative perspective must be explanatory because when we decide what to do after deliberation, that often makes a difference in what we do. This would be impossible if the deliberative perspective were not explanatory, since the connection between deliberation and our action would be purely causally contingent. Thus, our attitudes, call them *values*, towards the propositions that figure in our deliberations must be capable of figuring an explanation of our action. This introduces a conflict, for it must be explained how deliberative explanation in terms of *valuing* and believing relates to the intentional explanation in terms of *desiring* and believing.

*Disconnect between normative and motivational.* We must think there is some connection bewteen desires and values because, again, values in deliberation must be capable of explanation and the only explanation of action must be desires. However, there must also be some slack between desires and values. An agent may desire to X without valuing to X (e.g. kleptomaniac, addicts, etc.). Likewise, an agent may value X without desiring to X (e.g. the depressed, weakness of will). In general, due to psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc. there is an imperfect connection between what an agent judges to be a normative reasons for action (i.e. what they value) and the agent's motivating reasons for action (i.e. what they desire). The puzzle is to explain the psychology of valuing that can respect these plattitudes. It would seem that conceptualizing valuing as a belief cannot explain how normative reasons can be motivating, but it also seems that conceptualizing valuing as a desire cannot explain how one's values conflict with their desires.

## Valuing as Desiring

*Plain Desires*. The simplest explanation would be to say that valuing simply is desiring. Judging something valuable is to desire it. In other words, when one expresses that they have normative reason to X (e.g. that they value X), they are merely expressing a desire. The problem with this is it doesn't allow for the cases where desire and valuing come apart (e.g. cases of weakness of will, depression, addiction, etc.), where someone has no desire corresponding to their values, or vice-versa.

*Mode of desiring*. Another explanation states that valuing is a mode of desiring. An agent values X if and only if she desires X after certain tests of reflection and experience, without interference from psychological compulsion, addictions, depressions, emotional distress, etc. Valuing is a kind of reflectively endorsed, informed desire in a psychologically sound state of mind. This may be sufficient to explain how we can desire something without valuing it (e.g. if we desired it in the inappropriate state of mind), but it would do nothing to show how we could value something without desiring it. 

*Higher order desire*. Finally, one might say that valuing can be reduced to a desire for a desire. This conception satisfies the earlier requirements for a conception of values. It can explain how someone can desire X without valuing X (for one can desire X without having a higher-order desire in favor of that desire), and it can explain how one can value X without desiring X (for one can desire to desire X without actually desiring X). However, there are two separate problems with this:

But first, note one constraint on a conception of normative reasons: 

> C1: if A judges that he has normative reason to X, then he rationally should desire to X.

1. The reduction of valuing to desiring to desire cannot meet C1. If an agent has a conflicting second-order and first-order desire, it is equally rational for him to abandon either desire. In fact, on Hume's conception of rationality, he should mantain whichever desire is the strongest, which could be the first-order desire. One could object and state that instead of appealing solely to the *strength* of a desire as suggested by Hume, we also appeal to its *content*; it is rational to favor a second-order desire over a first-order desire, regardless of strength. But there are no independent arguments in favor of this conception of the rationality of desire; this is an ad-hoc rationalization to reconcile this theory of value with the constraint on normative reasons.
2. There is no reason to identify valuing with second-order desires as opposed to third- or fourth-order desires. There is no non-arbitrary reason to identify valuing with any particular level of desiring. Each level of desiring seems as plausible as the other, which means all identifications are equally implausible.

## Valuing as Believing

The question is how to conceptualize valuing as believing in a way that meets the defeasible connection between valuing and desiring mentioned above, and in a way that meets constraint C1. Re-articulated in the form of a belief, C1 can be expressed as C2

> C2: if A believes that he has normative reason to X, then he rationally should desire to X.

This can be met with an analysis based on the following plattitude: what we have normative reason to do is what we would desire that we do if we were fully rational. This can be transformed into a complete analysis as follows: 

> for A to judge that he has normative reason to do X in circumstances C is for A to judge that a fully rational version of himself, A+, would desire A to X in C.

### The Role of Introspection

This does not reduce value judgments to introspective judgments about our desires. Values judgments are the product of rational deliberation. An agent's desires may figure in this deliberative process as the *objects* of evaluation. However, the actual value judgments concern what an full rational version of the agent would desire. This is not an *instrospective* fact about the agent, but rather a *hypothetical* fact about the agent against which one's desirs can be evaluated. While introspection may provide a useful means to learn about what one would hypothetically desire, one's hypothetical desires are not constituted by or reduced to introspective facts about the agent.

### Normative/Motivational disconnect

This analysis can clearly account for cases where one's judged normative reasons diverge from their motivating reasons. For, what an agent believes about her hypothetical desires is rather disassociated from her actual desires. One's desires are irrational to the extent that they are wholly or solely the product of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc., to the extent that they wouldn't be had if it weren't for those conditions. These conditions, however, would be imagined away as one imagines the psychology of their fully informed self, because these features have no constitutive role to play in the psychology of a fully rational agent. 

### Fully Rational

Some of the plattitudes concerning full rationality include the following (as given by Bernard William's explicit analysis of rationality): 

- The agent holds no false beliefs.
- The agent holds all relevant true beliefs, etc. for example. 
- The agent deliberates correctly.

The features of correct deliberation may be a substantive question. But some possibilities include the following: 

- Means-end deliberation (the generation of a desire to X as a result of combining a desire to Y and a belief that doing X does Y).
- Deciding how the satisfaction of one's desire can be satisfied. 
- Deciding which desire one attaches most weight to.
- Using vivid imagination (in place of belief) to determine how a desire could be satisfied, or what it might be like. 
- Deliberation free of psychological compulsions, physical addictions, emotional disturbances, etc.
- Systematically justifying one's desires. Just as unity is partially constitutive of having a rationally justified set of beliefs, so to unity is partially constitutive of having a rationally justified set of desires. It is rationally preferrable to have desires that do not conflcit. Further, it is rationally preferrable to have one's desires explained and guided by general principles rather than a batch of unrelated desires. The belief that adopting/abandoning certain desires leads to a more unified set of desires would motivate a rational to make that change, insofar as they are rational. 

Some of these procedures, e.g. imagination, systematic justification, etc., can be used to create and destroy underived desires.

### Summary-style and non-reductive 

This analysis gives a summary-style (rather than explicit) notion of being fully rational. This is to capture a host of specific platitudes about practical rationality (some of the plattitudes were given above). It is also non-reductive because describing what it is to be fully rational required the use of normative concepts (the notion of a set of attitudes being "unified" is a normative concept). It's not clear whether normative concepts are vulnerable to a permutation problem, but it seems that they probably are because (1) much of our normative concepts are interdefined are a learned via paradigmatic cases rather than via non-normative concepts, and (2) all historical analyses of normative concepts into non-normative concepts have been spectacular failures. Regardless, being reductive and explicit is not a necessary requirement of an adequate analysis.

### Non-relative conception of normative reasons

There is a certain sort of relativity in our concept of normative reasons, in the sense that the normative reasons an agent has, i.e. what she would have if she were fully rational, are a functions from her actual desires. The relevant functions are given by the standards of correct deliberation given above. It might be the case that this leads to reasons prescribing different behaviors for different agents. However, this doesn't preclude the possibility of a non-relative cooncept of normative reasons. The differences in desires of different fully rational agents could be due to different *circumstances* rather than different *reasons*. What's required for a non-relative concept of reasons is that fully rational agents converge in their hypothetical desires about what is to be done in various circumstances that they might find themselves. For example, a non-relative concept of normative reasons is compatible with saying that A has normative reason to X in circumstances C1 whereas B has normative reason to Y in circumstances C2, so long as both A and B have reason to X in C1 and Y in C2. 

This also shows that normative reasons are categorical reasons rather than hypothetical, because they are not functions of our *actual* desires; they are functions of the hypothetical, ideal desires we would have. And, given that this is a non-relative conception of normative reasons, one's actual desires should have no special significance of one's reasons. 

This is a conceptual claim, not a substantial one; it says nothing about whether there are any such reasons. This can be discovered only by engaging in moral argument and observing the effects.

### The deliberative and intentional perspective

This explains the apparent conflict in the deliberative and intentional perspectives on explanations of action. All intentional actions are explicable from the intentional perspective in terms of our desires and beliefs. However, to the extent that we are rational, our desires are themselves sensitive to our beliefs about our reasons. Just as rational agents tend to desire the what they judge to be means to an end that they desire, so too do rational agents tend to desire what they judge it rational to desire, i.e. what they believe they would desire if they were rational. Thus, intentional actions are also explicable from the deliberative perspective, insofar as the desires responsible for intentional actions are modified by our normative beliefs. This explains why between normative reasons and motivating reasons are connected but not perfect, for our tendency to be rational (specifically, our tendency to modify our desires in accordance with our normative judgments) is itself imperfect.
