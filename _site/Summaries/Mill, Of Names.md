General vs Individual:
- General: denotes an unbounded number of things, e.g. "man" denotes John, "man" denotes Adam, "man" dnotes Bob, etc.
- Individual: denotes one thing, e.g. "John" (once the sense is made clear) denotes a single person (whoever is intended to be referred to)

Collective vs Non-collective:
- Collective: denotes a group of things, e.g. "family", John isn't one's family, Adam isn't one's family, but one's family is John and Adam
	- General: "family" denotes my family (containing me, A, B and C), "family" denotes your family (containing you, X, Y and Z).
	- Individual: the first family - denotes the set containing the president, his spouse, children, pets, etc.
- Non-Collective: denotes a single thing, e.g. "brother", John is one's brother, Adam is one's brother

Concrete vs Abstract:
- Concrete: denotes a thing, "White", x is White
- Abstract: denotes an attribute of a thing, "Whiteness", x posseses whiteness
	- General: denotes many different attributes
		- "Color": whiteness, redness, etc. Whiteness is a color, redness is a color, etc.
		- "Weight": 40 pounds, 50 pounds, etc. 40 pounds is a weight, 50 pounds is a weight, etc.
	- Individual: denotes a single attribute
		- "visibleness", "tangibleness", "squareness"
		- Denotes an attribute of many thing, but it always denotes the *same* attribute. E.g. there is one notion of "tangibleness", but multiple notions of "weight" (40 pounds, 50 pounds, etc.)


Connotative vs Non-connotative
- Non-Connotative: denotes a thing only, or denotes an attribute only
	- E.g. John, England, London, etc. merely denote a thing. 
	- They don't have any meaning. They don't tell you anything about the thing they denote.
	- They are merely meant to produce in one's minds a recollection of something we already understand.
- Connotative: denotes a thing AND implies an attribute
	- E.g. "white"
	- "White" denotes many things: glue, clouds, eggs, etc.
	- But also implies attributes for these things: *whiteness*
	- The meaning of a name is found in its connotation not in its denotation (i.e. what it stands for)
	- Thus, there could be two names that denoted the same things, but which can have different meanings (because they imply different attributes). e.g. "all people over 6 foot in the room" and "all basketball players in the room" might denote the same class of people but they have different meanings. 

- Concrete general names: always connotative. In order for them to denote an unbounded number of things, it must be in virtue of the fact that the names connote additional properties. And it contains all thing with those properties, which is unbounded.
- General abstract: sometimes are connotative
- Individual names: 
	- Proper names: not connotative
	- Seeming examples: "God", "The Sun", etc. But these are not *in principle* individual. They may be *in fact* individual due to our beliefs. But language does not require this. There could in principle be multiple Gods, suns, etc. (but there couldn't be multiple "Adam's") 
	- Solid Examples: "The *only* son of Caeser", "The *first* kind of Rome". Don't just denote things, but also connote attributes
