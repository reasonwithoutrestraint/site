General
- Sense: 
	- grasped by everyone who is sufficiently familiar with the language
	- mode of presentation of a symbol/sign
- Reference:
	- What is denoted by the symbol/sign
	- When we wish to speak of words or symbols themselves, e.g. when using quotations, these words have an indirect reference:	
		- The reference of "A" isn't the reference of A, i.e. its customary sense.
		- Rather, it's reference is its sense, i.e. indirect reference
- Idea
	- internal image
	- object perceivable by sentence
	- Two thinkers cannot adopt the same ideas, but they can express the same senses, and refer to the same things
Names
	- Express senses
	- Designate references

Sentence:
- Sense: 
	- We are concerned with the sense of a sentence when we are concerned with only the senses of the parts of the sentence
	- The thought of a sentence is its sense
- Reference
	- We are concerned with whenever we are concerned with only the references of the parts of the sentence
	- The truth value of a sentence constitutes its truth value
		- Should it be truth conditions? E.g. to handle counterfactuals and possible worlds
		- Seems like "2+2=4" and "there are more women than men do not have the same referent"
	- The truth value of a sentence is only determined by the reference of its components (usually)
Judgment
	- Occurs only when one connects a thought with a reference
	- The thought alone doesn't connect a thought with a reference (truth value)

Clauses / Subordinate sentences:
	- This happens after "say", "hear", "conclude", etc.
	- The refernece of these clauses is the sense/thought of the clause.
	- In this case, the words are concerned with their indirect reference.
	- Thus, we can say that the noun clauses refer to thoughts, not truth values

The reference of a sentence is not always its truth value when the word has its indirect reference.

Some clauses do not have thoughts as their sense
	- E.g. "whoever discovered X has property Y"
	- The clause "whoever discovered X" has as its reference a person, not a truth value.
	- Also, the sense is not a thought
	- It cannot be a thought because it doesn't predicate anything of the person involved
