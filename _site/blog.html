      <p><p>I will be assuming determinism is true. So whether we have free will depends on whether compatibilism is true. My post here will argue for determinism. The first thing to settle when having these debates is meaning. We need to determine what we <em>mean</em> by “free will”. <em>What beliefs are we expressing when we say someone has free will?</em> After settling meaning, then we can determine whether people sometimes actually have free will or not. Obviously, if “free will” is <em>defined</em> as some sort of incompatibilist free will, then incompatibilism is true; no argument needed. But it’s equally true that if “free will” is <em>defined</em> as compatibilist free will, then compatibilism is true; no argument needed. Neither of these definitions illuminate the compatibilism/incompatibilism debate.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/06/19/Normative-Correctness.html">Normative correctness</a></h2>
      <p><p>Existence internalism characterizes rationality without explicitly requiring any particular motivations. Note that this does not reduce internalism to an Actual Motivational view whereby an agent needs to be actually motivated to perform the action. Usually, rationality is specified by some form of <em>ideal</em> deliberation, i.e. R is a reason for agent A if and only if R is the upshot of <em>sound, valid, fully imaginative</em> (from Williams) deliberation. Other forms of internalism might require being in a sound state of mind, having full experience, etc. In other words, normative reasons are the rational extension of one’s motivating reasons. A consideration C counts as a reason if and only if there is some rational procedure from an agent’s motivational reasons to C (without presupposing any new motivational states along the way).</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/06/19/Moral-Reasons.html">Moral reasons</a></h2>
      <p><p>Moral judgments are deeply tied to distinctly moral emotions and attitudes - blame and guilt. There are two ways that moral judgments are associated with these basic attitudes. Firstly, agents who make moral judgments directly express those attitudes, or a disposition to have those attitudes in certain situations. Secondly, agents who make moral judgments express a normative judgment that said attitudes are appropriate, i.e. they express their <em>endorsement</em> of those attitudes in certain situations. First, let us discuss the motivational implications of moral judgments. When an agent makes a moral judgment, (1) the agent is disposed to regulate his behavior as prescribed by the judgment, (2) he is disposed to feel guilt himself for violating the standard, and (3) he is disposed to blame others for violating the perscribed standard. Oftentimes, the agent thinks others are <em>capable</em> of being motivated to regulate their behavior in accord with the norm, i.e. they would be receptive to the reasons favoring the norm. E.g. while it might make sense for A to <em>dislike</em> B’s preference for ice crean, it doesn’t make sense for A to <em>disapprove</em> of B’s preference for ice cream, but it would make sense if B regarded A as his dietary adviser. This is true even when B’s actions might harm A. E.g. it doesn’t make sense for A to disapprove of B’s attack against him if B would be completely unreceptive (e.g. animal, child, evil person, aliens etc.), but it would make sense for someone who was receptive (i.e. normal rational agent).</p>
